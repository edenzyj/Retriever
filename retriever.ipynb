Much \\nof the early literature used this name to refer to fungi associated \\nwith various diseases of Citrus, with other species established for \\nmorphologically similar fungi from other hosts. However, several \\nearly papers discussed the morphological similarity between many \\nof the Colletotrichum spp. that had been described on the basis of \\nhost preference, and used inoculation tests to question whether or \\nnot the species were distinct. Some of these papers investigated \\nin culture the link between the various Colletotrichum species and \\ntheir sexual Glomerella state (e.g. Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia \\n& Agati 1925). Authors such as Shear & Wood (1907, 1913) and \\nSmall (1926) concluded that many of the species described on the \\nbasis of host preference were in fact the same, rejecting apparent \\ndifferences in host preference as a basis for taxonomic segregation. \\nSmall (1926) concluded that the names Glomerella cingulata and \\nColletotrichum gloeosporioides should be used for the sexual and \\nasexual morphs, respectively, of the many Colletotrichum spp. \\nthey regarded as conspecific. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides \\nwas stated to be the earliest name with a proven link to what they'), Document(page_content='regarded as a biologically diverse G. cingulata. The studies of \\nvon Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970) taxonomically \\nformalised this concept.'), Document(page_content='The “von Arxian” taxonomic concept for Colletotrichum \\nsaw large numbers of species synonymised with the names C. \\ngraminicola (for grass-inhabiting species) and C. gloeosporioides \\n(for non-grass inhabiting species with straight conidia). The \\ngenetic and biological diversity encompassed by these names \\nwas so broad that they became of little practical use to plant \\npathologists, conveying no information about pathogenicity, host \\nrange, or other attributes. The von Arx & Müller (1954) and von \\nArx (1957) studies were not based on direct examination of type \\nmaterial of all species and some of the synonymy proposed \\nin these papers has subsequently been found to be incorrect. \\nExamples include the segregation of C. acutatum (Simmonds \\n1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al. 2003) from C. \\ngloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1957). Other studies published \\nelsewhere in this volume (Damm et al. 2012a, b) show that \\nseveral species regarded as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides \\nby von Arx (1957) are members of the C. acutatum complex \\n(e.g. C. godetiae, Gloeosporium limetticola, G. lycopersici, and \\nG. phormii) or the C. boninense complex (e.g. C. dracaenae). \\nRecent molecular studies have resulted in a much better \\nunderstanding of phylogenetic relationships amongst the'), Document(page_content='StudieS in Mycology 73: 115–180.\\n\\nOpen access under CC BY-NC-ND license.\\n\\nhttp://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc-nd/3.0/\\n\\n\\nWeir et al.\\n\\n116'), Document(page_content='grass-inhabiting species of the C. graminicola group and the \\ndevelopment of a more useful taxonomy for this group of fungi \\n(e.g. Hsiang & Goodwin 2001, Du et al. 2005, and Crouch et \\nal. 2006). This group is now recognised as comprising several \\nhost-specialised, genetically well characterised species, but a \\nmodern taxonomy for C. gloeosporioides has yet to be resolved.'), Document(page_content='Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C. \\ngloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently \\nhost-specialised, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these \\nauthors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to \\nunderstand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic \\nconcepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host \\nspecies, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria, \\ngrowth rate in culture, colour of cultures, presence or absence of \\nsetae, whether or not the teleomorph develops, etc. Some studies \\nhave found characters such as these useful for distinguishing \\ngroups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956, \\nHindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems \\narise because many of these morphological features change under \\ndifferent conditions of growth (dependent upon growth media, \\ntemperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or change with repeated \\nsubculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled — even good, well-\\ndefined pathogens causing a specific disease can be isolated by \\nchance from other substrates (e.g. Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum \\nconidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium, \\nremain attached to that surface as a viable propagule or perhaps as \\na minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow out from there into \\nsenescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity. \\nIn addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct \\nsets of isolates, the shared pathogenicity presumably independently \\nevolved, e.g. the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members \\nof both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes \\n(Johnston et al. 2005).'), Document(page_content='Sutton (1992) commented on C. gloeosporioides that “No \\nprogress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging \\nto this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone”. \\nA start was made towards a modern understanding of this name \\nwith the designation of an epitype specimen with a culture derived \\nfrom it to stabilise the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). \\nBased on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs in a \\nstrongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have been \\nconfused with C. gloeosporioides in the past, such as C. acutatum \\nand C. boninense (e.g. Abang et al. 2002, Martinez-Culebras et \\nal. 2003, Johnston et al. 2005, Chung et al. 2006, Farr et al. 2006, \\nThan et al. 2008).

In \\nall cases the taxa we include in the C. gloeosporioides complex \\nwould fit within the traditional morphological concept of the C. \\ngloeosporioides group (e.g. von Arx 1970, Mordue 1971, and \\nSutton 1980). Commonly used species names within the C. \\ngloeosporioides complex include C. fragariae, C. musae, and C. \\nkahawae. Since the epitype paper (Cannon et al. 2008), several \\nnew C. gloeosporioides-like species have been described in \\nregional studies, where multi-gene analyses have shown the new \\nspecies to be phylogenetically distinct from the ex-epitype strain of \\nC. gloeosporioides (e.g. Rojas et al. 2010, Phoulivong et al. 2011,  \\nand Wikee et al. 2011).'), Document(page_content='The regional nature of most of these studies, the often restricted \\ngenetic sampling across the diversity of C. gloeosporioides globally, \\nand the minimal overlap between isolates treated and gene regions \\ntargeted in the various studies, means that the relationship between \\nthe newly described species is often poorly understood.'), Document(page_content='While some authors have embraced a genetically highly \\nrestricted concept for C. gloeosporioides, many applied researchers \\ncontinue to use the name in a broad, group-species concept (e.g. \\nBogo et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2012, Kenny et al. 2012, Parvin et \\nal. 2012, and Zhang et al. 2012).
