The authors would like to thank all past and present ICARDA staff associated with the Soil and Plant 
Analysis Laboratory who has contributed to its operation and the development of various procedures. Appreciation is extended to Dr. Abdallah Matar, who put the idea of analysis as a basis for crop production in the region through the medium of the region’s Soil Test Calibration Network. 
The contributions of Dr. Karl Harmsen, the late Dr. Sonia Garabet (formerly of the Soil Analysis 
Laboratory), and the late Mr. Samir Masri (formerly of the Soil Preparation Laboratory), to the authorship of the First Edition of this manual is recognized. The contribution of Dr. Abdul Rashid (Pakistan) is much appreciated, particularly for his valuable input regarding to the two First Editions of this manual. Appreciation is extended to Dr. Theib Oweis, Director of the Integrated Water and 
Land Management Program (IWLMP), for his encouragement and support.  Dr. John Ryan has been involved in the whole endeavor of soil and plant analysis, initially in Morocco as a member of the Soil 
Test Calibration network and later as Soil Fertility Specialist. As much, he was led author of the first two editions of this manual, and co-author of the Third Edition.  
The Soil-Plant Analysis Laboratory has, since ICARDA’s inception, played a vital role in the research activities of the Natural Resource Management Program (NRMP) and indeed throughout the Center. 
The ICARDA management has always supported the Soil-Plant Laboratory; without this support, this manual of adapted soil and plant analysis procedures would not have been published.

Soil is a non-renewable resource upon which mankind depends for survival. Historically, the rise of great civilizations has been linked to the quality of soil and the availability of water. Equally, the demise of such civilizations is often attributed to mismanagement of soil and land in its broadest sense. Crop productivity and soil fertility are thus synonymous.  
In today’s overcrowded world, the challenge to feed and clothe the burgeoning populations of developing countries is a daunting task. Yields have to be increased from existing land areas; adding fertility to the soil to satisfy the demands of higher-yielding crops is essential. Soils vary greatly in their capacity to grow crops without fertilizer; even the richest soils experience declining yields without man’s intervention. In essence, soil is not always a perfect medium for growing plants; it is, however, the only one that is available.  Soils vary greatly throughout the world; they have inherent weakness, primarily deficiencies in nutrients that are essential to growing crops. Even when adequately supplied in the early stages of land cultivation, the nutrient-supplying capacity invariably diminishes with time. Most soils are deficient in nitrogen (N); it is transient in nature, and plants need a lot of it. In many cases, phosphorus (P) is just as critical; soil chemical reactions reduce the effectiveness of P fertilizers. The soils of the West Asia and North Africa (WANA) region are generally well supplied with potassium (K), and usually don’t need fertilization, especially for low-yielding rainfed crops. In recent years, there is a growing realization has grown that other elements, e.g., micronutrients, are deficient in some areas of the region.  As no essential element can substitute for another, it is critically important to identify where and when such deficiencies occur. That’s where the role of soil and plant analysis comes in. Techniques have been developed to evaluate soil fertility constraints based on soil chemical extraction and analysis of the plants that grow on such soils. Both are complementary and, when calibrated with field crop responses to fertilizer, provide a rational basis to identify what elements are missing, and how much fertilizer, whether organic or inorganic, to apply.   Therefore, soil and plant analysis laboratories have a vital role in agricultural development of the WANA region. However, the process does not end there. To be meaningful and valid, tests have to be appropriate for the purpose intended and reliable and repeatable. 
The idea for this soil, plant and water analysis manual grew out of the Soil Test Calibration 
Program within the region’s national agricultural programs that laid the basis for sound fertilizer recommendations. Thus, it was appropriate that ICARDA should address this fundamental issue. If soil and plant tests are not reliable, the process of sampling and analysis is meaningless and undermines the validity of any agronomic trials. This manual is a cornerstone in ICARDA’s soil and water-related research program as well as its training program and is a vital link with agricultural scientists of the ICARDA’s mandate region.  Dr. Mahmoud Solh 
Director General of ICARDA    - 3 - Preface 
This laboratory manual of analytical methods has been compiled to be used primarily by research assistants, technicians and student trainees working in the laboratory. The methods have been selected from different sources and adapted for routine analyses in the WANA region. A detailed description of the methods can be found in the original publications listed in the references. As analytical techniques are developed and improving, this manual will be subject to continuous revision. Any helpful suggestion and feedback from users is most appreciated. 
The idea of having a common laboratory manual for the WANA region was based on the fact that the soils in this arid to semi-arid area have a common suite of properties, leading to similar nutritional problems in crops. Collaborative research in the Soil Test Calibration Network in the 
Mediterranean zone had also revealed that a number of soil tests for assessing nutrient availability have regional applicability (Ryan and Matar, 1990, 1992). In addition, there was hardly any laboratory manual on plant analysis relevant to the crop nutritional problems of the region.  
A common soil, plant, and water analysis manual is also fundamental for success of the WANA soil fertility network. To fill the gap that existed, a comprehensive manual on all essential soil, plant, and water analyses was developed. This manual was designed intentionally in a “cookbook” format, for the ease of laboratory technicians. On completion, the manual draft was reviewed and endorsed at the Soil Fertility Meeting in at Tel Hadya in 1995 (Ryan, 1997).      Subsequently, the First Edition of the manual (Ryan. J, S. Garabet, K. Harmsen, and A. Rashid, “A soil and plant analysis manual adapted for the WANA region”) was published in 1996 by ICARDA, and distributed widely among soil and plant analysis laboratories throughout the region. The response was very encouraging. Most laboratory managers appreciated the initiative, particularly for compiling of all the needed methodologies in a single volume in an easy-to-use format for laboratory technicians.      The Second Edition of the manual (Ryan. J, G. Estefan, and A. Rashid, 2001, “Soil and plant analysis laboratory manual”) had incorporated all the feedback from laboratory managers of the 
WANA region, making the manual more comprehensive, up-to-date, and with minimum technical or typographical errors. We appreciate the constructive criticism and suggestions advanced by the fellow soil scientists for improvement of the manual. The Second Edition was translated and published in Arabic, Russian, and Farsi.     The Third Edition of the manual reflects the changes that have occurred within the past few years in the region, particularly will respect to water and irrigation. While it is still focused on production agriculture, it reflects an increasing concern about environmental pollution, mainly from nitrates, heavy metals, and toxic organic compounds. With greater sophistication in methodologies and equipment, most soil laboratories can now deal with both agricultural and environmental concerns. In addition, improvements have occurred in electronic handling of data and establishing databases. As with the Second Edition, we anticipate translating the Third Edition into Arabic for the 
WANA region in general as well as into French, particularly for North Africa.      We again encourage all the recipients to continue to provide feedback regarding its utility for their particular situations, and indicate errors, if any.

About the authors ............................................................................................................................... 243        - 7 - 1. Introduction 
The idea that one could test or analyze a soil and obtain some information about properties especially its acidity or alkalinity and its nutrient status is long established, and can be traced back to the beginning of scientific inquiry about the nature of soil. Analyses of plants to reflect the fertility status of the soil in which they grew is more recent, although visual crop observations are as old as the ancient Greeks, if not older. In the last few decades, spurred on by commercialization of agriculture and the demands for increased output from limited and even diminishing land resources, both soil and plant analysis procedures have been developed, and are still evolving.  
With the advent of chemical fertilizers, the need to know nutrient status of a soil in order to use such expensive and limited inputs more effectively became all the more crucial. However, if soil testing is to be an effective means of evaluating fertility status of soils, correct methodology is absolutely essential. A soil or a field may be assessed for its capability of providing a crop with essential nutrients in several ways:  1. Field plot fertilizer trials , 2. Greenhouse pot experiments 3. Crop deficiency symptoms 4. Plant analysis 5. Rapid tissue or sap analysis 6. Biological tests 7. Soil testing prior to cropping  
While all these approaches can be used in research, the latter one is most amenable, and one upon which recommendations for farmers can be based. On the other hand, plant analysis is a post-mortem approach and one that should be interpreted in the light of soil test results. 
Soil testing is now an intrinsic part of modern farming in the West, as well as in many developing countries. Tests primarily focus on the elements in most demand by crops which are supplied by fertilizers: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). Depending upon the soil types, in some regions tests are also conducted for secondary nutrients: calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S). In drier areas, micronutrients such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and boron (B) are often measured, since deficiencies of these elements are more frequently associated with calcareous soils. Indeed such areas may also have excessive or toxic levels of some elements, such as B, and high levels of elements such as Na and Mg, which can adversely affect soil physical properties. As nutrient behavior in soils is governed by soil properties and environmental conditions, measurement of such properties is often required. These include pH, salinity, organic matter (OM), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), and texture and aggregate stability. In drier areas, the presence of gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) is also of concern. 
Soil testing involves four distinct phases:  1. Sample Collection: This should be such that it reliably reflects the average status of a field for the parameter considered.  2. Extraction or Digestion and Nutrient Determination: The reagents used and the procedures adopted should extract and reflect all or a portion of the element in the soil which is related to the availability to the plant, i.e., it should be correlated with plant growth. 3. Interpreting the Analytical Results: The units of measurement should reliably indicate if a nutrient is deficient, adequate, or in excess (in some cases toxic to plants).  4. Fertilizer Recommendation: This is based upon the soil test calibrated for field conditions, and considers other factors such as yield target, crop nutrient requirement, management of the crop, soil type, and method of fertilizer application, etc.       - 8 - 
It should be emphasized, however, that a soil test, even if every reliable or accurate, is only one factor in making decisions about the need for fertilization. There are many other factors affecting crop growth and yield, such as soil type and environmental conditions, i.e., moisture and temperature. Because of varying and different forms of nutrients in soils, e.g., calcareous vs. acid soils, soil tests are equally varied, particularly for available P and micronutrients, and to a lesser extent for N (Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Page et al., 1982; Sparks et al., 1966). Being mobile in soils and subject to mineralization-immobilization, N poses particular problems to establish a reliable test. 
Tests for K, pH, OM, and CaCO3 are more straightforward.  
Since the development of the DTPA test of Lindsay and Norvell (1978) and adoption of 
Azomethine-H as a color developing reagent for B (Gaines and Mitchell, 1979), micronutrient tests for alkaline soils (e.g., Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B) have become more valid and therefore more common. 
Though tests for gypsum are developed (Richards 1954; FAO, 1990), there are unique problems for cation exchange capacity (CEC) measurement in such soils (Rhoades and Polemio, 1977). Special mention has to be made of the original USDA Handbook 60, jointly authored by the Staff of the 
Salinity Laboratory in Riverside, California, with Richards (1954) as lead author. Despite its age, this iconic manual is the basis for most analyses of salinity parameters in relation to soils, water and plants, and the ensuing interpretative criteria. Though many methods have been modified, the influence of this manual (“Handbook 60” as it is called) still persists.     The literature on soil testing is rich and varied. Some salient examples include:  Monographs from the American Society of Agronomy for Physical (Klute, 1986) and Chemical Analysis (Page, 1982) which give detailed descriptions of all available soil tests and their modifications. Soil Science Society of America publications (Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Page et al., 1982; Westerman, 1990; Sparks et al., 1996) take a broader look at the philosophy, procedures, and laboratory operations for soil and plant analysis, with interpretation criteria for specific crops. These monographs are regularly updated. The ranges of soil and plant analysis publications include:  1. Soil Testing with a textbook format (Hesse, 1971). 2. University publications that range from those that deal with all soil, water and plant tests (Chapman and Pratt, 1961) to more narrowly based ones (Reisenaur, 1983).  3. Publications that deal with theoretical considerations involved with sampling, correlation, calibration, and interpretation (Brown, 1987).  4. Those that are commercially oriented and reflect “state of the art” instrumentation and computer-assisted data analysis and handling (Jones, 1991; Jones et al., 1991). 5. Finally, publications that are written in “recipe/cook-book” style with little or no discussion; only listed are the equipment and chemicals used and the general steps involved in the procedure (Quick, 1984). 
While most soil testing sources emanate from the West, publications such as those of the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 1970; 1980) are more international in scope and assume a developing-country perspective. In such countries, soil testing is often less developed and, in some cases, does not exist. Similarly, research pertaining to soil testing and plant analysis is often fragmentary and of questionable relevance.  
This leads to a consideration of the West Asia – North Africa (WANA) region, which is served by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA). In this region, the development of the Soil Test Calibration Network at ICARDA served as a catalyst to promote soil testing and thus eventually lead to more efficient use of soil and fertilizer resources in the region. Its evolution and potential impact can be seen from scrutiny of the papers presented at the various workshops, e.g., Aleppo, 1986 (Soltanpour, 1987), Ankara, 1987 (Matar et al., 1988), Amman, 1988 (Ryan and Matar, 1990), and in Agadir, 1991 (Ryan and Matar, 1992), and finally in Aleppo, 1995 (Ryan, 1997).    - 9 - 
Central to the Network, and indeed ICARDA’s operations, has been its Soil, Plant and Water 
Analysis Laboratory. Though its facilities have been designed and developed without some of the constraints experienced by other governmental and educational laboratories in the region, most of the procedures adapted by the laboratory are based on validated regional research.  
A key element in any worthwhile laboratory is a list of appropriate tests presented in such a manner that it can be readily followed routinely by those who actually do soil testing and plant analysis, i.e., the laboratory technicians. Therefore, the target audience for this manual is the cadre of technical staff throughout the region.  
A brief introduction to each test is given so that the technician should have an elementary understanding of the importance of the work he/she is doing. He/she should also know the range of values to be expected for soils and plants in the region, and therefore more readily identify gross errors. We have attempted to select the most appropriate methods for each test and present it in a clear, stepwise manner.  
While the manual primarily deals with soil testing, a number of important plant tests are presented, since they may complement the soil tests and are frequently needed for soil fertility and plant nutrition studies. Similarly, due emphasis has been given to physical properties, describing the tests routinely done along with chemical analysis. The importance of proper soil, plant and water sampling has been highlighted, and guidelines of sample collection, processing, and storage have been provided.  
We have also presented material on laboratory organization and safety aspects, which are often overlooked by technical staff but which impinge greatly on their work output and its reliability. 
Additionally, the Appendices contain useful information on related practiced aspects such as abbreviations, conversion factors, atomic weights, solution concentrations, pH effect on soil conditions, summarized soil test methodologies, plant sampling guidelines, criteria for interpreting soil and plant analysis data, soil salinity, and B toxicity interpretations.       - 10 - 2. Laboratory Facilities, Quality Control and Data Handling 2.1. Laboratory Organization 
Soil, plant, and water analyses are carried out by various institutions in the public or government sector, as well as in the private domain. Laboratories are operated by several entities, including 
Ministries of Agriculture, National Research and Teaching Institutes, International Organizations, and Commercial Companies.  
To be much effective, analytical services should be closely linked to the extension/advisory services and should maintain a functional relationship with the universities and research stations. 
The kind of facility for such analyses depends on the type of institution it serves, the nature of the clientele, and the volume of samples to be analyzed. Nevertheless, all laboratories, regardless of the size, should be designed in a manner to facilitate operational efficiency, minimizes contamination, and produces reliable and repeatable results. 
Various publications deal with management considerations in the design and operation of soil testing (e.g., Walsh and Beaton, 1973). While the advantages of standardized laboratory designs are self-evident, many laboratories in the WANA region have apparent deficiencies in this respect (Ryan, 2000; Ryan et al., 1999). All too often one sees soil samples stored or, worse still, ground in wet chemistry laboratories. Similarly, many laboratories are set up in a manner that inadvertently hinders efficient use of staff resources. 
Soil, plant and water analysis facilities should be located in the same building and be under one unified administration. The Soil, Plant, and Water Analysis Laboratory of ICARDA was designed in the 1980 with these considerations in mind. The various components of the laboratory reflect a logical activity framework. While no two laboratories are ever the same or have the same complement of equipment, the details presented for ICARDA’s laboratory will, hopefully, serve as a general guideline for laboratory arrangement and the type of equipment needed for routine service-oriented operations. 
The Soil, Plant and Water Analysis Laboratory of ICARDA is represented in the following parts: 1. Soil Preparation Room 
Where large bulk samples, transported by truck, are received, dried and sieved. This facility is equipped with a large-capacity oven, freezers, soil grinder, containers and trays, stainless steel soil sieve sets, vacuum pumps, sample dividers, different types of soil sampling (augers, spade, and metal rings), exhaust hood, and a compressed-air machine. Soil samples (~0.5 kg) are dried and placed in clean containers and then transferee to the soil testing laboratory for requested analysis.  2. Soil Store Room 
Where all samples are retained for at least 2 years after analysis; bulk samples of special soil types are kept indefinitely. An inventory or catalogue of all soil samples is maintained.  3. Freezer Room 
In some cases it is necessary to temporarily store large numbers of samples in cold conditions, such as a freezer room, pending analysis; without such conditions, any delay in analysis would result in bacterial changes in soil samples that would invalidate the analytical results.       - 11 - 4. Chemical Analysis Room 
The chemical analysis room is where the sub-sample of dried soil is received in the soil testing laboratory for requested analyses. This facility is normally has various equipment, such as N digestion/distillation, CN-elemental analyzer, flame photometer, spectrophotometer, pH meter, and conductivity meter.  
The more traditional analytical processes of weighing, stirring, shaking, filtering under suction, heating, drying, incubating and centrifuging are done almost exclusively with the aid of electrical machines and devices. In addition, for the digestion and preparation of reagents, chemicals carry out in the Fume Hood. 5. Instrument Room 
This is where soil extraction, where necessary, is carried out for analysis. This facility is normally equipped with various equipment, e.g., atomic absorption spectrophotometer, computer, refrigerator, etc.  6. Physical Analysis Room 
This is where the dried soil sub-samples are received in the soil testing laboratory for requested analyses. This facility is equipped with various equipment, such as pF instrument for field capacity and permanent wilting point, soil dispersing stirrer (a high-speed electric stirrer with a cup receptacle) for particle size distribution, aggregate stability (for wet and dry methods) instruments, balances, permeability apparatus, and water bath. 7. Water Analysis Room 
In this room the more traditional analytical processes are carried out, e.g., pH, electrical conductivity, and anions and cations. General Equipment 
Various items of equipment and associated furnishings are generally found in soil, plant and water analysis laboratories, as indicated as follows:  Laboratory working tables  Appropriate racks  Weighing benches  Cupboards  Laboratory desks and chairs  Fixed suction unit  Fume hood or exhaust systems mounted above the flame photometer, atomic absorption spectrometer, muffle furnace, and Kjeldahl digestion  Washing-sinks for cleaning glassware  Drawing desk facilities for storing standard forms and documentation      - 12 - 2.2. Laboratory Safety 
As with any place of work, safety is an important consideration in soil, plant and water analysis laboratories, and one that is frequently overlooked. A safe working in a chemical laboratory needs special care, both in terms of design and construction of the laboratory building, and handling and use of chemicals. For chemical operations, the release of gases and fumes in some specific analytical operation are controlled through a fume hood or trapped in acidic/alkaline solutions and washed through flowing water. Also, some chemical reactions during the process of analysis, if not handled well, may cause an explosion.  
Analytical processes normally carried out at room temperature can be affected by differences in temperature so that an analysis performed in a “cold” room can give a different result to one performed in a “hot” room. Many chemicals are affected by the temperature and humidity conditions under which they are stored, particularly if these conditions fluctuate. The air temperature of the laboratory and working rooms should ideally be maintained at a constant level (usually between 20 and 25 °C). Humidity should be kept at about 50 %. 
All staff, irrespective of grade, technical skill or employment status, should be briefed on all aspects of safety upon commencement of work. Periodic reminders of such regulations should be given to encourage familiarity with respect to regulations. Ideally, posters relatively to laboratory safely should be prominently displayed in the laboratory. 
While rules pertaining to safety can be extensive, we have endeavored to concisely list the more important ones within different categories of concerns. These have been adapted from laboratory safety guides developed by Kalra and Maynard (1991) and Okalebo et al. (1993). 
General Attitude 1. Develop a positive attitude towards laboratory safety 2. Observe normal laboratory safety practices 3. Maintain a safe and clean work environment 4. Avoid working alone 
Instrument Operation 1. Follow the safety precautions provided by the manufacturer when operating instruments. 2. Monitor instruments while they are operating. 3. Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer must be vented to the atmosphere. Ensure that the drain trap is filled with water prior to igniting the burner. 4. Never open a centrifuge cover until machine has completely stopped. 5. Use of balances:  The warming-up time of the balances is 30 minutes  Spilled chemicals should be removed immediately  Never blow away the spilled product  Brushes are supplied with the balances      - 13 - 
Accidents 1. Learn what to do in case of emergencies (e.g., fire, chemical spill, etc.). Fire-fighting equipment must be readily accessible in the event of fire. Periodic maintenance inspections must be conducted. 2. Learn emergency First Aid, such supplies are a necessity and laboratory staff should be well trained in their use. Replacement of expended supplies must take place in a timely fashion. 3. Seek medical attention immediately if affected by chemicals, and use First Aid until medical aid is available. 4. Access to eye-wash fountains and safety showers must not be locked. Fountains and showers should be checked periodically for proper operation. 
Chemicals 1. Use fume hoods when handling concentrated acids, bases or other hazardous chemicals. 2. Do not pipette by mouth; always use a suction bulb. 3. When diluting, always add acid to water, not water to acid. 4. Some metal salts are extremely toxic and may be fatal if swallowed. Wash hands thoroughly after handling such salts or indeed any chemical regardless of toxicity. Chemical spills should be cleaned promptly and all waste bins emptied regularly. 5. All reagent bottles should be clearly labeled and must include information on any particular hazard. This applies particularly to poisonous, corrosive, and inflammable substances. 6. For the preparation of reagents, only distilled water (DI) is used. Note that volatile acids, ammonia, nitrite, chlorine and carbon dioxide have to be removed by means of a column containing resin (deionizer) which will exchange the charged ions, is needed.  Furnaces, Ovens, Hot Plates  
Use forceps, tongs, or heat-resistant gloves to remove containers from hot plates, ovens or muffle furnaces. Handling Gas 
Cylinders of compressed gases should be secured at all times. A central gas facility is preferred. 
Maintenance 1. All electrical, plumbing, and instrument maintenance work should be done by qualified personnel.  2. Fume hoods should be checked routinely. 3. As most equipment operates on low wattage, an Un-interruptible Power Supply (UPS) provides stable power and allows the completion of any batch measurement in the event of power outage.      - 14 - 
Maintenance of Pipettes 1. At the end of the working day, wash the pipette with tap water and then several times with distilled water.  2. Dry the pipette in an oven. 3. Keep the pipette upside down in a special clamp. 
Eating and Drinking 1. Do not eat or drink in the laboratory. This is essential both for reasons of health, to eliminate any possibly of poisoning, and to reduce contamination. Specific areas should be designated for staff breaks. 2. Do not use laboratory glassware for eating or drinking. 3. Do not store food in the laboratory.  Protective Equipment Body Protection 
Use laboratory coat and chemical-resistant apron. Hand Protection 
Use gloves, particularly when handling concentrated acids, bases, and other hazardous   chemicals. Dust Mask  
A mask is needed when grinding soil, plant samples, etc. Eye Protection 
Use safety glasses with side shields. Contact lenses should never be worn around corrosives. Make sure that your colleagues know if you wear contact lenses.  Full Face Shield  
Wear face shields over safety glasses in experiments involving corrosive chemicals. Foot Protection  
Proper footwear should be used; sandals should not be worn in the laboratory. 
Waste Disposal 1. Liquid wastes should be poured carefully down a sink with sufficient water to dilute and flush it away. Keep in mind that local ordinances often prohibit the disposal of specific substances through the public sewerage system. 2. Dispose-off chipped or broken glassware in specially marked containers. 
Continuing Education  1. Display in a prominent place posters on “Laboratory Safety” which pictorially describe various phases of laboratory activities. 2. Similarly, posters depicting First Aid after laboratories accidents should be prominently displayed. Such posters are not for ornamentation; they are for the protection of laboratory personnel, who should be thoroughly conversant with all procedures and eventualities. 3. If the laboratory is a part of a large institution, the laboratory staff should know the Safety 
Officer or person responsible for safety. If it is a small operation, one laboratory staff member should be responsible for safety.       - 15 - Contamination 
Contamination is a most serious problem in any laboratory; therefore, its sources must be identified and eliminated. Some common sources of contamination are: - External dusts blown from the surrounding environment - Internal dust resulting from cleaning operations - Cross-contamination derived from while handling many samples at the same time (e.g., handling plant and soil samples together) - Failure to store volatile reagents well away from the samples - Washing materials, particularly soap powder - Smoking in the laboratory 
Technical Remarks 1. The air-dry moisture in a soil sample taken straight from a hot and humid storeroom (or a very cold one) may be different from that in a similar sample kept in an air-conditioned laboratory; both may be weighed for analysis at the same time as “air-dry’ samples. 2. The tap water supplied to a laboratory should be entirely free of pollution, as free as possible from insoluble matter, and under good and steady hydrostatic pressure. It may be necessary to filter the supply to certain pieces of equipment.  3. Drainage should be to a main drain if possible or to good-sized “soak-away”. Effluents from soil laboratories contain considerable quantities of waste soil in addition to acid and alkaline liquids. The facilities should be provided in the design of the drainage system for periodic cleaning and removal of solid matter.       - 16 - 2.3. Quality Control and Standardization Procedures 
What follows in this section is a synthesis from the manual of Okalebo et al. (1993). Quality control is an essential part of good laboratory practice. During routine analyses, errors may gradually appear due to contamination, changes in reagent quality, environmental differences, operator error, and instrument calibration or failure. Maximum reproducibility and adequate accuracy of results are the important objectives.  
Repeated measurement of an air-dried soil sample should provide consistent results when analyzed over time for most routine chemical procedures. The deviation of an observed value from its absolute “true” value results from either systematic or random errors. Once identified, systematic errors are more easily corrected than those which occur at random. Three precautions are essential for laboratory quality control and should be routinely included among the test samples. These precautions involve the use of blanks, repeats, and internal references, as elaborated below. 
Whenever a new procedure is introduced to the laboratory, its accuracy should be evaluated and compared to the test already in use. Both methods should be compared for a homogeneous test sample using ten-fold replicates, with the standard deviation calculated for each set. This provides a measure of precision. Known amounts of reagent should be added to the homogeneous test sample, the procedures repeated, and the mean and standard then deviation calculated. The agreement between the increases in the values obtained to the known increase in test sample concentration provides a test of accuracy. For procedures in which the test material is known to interact with the added reagent, as with phosphorus-sorptive soils, this test can be conducted by reagent solutions. Blanks 
Blanks are reaction vessels that are subjected to identical procedures as the sample in a given batch which has no added test material. Blanks allow correction for any background contamination introduced from reagents, filter papers or other systemic sources of error. Provided the blank values are consistent, the mean value can be subtracted from the sample value. When blanks yield large values, this suggests excess extraneous contamination; in such cases, the entire batch analysis be repeated. Repeats 
At least 1 in 10 samples selected from the test materials and placed at random within the batch should be analyzed in duplicate. The choice of 1 in 10 is a suggested compromise between the ideal of analyzing all samples in duplicate, considering the time, effort and expense of doing so. Obviously, the analytical results for given pairs of duplicate repeats should closely resemble one another, in general, repeat values should fall within ±2.5 – 5.0 % of their mean, depending on the analysis in question; any greater discrepancy must be investigated. If repeat values are not consistent, the entire batch should be re-analyzed.      - 17 - Internal References 
Internal reference samples are necessary for each type of test material and analysis practiced within the laboratory. The internal sample should not be the same as the homogeneous material routinely used in the testing new methods and analytical technique. A sample obtained from a large, well mixed and homogeneous composite bulk sample should be included in each batch analyzed. 
Variation from the mean as calculated over previous batches may be indicated as an error. 
Analytical results for the internal reference may be plotted on a quality control chart to monitor the performance of the analyses over time. Corrective action could be taken if a single value exceeds the ± 3 standard deviation limits or if two successive values exceed the ± 2 standard deviations. 
Periodically, the critical limits could be re-assessed by re-calculation of the overall standard deviation of the internal reference sample as more data are accumulated. Standardization of Methods 
Results can only be validly compared to one another when they have been obtained using standardized methods. Collaboration between laboratories can be improved by exchanging reference materials and then comparing their results (Ryan and Garabet, 1994). Such materials are referred as “External References”. An example of such standardization is the exchange network of ISRIC (International Soil Reference and Information Center) in Wageningen, The Netherlands, and operating international soil and plant analytical exchange programs. 
Most external reference samples are costly, and their frequent use increases operating costs of the laboratory. Internal reference samples are usually much less expensive. Thus, if a relationship between external and internal reference samples can be firmly established, frequent use of internal reference sample, with occasional use of the external reference sample, can reduce costs, while still providing acceptable quality assurance.      - 18 - 
Errors in Quantitative Analysis 
In dealing with analysis, the concepts of accuracy and precision (See Figure.1) are important. 
Accuracy: A measure of systematic error or the degree of agreement of an experimental value with the true or expected value of the quantity of concern. Accuracy of the value is important, but it is important to know when to use a given analytical method and to know its limitations.                                                                                           
Precision: A measure of reproducibility affected by random error. It is usually described by the standard deviation, standard error, or confidence interval.                                         Figure. 1  Illustration of Accuracy and Precision    - 19 - 2.4. Data Processing 
A considerable amount of information is generated in any soil, plant, and water analysis laboratory. 
In order to economically justify the existence of a laboratory, it is necessary to have a record of the number of samples analyzed and the types of analyses performed. With the advent of the computer, such storage is easy and retrieval is greatly facilitated. 
Computer processing offers the advantage of:   - Easier manipulation of large data sets, - Reduced errors in calculation of recommendations, - Preparation of reports, - Automated invoicing and addressing, and  - Ready access to historical data for preparation of soil test summaries.  
The degree to which laboratories should be computerized depends on sample volume, location and user services offered. In general, laboratories with a large volume of samples, and which offer a range of analyses, have more need for computer sophistication and automation than laboratories with a small sample turn-over. 
In order to facilitate data processing, standard information sheets are required. These vary from laboratory to laboratory, but usually include details of analyses required for the sample and information on the crop to be grown, the soil type, and previous cropping history, particularly with respect to fertilization. Such information enables one to answer questions on the extent of nutrient deficiency in any area from which the samples were obtained, and how fertility levels change over the years. 
Computer programs are increasingly used to interpret soil test data and making fertilizer recommendations. Several such programs do exist. Standardized report forms for making fertilizer recommendations combine inputs of soil test data together with other soil and crop information. In order to do this, the tests used (soil NO3-N, available P, etc.) must be calibrated with field crop response. 
With a relatively large output of analyses associated with a large number of on-station and on farm research trials, analytical results from ICARDA’s laboratory are stored in a computer program to generate fertilizer recommendations based on soil test values. Where soil maps and rainfall data are available, the accumulated soil test values of known locations can help establish relationships with soil type, region, and climatic zone.      - 20 - 3. Soil Sampling and Processing 
While the main focus of this manual is to present an easy-to-use methodology for soil testing and, to a lesser extent, for plant analysis, their related aspects are worthy of due emphasis. Therefore, a brief description of such aspects follows. 
While much attention is given to laboratory procedures, the process of obtaining soil for analysis, i.e., soil sampling, is often ignored or poorly considered. A good sampling plan should provide a measure of the average fertility level of a field and a measure of how variable it is. If a sample is not representative of the field or is incorrectly taken, the resulting analytical data are meaningless, or at best, difficult to interpret. The error in field sampling is generally much greater than that due to chemical analysis. Therefore, obtaining a representative soil sample from a field is the most important step for making a meaningful soil analysis. 3.1. Soil Sampling 
A soil sample should be composed of several sub-samples representing a seemingly uniform area or field with similar cropping and management history. There is no universally accepted numbers of sub-samples for different field situations. However, the following points can serve as guidelines: 
Composite Sampling   At ICARDA, eight sub-samples are taken per hectare (ha) in a diagonal pattern for obtaining one composite sample.  Other plans range from 5 to 25 borings or sub-samples per composite sample, with sample units varying from 2 to 8 ha.  Fewer sub-samples are needed where little or no fertilizer has been used. Sampling areas are often traversed in a zigzag pattern to provide a uniform distribution of sampling sites. Some of these methods are represented in Figure 2 and 3.  Correspondingly, more sub-samples are needed where fertility is variable due to hand broadcasting of fertilizers and/or with cropping-livestock systems. Indeed, banding of fertilizer poses serious problems for reliable sampling.  Thus, the number of sub-samples taken by farmers should be realistic, considering the particular field situation.    - 21 -

Sampling Time  Soil samples can be taken any time that soil conditions permit, but sampling directly after fertilization or amendment application should be avoided.   Samples taken during the crop growth period will help in knowing the nutrient status of the soil in which plants are actively taking up nutrients.   In the WANA region, it is recommended that sampling be carried out in autumn (before planting) if fertilization is intended at planting.  It is important to sample at similar times year after year for comparing analysis at regular time intervals. 
Sampling Depth   For most purposes, soil sampling is done to a depth of about 20-cm. Available P, NO3-N, and micronutrients in such samples are related to crop growth, and nutrient uptake.   In some cases, especially in irrigated areas, sampling to a depth of 60-100 cm is desirable, especially for monitoring nitrate (NO3-N) leaching.  Depth-wise soil samples should also be taken where there is a concern about B toxicity. 
Sampling Tools   A uniform slice should be taken from the surface to the depth of insertion of the tool; the same volume of soil should be obtained in each sub-sample.   Augers generally meet these requirements. In areas where the topsoil is dry, e.g., during summer, topsoil sampling can be done by a metal ring, by digging out the soil inside the ring, because it is almost impossible to sample dry topsoil with an auger.  Soil samples for micronutrient analysis should be taken using a stainless steel auger, or at least ungalvanized auger (because galvanized coating is zinc oxide).  Researchers generally use augers for field sampling. Farmers or Extension Agents can use shovels or trowels, with almost the same result.  If you do not have sampling tools, use a spade as follows: - Dig a V-shaped hole 15 to 20 cm deep. Then take a fine thick slice from the smooth side (see 
Figure 4). - Trim the sides leaving a fine strip then dump this strip into a clean bucket. Break the clods, and mix thoroughly. Remove large rocks, pieces of sod, earthworms, etc. Put the soil into the sample container and label the box clearly.  For a moist soil, the tube auger or spade is considered satisfactory. For harder soil, a screw auger may be more convenient.   Soil profile

Instructions for Field Processing   Disturbed soil samples should be put in plastic bags (tags and markers are required), or aluminum or stainless steel boxes  Depending on the subsequent analysis samples may be kept cool until laboratory analysis.   Bags should be examined for cleanliness as well as for strength.  Soil samples can be transported to the laboratory in cardboard boxes or sacks.   All information about samples is recorded, and each sample is given a laboratory number.  Sketch your field. Diagram it the way you sampled it. Be sure sampled areas are labeled the same as sample containers. (This is so you have a record of which recommendations apply to which areas – do not rely on your memory).  Information sheet should be clearly written with copying pencil. Fill out the information sheets. The more information you can provide with each sample, the better your recommendation will be.  Do not sample unusual area, like unevenly fertilized, old channel, old bunds, area near the tree, and site of previous compost piles and other unrepresentative sites.  Avoid any type of contamination at all stages. Soil samples should never be kept in the store along with fertilizer materials and detergents. Contamination is likely when the soil samples are spread out to dry in the vicinity of stored fertilizers or on floor where fertilizers were stored previously.  Collect samples from the middle of the rows, when crops have been planted in rows, so as to avoid the area where fertilizer has been band-placed.    
Figure 4. Soil sampling tool: Spade    - 24 - 3.2. Preparation Laboratory Processing  
Handling in the laboratory  As soon as the samples are received at the soil preparation facility, they should be checked with the accompanying information list (including sample number, depth, and date of sampling should be written on the bag from outside, and on a sample card placed inside the bag). Information regarding samples should be entered in a register and each sample be given a laboratory number.  The soil-fresh sample received in the laboratory should be analyzed directly after sampling for determination of nitrate, nitrite and ammonium. These samples should not be dried, and the results are expressed on oven-dry basis by separately estimating moisture content in the samples. If short-term storage is unavoidable, this must be done in a fridge at temperature close to 0 °C (but not below zero!). Lag time between field sampling and analysis must be minimized. Otherwise, storage time will inevitably introduce an additional factor influencing analysis results. 
Drying of the soil samples  The soil-fresh samples received in the laboratory should be dried in wooden or enameled trays. 
The trays can be numbered or a plastic tag could be attached, and care should be taken to maintain the identity of each sample at all stages of preparation.   During drying, the soils are allowed to dry in the air. Alternatively, the trays may be placed in racks in a hot air cabinet (the temperature should not exceed 35 °C and humidity should be between 30 and 60 %). In general, excessive oven-drying of the soil affects the availability of most of the nutrients present in the sample, and should be avoided.   Only air-drying is recommended for some of the nutrients present in the sample. Such as, drying has negligible effect on total N content but the NH4 and NO3 content in the soil changes with time and temperature. The microbial biomass is also significantly affected by drying at high temperature.  
Preparation of soil samples   After drying, the samples are ground with a wooden pestle and mortar in preparation room (which is separate from the main laboratory), and clods and large aggregates are crushed and mixed. Remember that:  Pebbles, concretions, and stones should not be broken during grinding.  Care should be taken not to break the individual soil particles during the grinding process.  The entire sample should be passed through the sieve, except for concretions and pebbles of more than 2-mm.  The purpose of grinding is to reduce heterogeneity and to provide maximum surface area for physical and chemical reactions. Various devices are used for crushing and grinding soils. 
However, choice of equipment depends on: -  Amount of sample to be crushed or ground -    Contamination that can be tolerated -  Degree of fineness to be attained  -    The analysis in question  
Ovens    - 25 -  After grinding, the soil is screened through a 2-mm sieve. The coarse portion on the sieve should be returned to the mortar for further grinding (except for concretions, pebbles, and organic residues). Repeat sieving and grinding till all aggregate particles are fine enough to pass the 2-mm sieve.   It is necessary to reduce the size of the large sample for ease of storage and handling. To achieve this goal, a random method of sub-sampling is essential. Sample splitting can be performed with a mechanical sample splitter, such as a Riffle-type Sample Splitter, by which the sample is divided in half by a series of chutes. This process can be repeated as many times as necessary.   Another way for reduction of sample size is by quartering. The sample is spread uniformly over a plastic or paper sheet and divided into four equal portions. For example, portions 2 and 3 are collected and thoroughly mixed, whereas the remainder is discarded.  Following the drying and preparing processes, half of the amounts of the dried soil sub sample are placed in a clean container and then transferee into the soil testing laboratory for the requested analysis, the rest should be stored in cardboard boxes in a store room.  Remember, if the soil is to be analyzed for trace elements, containers made of copper (Cu), zinc (Zn) and brass must be avoided during grinding and handling. Sieves of different sizes can be obtained in stainless steel. Aluminum or plastic sieves are useful alternative for general purposes.

Reduction of soil sample size    - 26 - 4. Soil Physical Analysis 
Soil physical measurements are numerous, depending on the objective of the study for agricultural purposes. These measurements generally includes soil water purpose on the content, infiltration and hydraulic conductivity, evapotranspiration, heat, temperature, reflectivity, porosity, particle size, bulk density, aggregate stability, and particle size distribution.  
Soil moisture is routinely measured on field-moist samples, since all physical analyses are expressed on oven-dry basis (16-18 hours drying at 105 oC). As texture (e.g., whether sandy or clay) is quite important in relation to nutrient behavior, particle size distribution is often carried out, especially if more precision is needed than provided by the qualitative physical “feel” approach for determining texture. 4.1. Soil Moisture Content 
As water is the most limiting factor in the arid to semi-arid areas, soil moisture determination is of major significance. Soil moisture influences crop growth not only by affecting nutrient availability, but also nutrient transformations and soil biological behavior. Therefore, at ICARDA soil moisture is routinely measured in most field trials. While it can be assessed in the field by the neutron probe, the gravimetric approach is more flexible, as samples can be readily taken from any soil situation. All analyses in the laboratory are related to an air- or oven-dry basis, and therefore must consider the actual soil moisture content (Sparks et al., 1966). Apparatus 
Electric oven with thermostat  Desiccator 
Procedure 1. Weigh 10 g air-dry soil (< 2-mm) into a previously dried (105 °C) and weighed metal can with lid. 2. Dry in an oven, with the lid unfitted, at 105 °C overnight (normally for 24 hours). 3. Next day, when the soil has dried, remove the container from the oven, using tongs; fit the lid, cool in a desiccator for at least 30 minutes and re-weigh. 
Calculation                                                                                                                                                       - 27 - 
Technical Remarks 1. The wet soil sample should be kept loosely in the container. 2. Care should be taken to avoid over-heating of the soil sample by maintaining the oven temperature at 105-110 °C. 3. Dry soil sample should not be left uncovered before weighing. 4. To determine the moisture content of litter and humus samples, dry samples at 70 °C for 48 h.  5. Moisture content in air-dry is called hygroscopic moisture. It varies from less than 0.2% for sand to more than 8% for similar with leaf litter/OM, depending upon the relative humidity in the storage area, and fineness of soil particles. Samples should be air-dried prior to moisture content determination. 6. Moisture content values reproducible to within ± 0.5 % can be achieved. 7. The oven is monitored periodically to ensure that temperature fluctuation does not exceed 5 oC. 8. The water content at field capacity, wilting point, and the hygroscopic coefficient are all based on the oven-dry reference mass. The percentage of water held under each of these conditions can therefore be used to define the following and other forms of soil water. Each of these forms of water can be calculated from the appropriate soil mass.                                                  
Capillary water (%) = Field capacity - Hygroscopic coefficient  
Available water (%) = Field capacity – Wilting point  
Unavailable water (%) = Wilting point  
Gravitational water (%) = Water content – Field capacity       - 28 - 4.2. Water Holding Capacity  
The water-holding capacity (WHC) is defined as the amount of water held in the soil after the excess gravitational water has drained away and after the rate of downward movement of water has materially ceased. Stage of field capacity is attained in the field after 24 to 72 hours of saturation; this is the upper limit of plant-available soil moisture. We must distinguish between soil water content, (the percent water on an oven-dry weight basis), and the soil water potential (the energy status of water in the soil), which is usually expressed in pressure units (Pascal or bar). However, as indeed we are dealing with a tension – a negative pressure - units are usually considered to be negative.

A. Field Processing 1. Select a uniform plot measuring (5 m x 5 m) and make a flat and horizontal area. 2. Remove any loose material from the surface (weeds, pebbles, etc.). 3. Make bunds around the plot. 4. Fill sufficient water in the plot to completely saturate the soil. 5. Cover the plot area with a polythene sheet to check evaporation. 6. Take soil sample from the centre of the plot from the desired layer, starting after 24 h of saturation and determine moisture content daily till the values of successive days are nearly equal. 7. Record the weight of the oven-dry soil.  8. Repeat above on next day and so on till a constant oven-dry soil value is reached.      - 29 - 
B. Laboratory Processing 1. Thoroughly air-dry compost and soil samples. 2. Attach and clamp tubing to bottom of funnel and attach funnel to ring stand. 3. Place filter paper in funnel. 4. Fill funnel with the 100 mL sample – do not compact. 5. Measure out 100 mL of water using the graduated cylinder. 6. Gradually add water to the sample until covered. Record the amount of water added. 7. Stir gently and let sit until sample is fully saturated. 8. Release the clamp and collect excess water in the graduated cylinder (water drained, mL). 9. Record the amount of water in the cylinder. 10. Calculate how much water was retained in the 100-mL sample of compost, soil or compost/ soil mixture and then calculate the water-holding capacity. 
Calculations                                                    –                                                                                          Note 
Water-holding capacity is expressed as the amount of water retained per liter of soil, so the next step is to multiply by 10 to convert from the 100 mL sample to the full liter. 
Technical Remarks 1. Estimates of soil WHC, wilting point and texture can be made from the saturated moisture content. The method is generally reproducible within ± 12%, dependent on the soil textural class.  2. Plot the daily readings on a graph paper. The lowest reading is taken as the value of field capacity of the soil.        - 30 - 4.3. Particle Size Distribution 
Individual soil particles vary widely in any soil type. Similarly, as these particles are cemented together, a variety of aggregate shapes and sizes occur. For standard particle size measurement, the soil fraction that passes a 2-mm sieve is considered. Laboratory procedures normally estimate percentage of sand (0.05 – 2.0 mm), silt (0.002 – 0.05 mm), and clay (<0.002 mm) fractions in soils.  
Particle size distribution is an important parameter in soil classification and has implications for soil water, aeration, and nutrient availability to plants. Also, soil texture is an important property for agricultural soil, road beds, septic disposal systems, influences fertility, drainage, water-holding capacity, aeration, tillage, and bearing strength of soils. Because texture is so important, it is a standard physical soil test.  
As primary soil particles are usually cemented together by organic matter, this has to be removed by hydroxide peroxide (H2O2) treatment. However, if substantial amounts of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are present, actual percentages of sand, silt or clay can only be determined by prior dissolution of the CaCO3. The two common procedures used for particle size analysis or mechanical analysis are the hydrometer method or the pipette-gravimetric method. 4.4. Hydrometer Method  
The hydrometer method of silt and clay measurement relies in the effect of particle size on the differential settling velocities within a water column. By this method (using Hydrometer with 
Bouyoucos scale in g/L) after 40 second all sand-sized particles (0.02 mm and larger) settle out of the suspension and after 4 h, particles larger than clay (0.002 mm) settle out of the suspension. 
Theoretically, the particles are assumed to be spherical having a specific density of 2.65 g/cm3. If all other factors are constant, then the settling velocity is proportional to the square of the radius of the particle (Stoke’s Law).                            Where:  
V = Velocity of fall (cm/sec) r = "equivalent" radius of the particle (cm) ρdp = Density of particle (g/cm3), 2.65 is a (usual) good approximation ρdl = Density of liquid (g/cm3), for water this is ~1.0 g= Acceleration of gravity (cm/sec), value at the sea level is 981  η= Viscosity of liquid (g/cm/sec) 
In practice, the density of water and its viscosity are both affected by temperature. Therefore, we must know and make corrections for the temperature of the liquid. Greater temperatures result in reduced viscosity due to liquid expansion and a more rapid descent of falling particles.

Technical Remarks 1. If possible, all hydrometer jars should be placed in a water bath at constant temperature (20 °C); in that case, temperature corrections are not needed. 2. For temperature correction, use a value of 0.4 for each degree temperature difference from 20 °C. Add or subtract this factor if the temperature is more or less than 20 °C, respectively. 3. All results of mechanical analysis should be expressed on the basis of oven-dry soil (16-24 hours drying at 105 °C). 4. In the above procedure, carbonates and organic matter are not removed from the soil. 5. The Hydrometer method, as described in this section, cannot be applied to soils that contain free gypsum (gypsiferous soils). For gypsiferous soils, see Hesse (1971). 6. Sum of silt and clay + sand should be 100 %. The magnitude of deviation from 100 is an indication for the degree in accuracy.  7. The material not passing the sieve is weighed and reported as percentage of the air-dry weight of the whole sample. 8. Dispersion is achieved by mechanical means (stirring for larger aggregates), by chemical dispersion using sodium hexametaphosphate, and by eliminating cementing agents such as organic matter (oxidized with hydrogen peroxide) and calcium carbonate (dissolved with hydrochloric acid). 9. Sodium hexametaphosphate is an effective dispersing agent for two reasons:   The sodium monovalent cation replaces polyvalent cations (predominantly calcium) usually adsorbed on soil colloids, thereby breaking one type of inter-particle linkage. The polyvalent cations are then reduced in activity by reacting with the phosphate and precipitating.   The adsorbed sodium cations are highly hydrated and raise the electro-negativity of the colloids until these particles repel each other and remain dispersed. The mixture of dispersed soil particles in water is called a soil suspension.     - 34 - Soil Texture 
Once the percentage of sand, silt, and clay is measured, the soil may be assigned a textural class using the USDA textural triangle. Within the textural triangle are various soil textures which depend on the relative proportions of the soil fractions. Twelve soil textural classes are recognized and their compositions are designed on a textural triangle. The class name can be determined by plotting these values on a textural triangle using the following technique: 1. Clay; extend line horizontal from the percent clay (parallel with base of triangle, sand). 2. Silt; extend line downward from percent silt at 60° (parallel with right side of triangle, clay). 3. Sand; extend line upward from percent sand at 120° (parallel with left site of triangle, silt).  
For example, if a soil is 50 % sand, 35 % silt, and 25 % clay, the texture is sandy clay loam (see Figure. 5).    
Figure 5. USDA soil textural triangle; indicated example, sandy clay loam: 50 % sand, 35 % silt, and 25 % clay        - 35 - 4.4.1. Pipette Method  
The pipette is a laboratory instrument used to transport a measured volume of suspension. 
Therefore, the pipette method is based on the difference in sedimentation velocity between large and small soil particles. The sedimentation of the particles is the result of two opposite forces, i.e., gravity and friction as a result of movement in a liquid medium. In the pipetting method, a sample is pipette from a suspension in a graduated measuring cylinder at various times and depths. Times and depths are determined with Stokes’ law. The pipetted suspension is evaporated down and dehydrated, and the mass percentage of the pipetted fraction is determined by weighing. Apparatus 
Cylinders (1000-mL) provided with rubber stoppers 
Soil dispersing stirrer: a high-speed electric stirrer with a cup receptacle 
Water bath        Pipette apparatus consists of: - Frame with a runner with pipette holder fixed on top of it. - Pipette balloon. - Glass tank (113 L capacity). - Heating element with thermostat and stirring device. Reagents A. Amyl Alcohol 
B. Deionized or distilled water  C. Dispersing Solution 
Dissolve 40 g sodium hexametaphosphate [(NaPO3)13], and 10 g sodium carbonate (Na2CO3) in DI water, and bring to 1-L volume with DI water. This solution deteriorates with time and should not be kept for more than 1 to 2 weeks.  Procedure 
A. Pre-treatment 1. Each sample is given a laboratory number. 2. The sample is spread uniformly over a plastic or paper sheet, let them air dry.  3. Remove any straw, roots, dead leaves and large stones. 4. Prepare the subsamples by ‘quartering’. The mixed soil material is coned in the center of the mixing sheet with care to make it symmetrical with respect to fine and coarse soil material. 5. Calculate the oven dry weight of the soil sub-sample (soil moisture content).   
B. Sand fraction determination 1. The pretreated soil suspension is passed through the appropriate sized sieve (usually 200 µm sieve). Therefore, the soil should be crushed by pestle and porcelain mortar and pass through 200 µm sieve. 2. Repeat until 20% of the soil is retained on the top of the 200 µm sieve. 3. The sand fraction is washed, and quantitatively transfer the sediment suspension through a 270 mesh (53 um) sieve and wash with DI water using a wash bottle. Transfer the sand to a tare beaker, dry at 105 oC and weigh. The dried sand may be placed in nested sieves to determine individual sand fraction size analysis.    - 36 - 
C. Silt and clay determination 1. Weigh 40 g air-dry soil (2-mm) into a 600-mL beaker. 2. Add 60-mL dispersing solution. 3. Cover the beaker with a watch-glass, and leave overnight. 4. Next day, quantitatively transfer contents of the beaker to a soil stirring cup, and fill the cup to about three quarters with water using a soil stirring device, stir suspension at high speed for 2 minutes. 5. Transfer suspension quantitatively into a 1-L calibrated cylinder (hydrometer jar), and bring to volume with water. 6. Place the volumetric cylinders in the large temperature-controlled water bath (should be placed on a vibration-free table). The temperature of the water of the controlled water bath must be kept as constant as possible with the aid of the heating element with thermostat and stirring element. 7. Place the stirring paddle in the volumetric cylinder. Shake up-down and mix the suspension intensively for 20 times. Remove stirring paddle and wait until the swirling motion of the practices has just given way to steady settling under gravity. 8. Start the timer or stop-watch. Leave this to settle for 4 hours.   Note 
The suspension must be complete, since/ otherwise particles could inter-aggregate. One indication of incomplete suspension is the forming of stratification of the suspension in the measuring cylinder. 9. About 30 seconds before the appropriate sampling time, lower the pipette (previously fixed above the centre of the cylinder) slowly until the tip just touches the surface of the suspension. Note the vertical scale reading and then lower the pipette to the required depth. 
Calibrated and fill the pipette by gentle and steady suction (capacity of the pipette around 20 mL (see below the using of the calibrated pipette).  10. Remove the pipette from the suspension. Transfer the aliquot to an evaporating dish and wash the pipette twice with water, adding the washing to the dish.  11. Dry the evaporating dishes with the suspension (evaporated down). 12. Determine the mass percentage of the pipette fraction by weighing. 13. Decant the cylinder sediments and suspension into analytical sieves to calculate the sand fractions. 14. Repeat the sampling a second time after remixing the suspension with the stirring paddle. 15. Evaporate to dryness on a water bath, dry the residue in an oven at 105 oC for 16-18 h, cool in desiccators and weigh to the nearest 0.2 mg.      - 37 - Technical Remarks 
Using of the calibrated pipette 1. Make sure that the two-way cock (K1) and the cock (K3) of the pipette are closed, and the two-way cock (K2) of the pipette (P) is opened toward the pipette before you place the pipette (see sketch of pipette) over the measuring cylinder with the suspension, 30 second before pipetting (see Figure.6). 2. Insert the pipette into the suspension at the required depth (lower the pipette slowly to avoid disturbance). 3. Connect exhaust point (A) to the pipette balloon. 4. Open the two-way cock (K1) and steadily draw the pipette full until the liquid level is above two-way cock (K2). 5. Close the two-way cocks (K1) and (K2). 6. Move the runner to the right (outside the glass tank). 7. Open two-way cock (K2) above drain (D) to drain off any excess suspension. 8. Rinse overflow ball (F) with water from storage ball (W) by opening cock (K3). 9. Open the two-way cock (K2) above pipette (P). 10. Open two-way cock (K1) above drain (E) and empty the pipette in an evaporating dish. 11. Rinse the pipette (P) with water from the storage ball (W). Collect also this scouring water in the same evaporating dish. 12. Open two-way cock (K1) above pipette point (S) and remove the pipette from the suspension. 13. Collect the suspension of the pipette in evaporating dish. 
Determination of the in-feed depth of the pipette 1. Determine the temperature of the blank and read the in-feed depth of the pipette and the sedimentation time of the desired fraction from the table below. 2. Mix the suspension intensively for at least 1 minute and start the chronometer. Pipette (after the prescribed sedimentation time) the particles ≤ 2 μm to determine the lutum content (lower the pipette slowly to avoid disturbance).  3. To determine the particle-size distribution, first pipette the fraction smaller than or equal to 35 μm, and subsequently the other desired fractions in descending order according to particle size.

Calculation the depth of pipette sampling 
The depth of pipette sampling is based on the velocity (Stokes’ Law). The re-arranged equation is:                                Where:  
T = Time of pipetting  h = Depth of pipette V = Velocity of fall (cm/sec) 
Ρdp= Density of particle (g/cm3) ρdl = Density of liquid (g/cm3), for water this is ~1.0 g= Acceleration of gravity (cm/sec), value at the sea level is 981  η= Viscosity of liquid (g/cm/sec) 
X2= Particles diameter         - 39 - 
Assumptions used in applying Stokes’ Law to soil sedimentation measurements are as follows: 1. Terminal velocity is attained as soon as settling begins. 2. Settling and resistance are entirely due to the viscosity of the fluid. 3. Particles are smooth and spherical. 4. There is no interaction between individual particles in the solution. 5. It is recommended to use horizontal reciprocating to disperse the samples. The use of electric stirrer at high revolutions per minute (rpm) may result in significant grinding of sample primary minerals. 6. For soils having clay particle densities <2.65 g/cm3, settling time increases, and for soils >2.65 g/cm3, settling time decreases. 7. An error of 0.001 ± g in the dry weight of the pipette sample results in an error of ± 0.32 % for clay size fraction. 8. Since soil particles are not smooth and spherical, the radius of the particle is considered an equivalent rather than an actual radius. In this method, particle density is assumed to be 2.65 (g/cm3) and density of liquid is assumed to be 1 (g/cm3). 9. Water density and viscosity at different temperatures. Temperature ( o

Soil structure is defined as the arrangement of the soil particles. With regard to structure, soil particles refer not only to sand, silt and clay but also to the aggregate or structural elements, which have been formed by the aggregation of smaller mechanical fractions. The size, shape and character of the soil structure varies, which could be cube, prism and platter likes. On the basis of size, the soil structure is classified as follows: very coarse (>10 mm), coarse (5-10 mm); medium (2-5 mm); fine (1-2 mm); and very fine (<1 mm). Depending upon the stability of the aggregate and the ease of separation, the structure is characterized as follows: Poorly developed, weekly developed, moderately developed, well developed, and highly developed. 4.5.1. Dry Aggregate Analysis  
An aggregate analysis aims to measure the percentage of water-stable secondary particles in the soil and the extent to which the finer mechanical separates are aggregated into coarser or larger fractions. The resulting aggregate-size distribution depends on the manner and condition in which the disintegration is brought about. For the measurements to have practical significance, the disruptive forces causing disintegration should closely compare with the forces expected in the field. 
The field condition, particularly with respect to soil moisture, should be compared with the moisture condition adopted for soil disintegration in the laboratory. The sampling of soil and subsequent disintegration of clods in relevance to seed bed preparation for upland crops should be carried out under air dry conditions for dry sieve analysis. A rotary sieve shaker would be ideal for dry sieving. Apparatus

Calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil sub-sample (soil moisture content).  4. Weigh the soil subsamples to the nearest 0.1 g.  5. Prepare the sieving tower and stack sieves starting with the smallest sieve opening, and add a pan at the bottom of the set. Note 
To avoid leakage, make sure that the O-rings are placed between individual sieves, the bottom sieve and the sieve pan, and the top sieve and the clamping lid. 6. Gently pour the soil aggregates collected on the top of the nest of sieves (having different diameter round openings usually 5.0, 2.0, 1.0, 0.5 and 0.25 mm)  7. Cover the top sieve with the lid and place the nest of sieves on a rotary shaker.  8. Switch on the shaker for 10 minutes, remove the sieves, collect the soil retained on each sieve in the pre-weighed aluminum cans, with the help of a small brush, and weigh the cans with the soil. 9. Analyze the duplicate sample following the same procedure and calculate the percent distribution of dry aggregates retained on each sieve.      - 42 -

Switch on the motor for 10 minutes and proceed (as above Steps 5, 6, 7) for the estimation of aggregate size distribution.  2. Use work gloves to protect hands, and a mask and other personal protective equipment to protect from dust.  3. The fume hood is the best place to use the rotary sieve shaker. 4. The number and sizes of aggregate-size classes collected depends on the objective of the experiment.       - 43 - 4.5.2. Wet Aggregate Analysis  
The soil sample is taken when it is moist and friable. It is broken by applying mild stress into smaller aggregates which can pass through 8-mm screen. The sieved soil sample is taken on a watch glass for wetting by either vacuum soaking or immersion method. Aggregates of different sizes can be obtained through several methods such as, samples under vacuum and sieving under water. Among the different procedures adopted, wetting the samples under vacuum is suggested because the rate of wetting influences slaking of crumbs. The time of sieving ranges from 10 to 30 minutes depending upon the type of wetting. However, sieving under water compares more closely with the disruptive actions of water and other mechanical forces. Apparatus

B. Laboratory processing 1. Each sample is given a laboratory number. 2. Spread the samples uniformly over a plastic or paper sheet to air-dry. Field-moist instead of air-dry samples may be used, if air-drying is assumed to affect aggregates (“self-mulching soils”). Prepare the subsamples by ‘quartering’. The mixed soil material is coned in the center of the mixing sheet with care to make it symmetrical with respect to fine and coarse soil material. 3. Calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil sub-sample (soil moisture content).  4. Weigh 50 g air-dry soil (<2-mm). 5. Gently pour the soil aggregates collected into standard metal ring (place under the metal ring a filter paper and a small plastic dish). 6. Add 50 mL tap water (allowing the water to soak up underneath) to saturate the soil sample. 
Leave the wetted soil samples for 30 minutes. 7. Transfer the set saturated soil sample into the 2 sieves 0.5 mm (above) and 0.2 mm (bottom). Add any larger size sieve above the first sieve to reach the limit of the surface water in the tank.  8. Remove the bottom pan, and attach the nest of sieves to the Yoder-type wet sieve shaker. 9. Fill the drum (which holds the set of sieves) with salt-free water at 20-25 0C to a level somewhat below that of the screen in the top sieve of the nest of sieves, when the sieves are in the highest position. Then lower the sieves-nest to wet the soil for 10 minutes.  10. Bring the nest of sieves to the initial position and adjust the level of water so that the screen in the top sieve is covered with water in its highest position. Then switch on the mechanical oscillator to move the sieves-nest up and down with a frequency of 30-35 cycles/minute and a stroke of 3.8 cm. 11. Sieve for 10 minutes.  12. Remove the sieves-nest from the water and allow it to drain for some time.  13. Transfer the soil resting on each screen with a stream of distilled water and brush into a big 
Al-metal pot (known weight). Leave the washed water-stable aggregates in the pot for 4-6 hours to precipitate all the suspended fractions and decant some of the water pot to reduce the drying period. 14.

Wt (agg+s) = Weight of oven-dry aggregates and sand (g) 
Wts = Weight of oven-dry sand (g) 
I = Size group 4.6. Soil Bulk Density   
Soil bulk density (BD) is ratio of the mass (oven-dry weight) of the soil to the bulk volume expressed in grams per cubic cm (g/cm3) or tons per cubic meter (t/m3), which includes the volume  of both solids and pore space at a specified soil water content (usually the moisture content at sampling). The BD may be dependent on soil conditions at sampling time. Changes in soil swelling due to changes in water content can alter BD. Soil mass remains fixed, but the volume of soil may change as water content changes. 
Bulk density is a parameter that indicates soil structure and void space. The BD is required to calculate porosity when particle density is known, to convert weights to volume, and to estimate weights of soil volumes too large to weigh. It is also required to convert data from a weight to a volume basis, to estimate saturated hydraulic conductivity (Ks), and to identify compacted horizons. 
For example, the volumetric content of water in a soil layer is obtained by multiplying the gravimetric water content by the product of the BD and the volume of the soil layer.  
Soil BD is an indirect measure of the total pore space which is also affected by texture and structure. The BD of fine textured mineral soils usually ranges from about 1.0 to 1.5 g/cm3, and that of sandy soils from 1.3 to 1.7 g/cm3. The bulk density of organic soils is usually much less than that of mineral soils and may be as low as 0.4 g/cm3. Bulk density and total pore space are readily altered by tillage operations. 
Two methods are commonly used to determine soil BD: one with samples of disturbed soil, and the other with undisturbed soil. The second method uses consolidated soil masses, e.g., clods and cores.      - 46 - Apparatus Trowel or shovel Sampling cylinders Plastic bags Hammer  
Knife 4.6.1. Soil bulk density - disturbed samples 
This method is used when it is not possible to take a consolidated sample of soil, as in sandy soils and soils of greenhouses and nurseries, because they are loose and very friable. 
Procedure 1. Remove any loose material from the surface, i.e., the O horizon or any other material at the surface. When sampling subsurface horizons, dig a large pit to the required depth. 2. Make a flat and horizontal area a little larger than the cylinder (metal ring). 3. Place the cylinder on the soil surface (or subsurface horizon); put one end of the cylinder (usually 75-mm and 50-mm height ring with sharp cutting edge at the bottom and removable one at the top) while holding the other end with one hand. Hammer the cylinder into the soil with blows until the top of the cylinder is flush with the surface. Stop regularly and check how much deeper the cylinder has to go.  Note 
If you strike too often, the soil in the cylinder will be compressed and the results will be wrong. 4. Dig around and under the cylinder and carefully remove it. With a knife, trim any protruding soil flush with the ends of the cylinder. 5. If the ends have small holes, these may be filled with soil, but if holes are too big, the sample must be discarded. 6. Put the sample in a plastic bag and label it appropriately.  Note 
Do not put the cylinder itself in the bag (the Sharpe edges my perforate the bag). Take a replicate sample and put it in a bag. 7. The volume of your samples is equivalent to the volume of the cylinder. 8. In the laboratory, calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil in the cylinder, after drying it in an oven at 104 °C until the weight is constant (usually after 24 h).      - 47 - Calculation                   Where: BD = Bulk density (g/cm3) 
W = Weight of oven-dry soil (g)  V = Volume of soil sample (cm3) 
Technical Remarks 1 The BD is commonly calculated on an oven-dry basis, but for certain uses it is calculated on a wet-soil basis. 2 If the sample contains rock fragments, put the wet sample through a 2-mm sieve. Dry, weigh, and record weight of the rock fragments that are retained on the sieve. Determine the volume of the rock fragments based on their weight and an assumed a particle density of 2.65g/cm3 -unless better knowledge is available. Subtract the weight of the rock fragments from the total weight of the sample and subtract their volume from the total volume of the sample.  3 The BD measurement should be performed at the soil surface and /or in a compacted zone (plow pan, etc.) if one is present. 4 To get a more representative BD measurement of the area, additional samples may be taken. 5 If BD is sampled frequently a special sampling device like the one sketched below may be acquired. The advantage of such a sampler is that the weight used for hammering (dark gray shaded piece to the left) is guided by the handle allowing for convenient and pain-free hammering. The diameter of base part must be adapted so as to hold a usual standard core ring (light gray-shaded). It is also advisable to leave a ~1 cm edge (indicated in red) at the lower part of the cylinder holding the core rings. This facilitates taking samples without compacting them.       - 48 - 4.6.2. Soil bulk density - undisturbed samples  4.5.2.1. Clod method 
The basis for this method is the measurement of the volume of a clod by utilizing the buoyancy principle, as follows: When a solid material (density greater than water) is immersed in water (an upward directed force equal to the weight of the water displaced) is exerted upon it. Thus, if a solid object is weighed first in air (the buoyant force of air can be considered negligible in this case) and then in water, the difference between the two weights represents the weight of displaced water. The weight of displaced water in grams equals its volume in cm3 (assuming that the density of the water is 1 g/cm3).When measuring the volume of a soil clod, the clod is coated with paraffin to keep water out of the pores. The volume of water displaced by the clod is equal to the volume of the paraffin coated minus the volume of the paraffin. Reagent Melted wax (paraffin wax) 
Procedure 1. Carefully collect soil clods from a soil profile. If roots are present, cut them carefully with scissors. 2. Tie and hold the clod with a fine copper wire and carefully weigh it. 3. Dip the clod in the melted wax, hang it to dry for 30 minutes. Additional melted wax coatings may be applied to make the clod more water-proof. 4. Weigh the coated clod and wire in air (Wta). 5. To determine the volume of the clod, weigh it while suspended in water with a balance that can accept the clod hanging on the balance beam by the thin copper wire (Wtw). The drop in weight (Wta – Wtw) is equal to the weight or volume of the water displaced, which is the volume of the clod. 6. If such a balance is not available, immerse the clod completely in a graduated cylinder half full with water, and detect the change in water volume in the cylinder (V). 7. On a separate sample, determine the moisture content of the soil sample and calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil (Wt) or break the clod and take a sample for the determination of soil moisture content.   
Calculations                     –                        Where:    
Wt = Weight of oven-dry solid particles in the clod (g) 
Wta – Wtw = Weight of the water displaced by the clod (g) or volume of the clod (cm3) 
V = Change in volume of water in the graduated cylinder (cm3)    - 49 - 
Technical Remarks 1. The clod method may yield higher BD values than other methods. 2. If such a wax is not available, a resin, such as Dow Saran F 310 can be use (general purpose non-crystalline copolymer). Dow Saran (F 310) is dissolved in acetone at a saran: solvent ratio of 1:7. Acetone is flammable; therefore, this mixture should be prepared in a fume hood and a tightly closed container to prevent volatilization.  3. The difference between the weight of the paraffin clod in air and its weight in water is the weight of water displaced by the clod, assuming the density of water is 1 g/cm3. (The actual value is 0.9982 g/cm3 at 20 °C). Hence, the weight of water displaced in grams is equal to the volume of the clod and paraffin in cm3. 4. To obtain the volume of the clod alone, subtract the volume of the paraffin. The paraffin's volume is calculated from its weight and density which is 0.80 g/cm3. 5. The BD is determined by dividing the oven-dry weight of the soil by its bulk volume. 6. Melted wax (paraffin wax) could be used as a replacement to the dissolved saran resin. 4.5.2.2. Core method Apparatus Metal ring  Cylinder  Wood and a hammer  Oven 
Procedure 1. Remove any loose material from the surface, i.e., the O horizon, or any other material at the surface. When sampling subsurface horizons a large pit has to be dug to the required depth. 2. Make a flat and horizontal area a little larger than the cylinder (metal ring). 3. Carefully drive cylinder (known volume) into the soil with a block of wood and a hammer. Be careful to avoid compaction of the soil during collection of the cores. After careful removal of the soil core, examine it and trim the ends carefully. 4. Weigh the soil and cylinder (Wtsc).  5. Calculate the weight of the soil sample alone by subtracting the weight of the cylinder. 6. Take a portion of this soil for the determination of soil moisture and calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil in the sample. 7. Calculate BD in g/cm3. 
Calculation                       Where: 
Wtsc = Weight of oven-dry soil core (g) V = Volume of soil core (cm3) Technical Remark 
The BD value of undisturbed cores is practical significance as it indicates soil aggregation and structure under field conditions.    - 50 - 4.7. Particle Density  
Soil particle density (PD) is defined as the ratio of the mass (oven dry weight) of the soil particles to the particle volume expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (only solid no pore space). The volume of soil is determined by measuring the volume of water displaced by the particles. The magnitude of PD depends on the type of minerals in the particles, and the content of organic matter (OM) in the soil. 
The particle density of most soils varies from 2.60 to 2.75 g/cm3. When the average PD is not known, a value of 2.65 g/cm3 is generally assumed. Organic soils have a lower PD since OM has a density of 1.2 – 1.5 g/cm3. However, PD is used with BD to calculate soil porosity. Two methods for PD determination are common. The first method uses a graduated cylinder and the second method a 
Pycnometer (volumetric flask) which is a specific gravity flask fitted with a ground glass stopper that is pierced lengthwise by a capillary opening. Both analyses are simple and rapid.  4.7.1. Graduated Cylinder Method Apparatus Graduated cylinder Stirring rod  Oven  Desiccators

Stir thoroughly with a stirring rod to displace the air, and rinse the stirring rod and the inner walls of the cylinder with 10 mL water. 4. Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes and record the volume of the soil plus 60 mL water. 5. On a separate sample, determine the moisture content of the soil sample and calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil. 6. Add the amount of moisture to the amount of added water to obtain the total amount of water used. 7. Calculate PD in g/cm3.

Procedure 1. Weigh a clean and dry Pycnometer flask including the stopper in air (WtP). 2. Weigh about 10 g air-dry soil (2-mm) into a weighted Pycnometer. 
Note: The Pycnometer should be cleaned of any soil (the outside and neck) that might have spilled during transfer. 3. Weigh the Pycnometer, including stopper and soil sample (WtP+S). 4. On a separate sample, determine the gravimeter water content of the soil sample and calculate the weight of oven-dry soil from the duplicate sample (Өm). 5. Fill the Pycnometer about one-half full with DI water (DI water is boiled and cooled to room temperature), washing into the flask any soil adhering to the inside of the neck. 6. Remove entrapped air by gently boiling the water over a hot plate; with frequent gentle agitation of the contents to prevent soil loss by foaming (boil for several minutes till no air bubbles are visible). 7. Cool the Pycnometer and its contents to room temperature in a vacuum desiccator. 8. Add enough DI water at room temperature to fill the Pycnometer. 9. Insert the stopper and seat it carefully. Thoroughly dry and clean the outside of the flask with a dry cloth, using care to avoid drawing water out of the capillary.  10. Weigh the Pycnometer and its contents (WtP+S+W). 11. Remove the soil from the Pycnometer, and thoroughly wash it.  12.

Weigh the flask plus water (Wt1), and then discard the water and dry the flask thoroughly. 3. Weigh accurately 50 g air-dry soil (2-mm) (Wt).  4. Transfer quantitatively to the volumetric flask, which should be cleaned of any soil that might have spilled during transfer. 5. Add 50 mL with boiled and cooled DI water into the flask, washing down any soil particles adhering to the neck. 6. Heat the flask gently on a hot plate until the water starts to boil in order to drive out air from the soil. 7. Cool the content and bring up to the 100-mL mark with DI water. 8. Weigh the volumetric flask with its content (Wt2). 9. On a separate sample, determine the moisture content of the soil by the gravimetric method to find the oven-dry weight of the soil in the flask. 10.

Wt2 = Weight the volumetric flask with its content (g)  4.8. Total Pore Space and Porosity 
The total pore space (TPS) consists of the PS between adjacent sand, silt and clay particles and those between aggregates. Percent pore space (PS) is the ratio of the volume of voids in a soil to the total volume (bulk volume) of the soil times 100. Texture and structure are the main factors governing the amount of PS in soil. The OM affects pore space indirectly by improving structure. If the aggregation of a particular soil is increased, the TPS increases, and the weight per unit volume or BD of the soil decreases. A medium textured mineral soil that is in good structural condition for plant growth has a 
PS of about 50 %. This PS is important for gas exchange (O2 and CO2) between the soil and the atmosphere, and water storage and movement. The PS is filled with air and water. Depending on pore size, pore spaces are given the name macro-pores (large) or micro-pores (small). There is no sharp line of demarcation between the two pore sizes. 
Calculation                       –               Where: PD = Particle density (g/cm3) 
BD= Bulk density (g/cm3)       - 54 - 4.9. Soil Water Retention Curve (pF-curve) 
Soils are equilibrated with water at various tensions and later the moisture content is determined. 
The ability of soil to retain water depends on several factors, e.g., texture, OM content (due to its hydrophilic nature), nature of mineral colloids, arrangement of particles (soil structure) and its bulk density. The relation between soil moisture tension and soil moisture content is called water retention curve. Usually the tension is expressed as the logarithmic value of cm water and the graph is referred to as a pF-curve. The pF-value is obtained from soil water pressure head according to the formula:                     
Where, h is the soil water pressure head (cm). The soil water pressure head is zero when the soil is fully saturated (no air in the pores), the permanent wilting point (PWP) is at approximately 15000 cm, i.e. pF = 4.2, and the field capacity (FC) ranges between -100 cm (pF = 2) to -500 cm (pF = 2.69) depending on the soil texture. Water can exist in soil under a tension varying from pF = 0 (no tension) to pF = 7.0 (high tension). A positive value of a tension in-situ, i.e., a pressure, indicates that water is ponded on top of the soil.   The below figure displays the pF-curve of three soil with different soil texture  
The FC is the point at which water is held in soil after excess water has drained out driven by gravity. The PWP is the point at which water is held in soil at a force that cannot be removed by common crops. Water in air-dry soil is held with a tension of pF 6.0 to 7.0. 
The available water capacity (AWC) or the plant-avaialbe water (PAW) is the amount of water retain in the soil that can be removed by plants. It is estimated as the difference in the soil water content between FC and PWP.                                     - 55 - 
Soil moisture characteristic are used to determine:  1) the water that can be readily absorbed by plant roots (for irrigation purposes), 2) the effective pore space and porosity, 3) specific yield (for drainage design), and 4) indicate changes in the structure of a soil (caused by tillage, mixing of soil layers). Sometimes the relationship between soil moisture tension and other soil physical properties, e.g., capillary conductivity, thermal conductivity, clay and OM content is subject of research. 4.9.1. Ceramic Plate Method (0.1 to 15 bar)  
The ceramic plate equipment is suitable for determination of pF-curves in the pF range of 2.0-4.2 (0.1-15 bar of suction). Soil moisture is removed from the soil samples by raising air pressure in an extractor. A porous ceramic plate serves as a hydraulic link for water to move from the soil to the exterior of the extractor. The high-pressure air will not flow through the pores in the plate since the pores are filled with water. The smaller the pore size, the higher the pressure that can be exerted before air will pass through.  Low range: moisture at 0-100KPa (0-1 bar) pressure Apparatus 
One - bar pressure plate extractor  One - bar ceramic plates

Procedure 1. Soak the pressure plates thoroughly in DI water overnight prior to use. 2. Place pressure plates on a workbench.  3. Place labeled rubber rings in order the plate (each plate accommodates 12 samples). 4. Fill ring with air-dry soil (2-mm) using a spatula (about 20 g sample). In order to avoid particle-size segregation, place entire soil sample into the ring, and then level, but don’t pack.  5. Add water between the rings until there is an excess of water (at least 3-mm deep) on the plate. 6. Cover plate and samples with plastic sheet. 7. Allow samples to stand overnight. 8. The next morning, remove excess water from the plate with a certain tool (e.g., syringe, disposable pipette, or siphon). 9. Place the triangular support in the extractor vessel on the bottom. 10. Install plate with samples in the lower-most position in the extractor. Then install the middle and top plates (the plastic disks should be placed between plates). 11. Connect outflow tubes. 12. Close extractor and tighten, ensuring that the “O” ring is in place and all nuts are uniformly tightened. Apply desired pressure in the 0 – 100 kPa (0 – 1 bar) range. Build up the pressure in the vessel gradually. 13. Place a beaker to collect water from the outflow tubes. 14. Leave overnight.    - 56 - 15. Maintain pressure until no more water is being released (generally 18-20 hours, but for some soils 48 hours or even longer). 16. Release pressure from extractor (remove outflow tubes from water before turning instrument off). 17. Open extractor.  18. Without undue delay, transfer moist soil sample from ring with a wide- bladed spatula to a tarred dish (It is not necessary to make a quantitative transfer of the entire soil). 19. Immediately, weigh wet sample (accuracy 0.01 g) and place in drying oven at 105 0C for 24 hours. 20. Place samples in a desiccator, cool, and weigh.

Procedure 1. Use 15-bar ceramic plates and follow Steps 1-14 of the previous method, applying 1-15 bar pressure (100-1500 KPa). 2. Samples should stay in extractor until flow has ceased from all samples on plate and the soils have reached equilibrium (24–48 hours for most soil; however some fine textured and organic soils may needs up to 120 hours). Stop the water outflow tubes from extractor which indicate the equilibrium has been attained. 3. Release pressure from extractor (remove outflow tubes from water before turning instrument off). 4. Follow Steps 17–20 of the previous method. 
Calculation                                –                                       - 57 - 
Technical Remarks 1 Checking the pressure plate: Install the pressure plate to be used in a pressure cooker. Fill with water, fasten the lid on the cooker, and measure the rate of outflow of water from the ceramic plates at a pressure of 15 bar, the rate should be about 1 mL per cm2/h/atm. 
Pressure difference or greater for satisfactory operation of the porous plates.  2 Checking the pressure of the ceramic plate: push a free air pressure inside the ceramic pressure plate and then close the outflow valve by the finger, then submerge the ceramic pressure plate in a tank filled with water. If there is air leaks at the ceramic pressure plate gasket or attendant connections, the ceramic pressure plate should be replaced. 3 If the outlets of the plates (cooker) continue to bubble after a few hours of applied pressure, the plates are probably defective and should be replaced (air leaks cause troubles with air pressure control and serious errors in retentively determination through direct loss of water vapor from the soil sample).   4 Pressure should not be allowed to fluctuate during a run. It should be checked after every 2-3 h (adjusted if necessary). If the pressure fluctuations are within the specified tolerance of the regulator, no adjusting is needed. 5 During an experimental run, equilibrium is reached when water flow from the outflow tube ceases. At equilibrium, there is an exact relationship between the air pressure in the extractor and the soil suction (and hence the moisture content) in the samples. Accuracy of equilibrium values will be no more accurate than the regulation of air supply; therefore the pressure control panel has independent double regulators. 6 The height of the sample in the ring should be as small as possible to reduce the time required to reach equilibrium, which is proportional to the square of the height of the sample in the ring. 7 Never remove extractor lid with pressure in the container.  8 The FC is commonly estimated by measuring the moisture retained at the following pressure: 
Course-textured Soils 10 KPa (1/10 bar)  
Medium-textured Soils 33 KPa (1/3 bar) 
Fine-textured Soils 50 KPa (1/2 bar) 9 Pascal is the standard unit for the expression of soil suction. By definition, 100 kPa is equal to 1 bar or 0.987 atmospheres or 14.5 psi. The latter units should not be used anymore. 10 The various pressure plate cells are not suitable for extracting solution from soils for chemical analysis. The immense surface are within the porous ceramic plate can cause disturbance and contamination of the soil solution. 11 Pressure plates are washed after use and dried with a coating of sand over the ceramic. This prevents fine air-borne particles from lodging in the pores of the ceramic. Then dry the sand can be brushed off and the plate stored until required.    - 58 - 4.9.2. Sandbox Method  
Sandbox can be used to apply suction from pF 0 (saturation) to pF 2.0 (-100 hPa). Sand is used to convey the suction from the drainage system to the soil samples. As the surface of the sand is flexible, the contact between the sample and the sand can be established more easily, which makes sand a better suction material than a stiff porous plate.  
Results of measurements taken with this sandbox correspond with points on the drying curves of the relevant samples; associated with decreasing pressure. These pressure values are usually standard water potential increments. The wetting curve, on the other hand, is determined by graphing the water content against increasing pressure values. This curve is not identical to the drying curve, because the water content does not respond instantaneously to changes in pressure. 
This phenomenon is called Hysteresis. Apparatus Assembling the sandbox Soil sample ring Procedure 
A. Field processing 1. Collect the soil sample by pressing a metal ring on the bulk soil sample (better when moist) until it levels with the surface. If the sampled soil volume is larger than the volume of the core ring, carefully remove excess soil by ‘chipping’ it off with a sharp edged tool. Prevent smearing the sample surface so as not to affect the physical properties of the soil.  Avoid excessive compaction or fragmentation of soil. 2. Cap the core sample ring from both sides.  3. Record all the information about samples (depth and profile), put one label inside the bag and tie the other label to the bag. Then bring the soil samples to the soil preparation laboratory. 
B. Laboratory processing 1. Each core ring is given a laboratory number.  2. Uncap the core soil sample ring, and then fix a piece of nylon cloth to the bottom side (sharp edged) of the sample with an elastic-band, or an O-ring. 3. Ensure that a 0.5 cm layer of water is covering the surface of the sand in the sandbox.  4. Place the core soil sample with the bottom side down in a homogeneous water saturated fine sand surface. Let the sample adapt for 1 hour.  The sand surface usually is covered with the same type of cloth that is used for the samples.   5. To saturate the sample, slowly raise the water level to 1-cm below the top of the sample ring.  6. Place a lid on the basin (to prevent evaporation) and allow the sample to saturate for 2 days (sandy soils) or up to 1 week (clayey soils).      - 59 - 7. Mark the rings, and draw a sketch of the box, so that the rings can be replaced in exactly the sample place after removal. 8. Take the ring carefully out of the water basin and wipe off any water drops hanging underneath the sample before weighing it. Weigh the core soil sample with an accuracy of 0.01 g. This weight (including ring, cloth and elastic) is used to calculate water content at saturation, pF 0 (weight A).  
Notes  It is difficult to transfer the saturated sample to a balance without changing water content, especially with sandy samples.  The middle of the soil sample is used as the reference level for zero pressure, but the free water level (h = 0) is in fact 1 cm below the top of the sample ring. The moisture tension thus ranges from +1 cm at the bottom of the sample, to - 4 cm at the top of the sample. Note that at lower pressures this difference due to sample size becomes less important.   9. Put the sample back to its previous positions in the sandbox. Press the ring slightly, to improve soil-sand contact. 10. Apply a suction of -2.5 cm (=-2.5 hPa, = 0.25 kPa) to the centre of the samples. 11. Leave the sample to equilibrate, (with the lid on the box to stop evaporation). This will take a few days for sandy soil, and up to a week for clayey soils. 12. Gently remove the samples and weigh them.  13. To check equilibrium, place the sample back into the sandbox (take care that the contact between sand and sample is restored) and weigh the sample again the next day. In case of equilibrium with the created tension, the difference in water content will not exceed 0.002 in volume fraction.  14. If equilibrium between soil moisture content and pressure has been established, record the weight of the sample.  15. Moisten the sand surface with a wet sponge. Do not remove the filter cloth; just clean and smoothen it at the same time to remove air bubbles and impressions.  16. Place the soil samples on the sand at exactly the same position as they were previously - use the sketch made earlier.  17. Apply the next suction level and repeat the above steps.  
Calculation                        –         –            Where: 
Wt = Weight of the water content at the various pF values (g) 
Wt1 = Weight of the ring (with sample, cloth and elastic) (g) 
Wt2 = Weight of the ring, cloth and elastic (g) 
As usually the volume of the soil is known – it is equal to the volume of the metal ring used – the above calculation can be adapted to calculate volumetric moisture content (g water/cm3 soil). 
The below figure shows provides an example of a soil water retention curve obtain with the sandbox method (ZT = zero-tillage, CT = conventional tillage; soil is a heavy clay).    - 60 -       
Technical Remarks 1. Because of the major influences of both pore size distribution and soil structure on moisture retention, especially at the high matrix potentials, care should be taken not to disturb the original setting of the soil and to completely fill the ring, when pressing the core rings into the soil.  2. Sampling conditions are best when the soil is approximately at field capacity.  3. Do not freeze the samples because soil structure will be influenced.  4. The Laboratory should have a constant temperature between measurements, since temperature changes affect water viscosity and therefore water retention values.  5. If the soil volume is less than the volume of the ring, or if the sample has been damaged during transport, the sample should not be used for analysis. Also samples with large projecting stones may have to be discarded.  6. Fast raising of the water levels in the sandbox (step 5 above) will entrap air and may damage soil structure.  7. Vibration may cause a leak between the sidewalls of the box and the sand.  8. Add (0.01 mg/l) copper sulfate to the water used in the sandbox to eliminate microbiological activity.   40 50 60 1 10 100

The 18 essential nutrients for plants are classified into four groups (Brady and Weil, 1999):  1. Major non-mineral macronutrients: these are 90 – 95 % of dry-plant weight, and are supplied to the plant by water absorption and photosynthesis, i.e., carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O);  2. Primary macronutrients, i.e., nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), potassium (K);  3. Secondary macronutrients, i.e., calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), sulfur (S); and  4. Micronutrients, i.e., boron (B), chloride (Cl), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), zinc (Zn). 
Three major factors contributing to plant nutrition are:  - The amount of available nutrients in the soil; - The soil’s ability to supply the nutrients to plants; and  - Environmental factors that affect nutrient availability and plant absorption. 
Measurements which involve characterization of the soil solution, and its constituents and of the composition of the inorganic and organic phases in soil are broadly termed chemical. This encompasses all nutrient elements and soil components which directly or indirectly influence such elements or components. This section thus constitutes the core of this manual. 
The chemical procedures presented here are extensive, though by no means exhaustive. For any one element, numerous procedures or variations of procedures can be found in the literature (Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Page, 1982; Westerman, 1990; Sparks et al., 1996). We have endeavored to select procedures, which in our experience are appropriate for soils of the Mediterranean region, i.e., where a good relationship exists between the test value and crop growth. Where alternative methods are appropriate, we have presented the salient features of these methods. A bibliography of soil testing information is provided for users who may need to expand or modify their range of soil testing procedures.  
We have initially presented analyses which are routinely done to characterize a soil sample or soil type in terms of background information, i.e., pH, salinity, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O). With regard to N, the dominant fertility factor in soils, we have dealt with the most convenient methods for measuring different forms or fractions of N in soils. This is subsequently followed by procedures for P, soluble and exchangeable cations, soluble anions, and micronutrients. 
Where appropriate, we have given guidelines for interpreting the data produced with the analytical procedures listed (see Appendix 9).

The use of an extract from a saturated paste is advantageous for characterizing saline soils since it closely approximates salinity in relation to plant growth. One can also obtain soluble cations and anions by this method and estimate other important parameters such as Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) which, in turn, predicts Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP). Criteria for B toxicity tolerance by various plant species have been also developed for such an extract (see Appendix 15).Thus; a saturation extract is routinely used where salinity is a concern. The cations analyzed in saturation extracts are Ca, Mg, K, and Na, while the anions are SO4 (sulfate), CO3  (carbonate), HCO3 (bicarbonate) and Cl (chloride). Boron (B) in saturation extracts is often measured where its toxicity is suspected. Apparatus Porcelain dishes Spatulas or mixing spoons Vacuum filtration system 
Procedure 1. Weigh 200-300 g air-dry soil (< 2-mm) into a porcelain dish.  2. Slowly add DI water, and mix with a spatula until the soil paste:  - Does not have free-standing water on the surface of the paste. - Slides freely and cleanly off a spatula (does not apply to clay soils, > 40% clay). - Flows slightly when the container is tipped to a 45 o from horizontal. - Soil surface glistens as it reflects light. - Consolidates easily by tapping after a trench is formed in the paste with the flat side of a spatula (does not apply to sandy soils, >70% sand).  3. Allow the paste to stand for 1 hour, and then re-check the criteria for saturation by adding more DI water or soil, as needed. 4. Leave the paste for 6 to 16 hours and then filter with a vacuum filtration system using a 
Buchner funnel fitted with Whatman No. 42 filter paper. 5. Collect filtrate in a small bottle and keep it for subsequent measurements. If the initial filtrate is turbid, re-filter. 
Technical Remarks 1. Do not stir soil until the entire soil mass is wet. 2. After first wetting, the paste usually stiffens and loses its shine on standing. Adding water and re-mixing gives a mixture that retains the characteristic of a saturated paste. 3. Gypsum soil samples should not be oven-dried above 70 oC, prior to extracting for soluble salts, because heating to 105 °C partially converts gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) to partially hydrated gypsum (CaSO4.½H2O), which is more soluble in water than the fully hydrated gypsum.     - 63 - 4. For organic and peat soils (>16 % OM) it is advisable to start with a 150 mL water and slowly add soil material and water. Soak overnight wetting to obtain a definite end point for the saturated paste. Some high organic matter soils swell considerably upon addition of water. In such cases, the method must be repeated until the saturated paste characteristics are stable. 5. Fine textured soils (> 40% clay) may puddle easily. To minimize puddle and obtain more definite endpoint for the saturated paste, water should be added with a minimum amount of stirring, especially in the early stages of wetting. The method must be repeated until the saturated paste characteristics are stable.  6. For some soil types (coarse textured soils, sandy loam and loamy sand with less than 15% clay), may not exhibit saturated paste characteristics of finer textured soils. Therefore, the relative accuracy of the method declines and should be noted when making soil comparisons. 7. For salinity appraisal, the saturated paste can be extracted after 4 hours.  8. For sodic soil samples, it should stand 16 or more hours.  9. For the soluble B, it should stand 24 hours or more (saturated paste equilibration is required). 10. For CaCO3 if precipitates are noted in the extract, dilute paste extract 1:1 with DI water and note dilution in subsequent analysis. The paste extract may be refrigerated (4 oC) for storage (do not allow to freeze) more than 30 days by adding small quantities (2-mL) of toluene to minimize microbial activity. 11. Approximately one quarter to one third of the water added in making the saturated paste can be recovered as extract. 12. Because KCl from the pH electrode can contaminate the paste, it is recommended that a separate paste should be made for EC determination. If, however, there are not enough samples for two separate pastes, then the same paste can be used for both analyses; ensure that the pH electrode is not left in the paste unnecessarily. 5.1.1. Saturated Paste Percentage  
Soil moisture, as determined on a separate sample, is taken into consideration by adding it to the amount of water used in preparing the saturation paste. Report the saturation percentage (SP) to the nearest 0.1 %. The SP is calculated by dividing the total amount of water added (mL) by the oven-dry weight of the soil (g) and multiplying by 100. 
Procedure 1. Weigh a 30-50 g sub-sample of the paste into a dried and weighed metal can with lid. 2. Dry in an oven, with the lid unfitted, at 105 °C for 4 hours. 3. Remove from oven, fit the lid, and cool in a desiccator for at least 30 minutes. 4. Re-weigh and calculate SP.  
Note: Oven-dry moisture values will be slightly higher than the direct method as air-dry soil will retain 3-5 % moisture, dependent on clay and salt content.      - 64 -

Or                                                                                                  
Technical Remarks 1. The SP is directly related to field moisture range (e.g., PWP is about one fourth of SP, and FC is about one half of SP).  2. Oven-dry moisture values will be slightly higher than the direct method as air-dry soil will retain 3-5 % moisture, dependent on clay and salt content. 3. For mineral soils, about twice of the FC is generally the amount of water required to obtain 
SP.  4. The SP is related to soil texture (based on OM contents less than 3%), as follows: sand or loamy sand (<20); sandy loam (20-35); loam or silt loam (35-50); clay loam (50-65); clay (65 135); and organic soils (> 81). 5. For fine-textured soils and those high in Na (SAR > 10), the SP cannot be used to estimate FC and PWP values.                                                                                                                            - 65 - 5.2. pH 
Soil pH is a crucial soil indicator, and is defined as the negative log of the hydrogen ion activity. Since pH is logarithmic, the H-ion concentration in solution increases ten times when its pH is lowered by one unit. The pH range normally found in soils varies from 3 to 9. Various categories of soil pH may be arbitrarily described as follows:  - Strongly acid (pH < 5.0) -  Moderately to slightly acid (5.0-6.5) - Neutral (6.5-7.5) -  Moderately alkaline (7.5-8.5), and -  Strongly alkaline (> 8.5) 
The significance of pH lies in its influence on availability of soil nutrients, solubility of toxic nutrient elements in the soil, physical breakdown of root cells, and CEC in soils whose colloids (clay/humus) are pH-dependent and biological activity. At high pH values, availability of P, and most micronutrients, except B and Mo, tends to decrease (see Box No. 2 for more details). 
Acid soils are rare in semi-arid, dryland areas of the world; they tend to occur in temperate and tropical areas where rainfall is substantial; conversely, soils of drier areas are generally alkaline, i.e., above pH 7.0, as a result of the presence of CaCO3, and will visibly effervesce (fizz) when 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added dropwise to the soil. Most soils in the WANA region have pH values of 8.0 – 8.5. Calcareous soils with gypsum have somewhat lower pH values, while those with excess Na have values over 8.5 (sodic soils). 
Apparatus pH meter with combined electrode

De-ionized water pH 7.0 buffer solution pH 4.0 buffer solution      - 66 - 
Procedure  1 Weigh 50 g air-dry soil (< 2-mm) into a 100-mL glass beaker.  2 Add 50 mL DI water using a graduated cylinder or 50-mL volumetric flask. 3 Mix well with a glass rod, and allow to stand for 30 minutes. 4 Stir suspension every 10 minutes during this period. 5 After 1 hour, stir the suspension. 6 Calibrate the pH meter (see Box No. 3 for more details). 7 Put the combined electrode in suspension (about 3-cm deep). Take the reading after 30 seconds with one decimal. 8 Remove the combined electrode from the suspension, and rinse thoroughly with DI water in a separate beaker, and carefully dry excess water with a tissue. 
Technical Remakes 1. Make sure that the combined electrode contains saturated KCl solution and some solid KCl. 2. At ICARDA, pH is measured in a 1:1 (soil: water) suspension. For special purposes, pH can be measured in a saturated soil paste, or in more dilute suspensions. In some laboratories, pH is measured in a suspension of soil and 1 N KCl or 0.01 M CaCl2.  3. The pH measured in 0.01 M CaCl2 is about 0.5 unit lower than that measured in water (soil: liquid ratio of 1:2). 4. For soil samples very high in organic matter, use a 1:2 or 1:5 (soil: water) ratio. 5. The main advantage of the measurement of soil pH in salt solution is the tendency to eliminate interference from suspension effects and from variable salt contents, such as fertilizer residues. 6. Air-dry soils may be stored several months in closed containers without affecting the pH measurement. 7. Air-drying can cause changes in pH values (e.g., through oxidation of sulfides). The determination of pH of field moist samples presents two limitations: taking a representative samples is difficult; and biological activity can affect pH during storage of soils in their natural state of moisture. Air-drying prevents development of acidity during moist storage.  8. Presence of clay may slow the electrode response. To avoid this, thoroughly clean electrode between samples. If electrode response is slow, clean by immersing in weak HCl solution overnight. 9. Suspended colloids influence pH through the junction potential effect. In the presence of negatively charged colloids (e.g., clay particles or organic matter), pH measured in the suspension will usually be lower than measurement in the supernatant liquid. This is the suspension effect. This effect is extremely pronounced in peat soils because there is often little supernatant and soil sediment. In every sample, therefore, place the electrode junction at the same distance above the surface of the soil to maintain uniformity in pH reading. The 
CO3 status of some soils changes with time; therefore, undue delay in taking a reading after introducing the electrode should be avoided. The initial pH of a non-alkaline soil may be as much as 0.5 pH unit greater than the reading taken after the sample has stood for 30 minutes or longer.    - 67 - 5.3. Electrical Conductivity 
Soil salinity refers to the concentration of soluble inorganic salts in the soil. It is normally measured by extracting the soil sample with water (1:1 or 1:5 soil: water ratio, w/v) or in an extract saturated paste. However, soil: solution ratios of a 1:1 or wider are more convenient where the quantity of soil is limited. Such extracts are rapid, and salinity is measured by electrical conductivity (EC) using a conductivity bridge. The total salt content of a soil can be estimated from this measurement. A more precise method involves evaporation of the aqueous extract and weighing the residue (total dissolved solids, TDS).  
Salinity is an important laboratory measurement since it reflects the extent to which the soil is suitable for growing crops. However, salinity affects plants at all stages of development and for some crops sensitivity varies from one growth stage to another. While salinity is largely a concern in irrigated areas and in areas with saline soils, it is often less important in rainfed agriculture. However, with increasing use of irrigation, there will be greater emphasis on EC measurement in the future. The basic methodology and principles of EC measurement is given in USDA Handbook 60 (Richards, 1954). 
On the basis of a saturation extract, values of 0 to 2 dS/m are safe for all crops; yields of very sensitive crops are affected between 2 to 4 dS/m; many crops are affected between 4 and 8 dS/m; while only tolerant crops grow reasonably well above that level (see Appendix 14).

This solution gives an electrical conductivity of 1.413 dS/m at 25 °C.       - 68 - 
Procedure 1. Weigh 50 g air-dry soil (< 2-mm) into a 100-mL glass beaker, as for pH determination.  2. Add 50 mL DI water using a graduated cylinder or 50-mL volumetric flask. 3. Mix well with a glass rod, and allow to stand for 30 minutes. 4. Stir suspension every 10 minutes during this period. 5. After 1 hour, stir the suspension. 6. Filter the suspension using suction. First, put a round Whatman No. 42 filter paper in the 
Buchner funnel. Second, moisten the filter paper with DI water and make sure that it is tightly attached to the bottom of the funnel and that all holes are covered. 7. Start the vacuum pump. 8. Open the suction, and add suspension to Buchner funnel.  9. Continue filtration until the soil on the Buchner funnel starts cracking. If the filtrate is not clear, repeat the procedure. 10. Calibrate the conductivity meter according to maker’s instructions (see Box No. 4 for more details). 11. Transfer the clear filtrate into a 50-mL bottle, immerse the conductivity cell in the solution, and take the reading.  12. Remove the conductivity cell from the solution, rinse thoroughly with DI water, and dry excess water with a tissue. 
Technical Remarks 1. Readings are recorded in deci-Siemens per meter (dS/m).  2. Exposure of the saturated soil sample or extracting solution to the atmosphere may cause changes in conductivity due to loss or gain of dissolved gasses: CO2 and NH3-N. Freshly distilled water has a conductivity of 0.005 - 0.002 dS/m increasing after a few weeks to 0.002 -0.004 dS/m. This is a special concern on samples with very low ECe. 3. The EC should be measured as soon as the extracts are prepared because of possible changes in ionic content due to microbial activity during storage at room temperature. If needed, however, extracts can be stored for a week under refrigeration (4 °C) before measuring EC. 5.4. Calcium Carbonate 
Inorganic carbonate, either as calcium (calcite) or magnesium (dolomite) carbonate or mixtures of both, occurs in soils as a result of weathering, or is inherited from the parent material. Most soils of arid and semi-arid regions are calcareous. In fact, soils of the arid/ semi-arid regions may be mostly of CaCO3. As with alkaline pH, the soil retention of P, Mn, Zn and Cu is directly related to carbonate content and to the distribution of total and active CaCO3 between the clay and silt fractions. 
Consequently, CaCO3 equivalent is normally determined in most laboratories. While some laboratories also determine “active” CaCO3, it is less common than “total” CaCO3, being mainly in areas of French influence since it was developed by Drouineau (1942) in France. It basically reflects surface area or reactivity of CaCO3 particles, mainly the clay-size fraction.  
Active CaCO3 is usually related to total CaCO3 equivalent, being about 50% or so of the total value. Proponents of its use claim that this fraction is more closely related to nutrient behavior, such as involved with Fe chlorosis. Some methods of CaCO3 determination in soils are based on the collection of CO2 gas, and the measurement of CO2 pressure which develops if acid is added to a calcareous soil in a closed flask.     - 69 - 5.4.1. Total Calcium Carbonate 
Carbonate in the sample is dissolved in the excess of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The remainder of the acid is titrated against sodium hydroxide (NaOH). However, a given weight of soil is reacted with an excess of acid. In this reaction, CO2 gas is released and the acid not used in the dissolution of carbonates is back-titrated with NaOH solution. In the titration method, two equivalents of acid are assumed to react with one mole of CaCO3. Hence, one equivalent of acid is assumed to be equivalent to one-half mole of CaCO3.

In order to standardize the hydrochloric acid (1N) and sodium hydroxide (1N) solutions used in the determination of CaCO3:  Pipette 10 mL 1 N Na2CO3 solution into a 100-mL Erlenmeyer flask, add 2 drops methyl orange indicator, and titrate this solution against 1 N HCl (in the burette).

NHCl = Normality of HCl solution 
NNa2CO3 = Normality of Na2CO3 solution

Wt = Weight of air-dry soil (g) 
V = Volume of NaOH solution used (mL)  0.05 is equivalent weight of CaCO3 (50/1000) 
Technical Remarks 1. Some experience is needed to accurately determine color change of the suspension from colorless to pink. 2. 10 mL 1 N HCl would dissolve up to 0.5 g CaCO3. If a soil contains 50% CaCO3 or more, 15 or 20 mL would have to be added. 3. When a soil is reacted with acid to dissolve carbonates, other soil components may also consume acid. Most of the latter reactions are assumed to be reversible, i.e., if the suspension is back-titrated, the acid is released again. For this reason, it is not recommended to filter the suspension and titrate the clear filtrate. The color change is easier to determine in a clear solution, but the titration value may over-estimate the actual soil CaCO3 content. 4. Not all reactions involving acid and soil components are completely reversible, and therefore the acid titration of the soil suspension may also slightly over-estimate the actual soil carbonate content. The acid titration method can be calibrated against the Calcimeter method. 5. The retention or precipitation of P, Mn, Zn and Cu is often related to the total amount of carbonates.  Active Calcium Carbonate 
Measurement is based on reaction with excess ammonium oxalate followed by titration with permanganate in an acid medium. Most of the reversibly adsorbed Ca (on clay minerals) is released and precipitated as calcium oxalate. Part of the CaCO3 in soil is dissolved and the Ca precipitated as the oxalate. The soluble “active” CaCO3 is assumed to include the smaller particles (less than 2-mm) and some amorphous forms of CaCO3. The reaction of ammonium oxalate with CaCO3 can be written as follows: 
CaCO3+ 2 NH4 + C2O4 → CaC204 (s) + 2NH3 + H20 + CO2 
The oxalate also reacts with dissolved and exchangeable Ca to form oxalate; therefore, the procedure should more appropriately be called an “active” Ca procedure rather than an “active” CO3 procedure. The reaction of un-reacted ammonium oxalate (following acidification with H2SO4) is summarized by the following equation: 2MnO4 + 5 H2C204 + 6 H → 2 Mn + 10 CO2 + 8 H20 
After equilibration the suspension is filtered and the remaining oxalate is titrated with permanganate in an acid medium. Once all the oxalate is oxidized, the solution turns pink, because of the permanganate.      - 72 - Apparatus Hot plate Burette Erlenmeyer flask Volumetric pipette Reagents

Technical Remarks 1. This method should not be applied to soils that contain gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O), or that are high in organic matter (OM). 2. The potassium permanganate can be standardized by titrating with the primary standard sodium oxalate (Na2C2O4), which is dissolved in H2SO4 to form oxalic acid: 5H2C2O4 + 2MnO4 +6H → 10CO2 + 2Mn + 8H2O 3. The solution must be heated to 80 – 90 oC for rapid reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by Mn produced and it goes very slowly at first until some Mn is formed. The first persistent pink color (30 seconds) should be taken as the end point. Determine a blank by titrating an equal volume of 1 M H2SO4  4. Precautions should be taken to ensure uniformity of sample handling and shaking procedures. Major sources of error include solution and exchangeable Ca and the inability of oxalate to react with Mg in Mg-substituted calcite. 5. The maximum quantity of “active” CaCO3 that can be dissolved by the above procedure is 200 g/ kg (20%) soil. If “active” CaCO3 contents greater than about 150 g/kg (17%) are obtained, then the analysis should be repeated with a smaller amount of soil and/or a larger volume of ammonium oxalate.       - 74 - 5.5. Organic Matter 
Soil organic matter (SOM) represents the remains of roots, plant material, and soil organisms in various stages of decomposition and synthesis, and is variable in composition. Though occurring in relatively small amounts in soils, organic matter (OM) has a major influence on soil aggregation, nutrient reserve and its availability, moisture retention, and biological activity. Soil Organic Carbon (SOC) ranges from being the dominant constituent of peat or muck soils in colder regions of the world to being virtually absent in some desert soils. Cultivated, temperate-region soils normally have often than 3 – 4 % SOM, while soils of semi-arid rainfed areas, such as in the WANA region, have normally less than 1.5 % SOM.  
Most laboratories in the region perform analysis for SOM, which can be measured by. either  the loss after ignition method, i.e., weight change  destruction of organic compounds by H2O2 treatment or by ignition at high temperature, or by  wet combustion analysis of soils by chromic acid digestion , which is  the standard method for determining total C. Also, organic matter/organic carbon can be estimated by volumetric and colorimetric methods. However, the most common procedure involves reduction of potassium dichromate (K2Cr2O7) by OC compounds and subsequent determination of the unreduced dichromate by oxidation-reduction titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate. This method is referred to as the Walkley-Black method (Walkley, 1947; FAO, 1974).  
While the actual measurement is of oxidizable organic carbon, the data are normally converted to percentage organic matter using a constant factor, assuming that OM contains 58% organic carbon. 
However, as this proportion is not in fact constant, we prefer to report results as oxidizable organic carbon, or multiplied by 1.33 as organic carbon.  Apparatus

Titrate with 0.5 M ferrous ammonium sulfate solution, until the color changes from violet blue to green. 7. Prepare two blanks, containing all reagents but no soil, and treat them in exactly the same way as the soil suspensions.

Technical Remarks 1. The conversion factor for organic carbon to total organic matter for surface soils varies from 1.7 to 2.0. In the soils of arid and semi-arid regions; and a value of 1.724 (=1/0.58) is commonly used. The factors 1.334 and 1.724 used to calculate TOC and OM are approximate, and may vary with soil depth and between soils. 2. For soils high in OM (1 % oxidizable OM or more), more than 10 mL potassium dichromate is needed. 3. Soils containing large quantities of chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn) and ferrous (Fe) ions give higher results. The Cl interference can be eliminated by adding silver sulfate (Ag2SO4) to the oxidizing reagent. No known procedure is available to compensate for the other interferences. 4. The presence of CaCO3 up to 50 % of sample weight causes no interferences. 5. The Walkley-Black method for the determination of SOC in soils gives about 89% recovery of carbon as compared to the dry combustion method. The conversion factor 0.336 was obtained by dividing 0.003, the milli-equivalent weight of carbon, by 89% and multiplying by 100 to convert to percentage. Chloride interference is eliminated by the addition of the silver sulfate to the digesting acid as indicated. The presence of nitrates and carbonates up to 5 % and 50 %, respectively, do not interfere. 6. The concentration of H2SO4 should be about 6M. For this reason only 30 mL water are added. (10 mL K2Cr2O7 solution plus 20 mL concentrated H2SO4 plus 30 mL H20 give about 6 
M H2SO4). 7. Air-dried soils seldom contain sufficient amounts of Fe (II) to cause interference. Water logged soils often contain large quantities of Fe (II), but in most cases this can be oxidized by drying the soil samples prior to analysis. 8. Chloride is oxidized to chromyl chloride, which is volatilized, resulting in high OM values. If high amounts of Cl are present in the sample, add 15 g Ag2SO4 to 1-L H2SO4. 9. Sulfuric acid readily absorbs water. Therefore, use a fresh reagent. 10. Elemental C (e.g., charcoal) is not attacked by dichromate solution in this method. 11. Grinding of the samples is required only to reduce sub-sampling error. It is generally not necessary to pass the ground sample through a sieve (if required use a non-ferrous sieve).        - 77 - 5.6. Particulates Organic Matter

Wash all the retained material in the sieve to anther pre-weighed and dried beaker (600-mL), (now this suspension is called particulate organic matter, POM, with a particle size is > 53 µm). 5.

Wt2 = Weight of dried beaker (g)      - 78 - 5.7. Cation Exchange Capacity 
Many minerals in soils are negatively charged and, as a consequence, can attract and retain cations such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (M), ammonium (NH4), etc. Cation exchange is a reversible process. Thus, elements or nutrients can be held in the soil and not lost through leaching, and can subsequently be released for crop uptake. Certain organic compounds contribute to cation exchange capacity (CEC). Also, the presence of high concentrations of Ca, especially in the form of gypsum, interferes with the determination of CEC, which is an important parameter for soil fertility and mineralogical characterization. Additionally, CEC is influenced by soil pH. A certain portion of the total negative charge is permanent, while a variable portion is pH dependent. 
Several methods are available for CEC determination (Rhoades, 1982). Most methods involve saturation of the soil with an index cation (NH4), removal by washing of excess cation, and subsequent replacement of the adsorbed index cation by another cation (Na) and measurement of the index cation in the final extract (Richards, 1954). Modified procedures have been introduced because of high Ca solubility in calcareous and gypsiferous soils (FAO, 1990; Rhoades and Polemio, 1977). 
Cation exchange capacity is reported as centimoles of positive charge per kg of soil (cmol (+)/kg). The old unit milli-equivalents per 100 g (meq/100g), whereas 1 meq/100 g = 1 cmol (+)/kg), should no longer be used. Values of CEC are in the range of 1.0 to 100 cmol (+)/kg, least for sandy soils and most for clay soils. Similarly, higher CEC values reflect the dominance of 2:1 clay minerals, and lower values reflect the presence of 1:1 clay minerals. Apparatus Flame photometer

Procedure 1. Weigh 4 g (for medium to fine textured) or 6 g (for coarse textured) air-dry soil into a 40-mL centrifuge tube. 2. Add 33 mL 1 N sodium acetate trihydrate solution, stopper tube, and shake for 5 minutes. 3. Remove stopper from tube and centrifuge at 3000 rpm until supernatant liquid is clear. Decant the supernatant as completely as possible and discard. 4.

Wt = Weight of air-dry soil (g) 
Technical Remarks 1. Though quite laborious, the method of Rhoades and Polemio (1977) is more appropriate for soils containing carbonates, gypsum, and zeolite. 2. Clay mineral CEC is pH-dependent. 3. Kaolinite clays minerals have a low CEC. 4. Montmorillinitic clay minerals have a high CEC due to the negative charges developed through loss of cations during formation of these clays.  5. Organic matter has a large CEC, but it too is pH-dependent. 6. Practices such as fertilization, liming, irrigation and addition of organic manures can increase CEC.  5.8. Gypsum 
Soils with variable contents of gypsum (CaSO4.2H2O) are common in many countries of the WANA region. Gypsum is primarily a concern in irrigated areas and less so in rainfed agriculture. Thus, its determination is of importance to some laboratories in the region. The standard method for gypsum determination described here is that of Richards (1954) which involves precipitation with acetone. 
Modifications of that method and other procedures are found in the FAO bulletin on gypsiferous soils (FAO, 1990). Apparatus

Add 20 mL acetone, mix well, and let stand until precipitate is flocculated (5 to 10 minutes) 5. Centrifuge at 4000 rpm for 3 minutes, decant supernatant liquid, invert tube, and drain on filter paper for 5 minutes. 6. Disperse precipitate and rinse tube wall with a stream of 10 mL acetone blown from a pipette. 7. Again, centrifuge for 3 minutes, decant supernatant liquid, invert tube, and drain on filter paper for 5 minutes. 8. Add exactly 40 mL DI water to tube, stopper, and shake until the precipitate is completely dissolved.  9. Measure EC of solution, and correct conductivity reading to 25 °C.  10. Determine gypsum concentration in the solution by reference to a graph showing the relationship between the concentration and EC constructed by means of the following data from Richards (1954).

The Electrical Conductivity reading from 10 : 50 (soil : water ratio) is 1.211 mS/cm.  1 Gypsum from calibration curve (meq/L) = 11.629   (1.211)1.1765= 14.57 2 Water used to dissolve precipitate (mL) = 40 3 Gypsum in aliquot (meq) = (14.57 40)/1000 = 0 .58 4 Soil : water ratio  = 10 gram : 50 mL = 5 5 Soil-water  extract used (mL)  = 20 mL 6 Weight of soil used from 20 mL extract  = 20/5 = 4 g 7 Gypsum (meq/100g)  = (100   0.58)/4 = 14.57 8 Gypsum (%) = 14.57   0.086 = 1.25   
Technical Remarks 1. Sodium and potassium sulfate (K2SO4), when present in sufficiently high concentrations, is also precipitated by acetone. The maximum concentrations of sodium sulfate (NaSO4) and K that may be tolerated are 50 and 10 meq/L, respectively. 2. At a 1:5 (soil: water) ratio, water will dissolve about 15 meq gypsum / 100 g soil. If it is found that the gypsum content of the soil approaches 15 meq/100 g using a 1:5 (soil: water) extract, the determination should be repeated, using a diluted extract. 3. In some soils from the Euphrates, gypsum may be well over 25 %, in which case a dilution of 1:500 or 1:1000 (soil: water) ratio have to be used. 4. Qualitative test for gypsum should be made on all soils as a routine in order to save time later when analyzing for gypsum. Pipette 5 mL of the soil extract into a small centrifuge tube and add 5 mL acetone. Mix well, and allow to stand for 10 minutes if a flocculated white precipitate forms, the soil contains gypsum; if no precipitate forms, the soil is considered to be free of  gypsum.       - 83 - 5.9. Nitrogen 
In view of high N requirements of crops and the low levels of available-N in many soils, N is the most important nutrient in agriculture. Monitoring N fertilizer dynamics in soils is also important from the environmental perspective, as Nitrate is one of major pollutants of Groundwater, river water, lakes etc. Nitrogen in soils occurs in many forms, it is either organic or inorganically bound. 
With increasing aridity, organic and total soils N tend to decrease. 
The organic fraction constitutes the majority of total N in soils (usually >95 %). It is composed mostly of plant and microbial remains, in variable composition. The inorganic phase of soil N is composed of ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and-very little though-nitrite (NO2) forms. 
Environmental (temperature and moisture) and agronomic management (fertilization, cropping, etc.) factors influence its dynamic relationship with the organic fractions and also within the inorganic forms. The NH4-N and NO3-N forms are routinely measured in soil laboratories, as they reflect the extent of mineralization, and the forms of N are taken up by plants. In the WANA region, NO3-N content in soils a good index for predicting N fertilizer need of crops. The organic-N fraction is a measure of the soil reserve of N or its capacity to release N for crop needs through mineralization. 
Thus, methods of N analysis vary depending on the N fractions or forms of interest. 
Total soil N (mainly organic) is generally measured after wet digestion using the well-known 
Kjeldahl procedure. Total inorganic N (NH4+ NO3+ NO2) is usually determined by distillation of 2 M KCl soil extract. And after distillation, NO3-N can be determined by a procedure involving chromotropic acid. 5.9.1. Kjeldahl Nitrogen 
This procedure involves digestion and distillation. The soil is digested in concentrated H2SO4 with a catalyst mixture to raise the boiling temperature and to promote the conversion from organic-N to 
NH4-N. The NH4-N from the digest is obtained by steam distillation, using excess NaOH to raise the pH. The distillate is collected in saturated H3BO3, and then titrated with dilute H2SO4 to pH 5.0.The method determines ammonium-N, most of the organic-N forms, and a variable fraction of nitrate-N in soil. For most soils, the Kjeldahl procedure is a good estimate of total soil N content. If desired, nitrate-N can be included through the reduced iron or salicylic acid modifications of the Kjeldahl procedure (see following section). Apparatus Distillation unit Block-digester

Procedure  A. Digestion 1. Weigh 1 g air-dry soil (0.15 mm) into a 100-mL calibrated digestion tube. 2. Add about 5.0-5.5 g catalyst mixture, a few pumice boiling granules, 15 mL concentrated 
H2SO4 (in the fume hood), and swirl carefully. Place a glass funnel in the neck of the tube, and then place tubes in the rack, and leave overnight. 3. Place the tubes rack in the block-digester and slowly increase temperature setting to about 370 °C. The H2SO4 should condense about half-way up the tube neck; and when solution clears, continue heating for about 3 hours. 4. Lift the tubes rack out of the block-digester, carefully place on a rack holder, and let tubes cool to room temperature. 5. Slowly add about 15 mL DI water to the tubes, cool, and bring to volume. If tube contents are solidified and do not dissolve, heat the tubes again until the precipitate (gypsum) dissolves, then cool with tap water. 6. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (no soil), and one chemical standard (no soil, 1 mL of the Stock Solution). 
B. Distillation 1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL, if not; titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                                
Block digester    - 86 - 3. Carry out distillations as follows:  Dispense 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Pipette 10-mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask, and add 10 mL 10 N NaOH solution.  Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lower the dish to allow distillate to drain freely into the dish.  After 4 minutes when about 35-mL distillate is collected, turn off the steam supply, and wash tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.   Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto-Titrator.  Each distillation should contain at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks). 
Recovery of NH4-N should be at least 96 %.  
Notes  After finishing titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish.  Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 second.

Technical Remarks 1. The block-digester may be insulated with an asbestos shield to obtain a more uniform temperature distribution. 2. Add 3 mL concentrated H2SO4 to DI water in the sound bottom flask in the heating mantle to trap any NH3 present. Also, add Teflon Boiling Chips to ensure smooth boiling. 3. The precision of the method depends upon complete conversion of organic N into NH4- N, the digestion temperature and time, solid: acid ratio and the type of catalyst used. 4. The ideal temperature for digestion is 320-370 oC. At lower temperature, the digestion may not be complete, while above 410 o C, loss of NH3 may occur. 5. The catalysts (the mixture of CuSO4 or Se) are used to hasten the digestion process. 
Potassium sulfate is added to raise the boiling point of the acid so that loss of acid by volatilization is prevented. 6. Check all the joints of the Kjeldahl apparatus to prevent any leakage and loss of NH3. 7. Hot Kjeldahl flasks should neither be washed immediately with cold water nor allowed to cool for long to avoid deposits that settle at the bottom and are difficult to remove. 8. Where frothing occurs and passes through to the boric acid, such samples should be discarded and a fresh distillation done. 9. Opening NH3 bottles in the laboratory should be strictly prohibited while distillation is on. 
The titration should be carried out in NH4-free atmosphere. 10. When the titration is not carried out immediately, the distillate should be stored in   NH4-free cupboards after tightly stoppering the flasks.  5.9.2. Total Nitrogen 
The difference between Kjeldahl-N and total-N in soil is normally very small, due mainly to the presence of NO3-N in the total-N determination. In the following procedure, NO3-N fraction (present in the soil) is reduced and subsequently included in the distillation (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982; Buresh et al., 1982). Reagents

This solution contains 1.2 g NH4-N / L (Stock Solution). Procedure  
A. Pre-treatment  1. Mix and spread the finely ground soil sample (0.15 mm) in a thin layer on a sheet of paper until it looks uniform. 2. Take a representative soil sample, which contains about 3 to 8 mg N, by withdrawing 10 small portions from the soil sample, e.g., 10 g.   
B. Digestion 1. Weigh 0.5 g air-dry soil (0.15 mm) and place into a 250-mL calibrated digestion tube.  2. Determine moisture on soil sub-samples to express results on a dry-weight basis. 3. Add 10 mL DI water to each tube and swirl thoroughly to wet the soil. Allow wet soil to stand for 30 minutes. 4. Prepare a blank digest, weigh 0.1 g EDTA standard digest (accurately weighed to 0.1 mg) with each batch.  5. Add 10 mL potassium permanganate solution, swirl well, allow to stand for 30 second, then hold the digestion tube at 45 ° angle and slowly add 20 mL 50 % H2SO4 in a manner which washes down material adhering to the tube neck. 6. Allow to stand for 15 minutes, and then swirl well. Do not swirl digestion tube immediately after adding acid because this may result in excessive frothing.  7. Add 2 drops N-octyl alcohol solution.  8. Add a few pumice boiling granules to the blank, EDTA, and sample digest tubes.     - 89 - 9. Add 2.5 g reduced iron through a long-stem funnel and immediately place a 5-cm (ID) glass funnel (with stem removed) in the tube neck, and swirl.  10. Excessive frothing at this stage may be halted by pouring 5 mL DI water through the 5-cm glass funnel; do not swirl.  11. Allow the tubes to stand overnight. 12. Pre-digest the samples by placing them on the cold block and heating at 100 °C for 1 hour. 
The block digester comes to 100 °C within 15 minutes; therefore, total time on the block digester will be approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes. 13. Samples should be swirled at 45 minutes. 14. Remove tubes from the block-digester, and cool. Rapid cooling may be affected in tap water.  15. Leave overnight. 16. Add about 5 g catalyst mixture through a long stem funnel. Then add 25 mL concentrated 
H2SO4 to each tube, and swirl (more acid may be required if larger amount of soil is used).  17. Place the tubes back on the block-digester pre-heated to 100 °C, increase the block temperature setting to 240 °C, and remove the funnels.  18. Arrange funnels systematically in an order so that they may afterwards be placed into the same digestion tube. It takes 40 minutes to reach 240 °C.  19. Continue boiling off the water for 1 hour after reaching 240 °C. 20. After the water has been removed, replace the funnels and raise the temperature to 380 °C.  21. Set the timer on the block-digester, and digest for 4 hours at this temperature. 22. Remove the tubes from the block-digester, add about 50 mL DI water, and mix using a vortex mixture. If any solid precipitate remains in the tubes, break it up with a glass rod.  23. After cooling, add DI water to the 250-mL mark.   
C. Distillation 1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL, if not; titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                              3. Carry out distillations as follows:  Dispense 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Prior to distillation, shake the digestion tube to mix thoroughly its contents.  Pipette 50 mL soil digestion into a 250-mL distillation flask and carefully add 25 mL 10 N 
NaOH down the side of the flask, while holding the distillation flask containing the digest at a 50 ° angle.   Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lower the dish to allow distillate to drain freely into the dish.   After 4 minutes, when 35 mL distillate is collected, turn off the steam supply, and wash tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.      - 90 -  The first appearance of distillate will be delayed when large aliquots are used. The distillation time should always be 4 minutes from the first appearance of distillate flow.  Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto-Titrator.  Each distillation should contain at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks).  
Recovery of NH4-N should be at least 96 %.  
Notes:   After finishing titration, the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip and the combined electrode wash into the dish.  Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to distillation unit, and place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 second.

Nitrogen is absorbed by plant roots in two forms, NH4-N and NO3-N. Ammonium ions are produced in soils through breakdown of OM, manures, or urea or ammonium-containing fertilizer. Nitrate ions are the final form of N breakdown/reactions (excluding gaseous forms of N). It can also be supplied to soil by fertilizers.  
Nitrogen can be lost from the soil in several ways; i.e., volatilization, anaerobic de-nitrification and leaching. Normally, NH4 does not leach from soil because the positive charge is attracted and “held” by the negative (-) charge present on the surface of clay and humus particles. However, when 
NH4 is transformed to NO3 the positive (+) charge is lost and the soil no longer attracts the available N – unless positive charges are present (Anion exchange capacity). Water percolating through a soil profile may leach and deplete the mobile NO3 from the upper layers to the lower layers and even into the groundwater if leaching is excessive. Excessive NO3 leaching is often the consequence of inadequate N-fertilizer management.    - 91 -  Nitrate is highly soluble in water, and a number of solutions including water have been used as extractants. Exchangeable NH4 can be extracted at room temperature with a neutral K salt solution. 
Various extractants at different molarities have been used, such as 0.05M K2SO4, 0.1M KCl, 1M KCl, and 2M KCl. 
At ICARDA, mineral-N is determined using 2M KCl as the extracting solution in a 1:5 (soil: water) ratio. Ammonium and NO3 plus nitrite (NO2) are determined by steam distillation of ammonia (NH3), using heavy MgO for NH4 and Devarda’s Alloy for NO3 (Bremner and Keeney, 1965). The distillate is collected in saturated H3BO3 and titrated to pH 5.0 with dilute H2SO4. This method determines dissolved and adsorbed forms of NH4, NO3 and NO2 in soils. The sum determined by this method is referred to as Mineral-N (Keeney and Nelson, 1982; Buresh, et al., 1982). 
Field-fresh soil samples are to be preferred over air-dried or oven-dried soil samples, as the process of drying may alter the concentrations of NH4 and NO3 (see for instance Frye and Hutcheson 1981, Soil Sci. Soc. Am. J.).  Soil samples may be stored in the fridge for a few days until analysis.  Apparatus Distillation unit

Filter the NO3-N suspensions using Whatman No. 42 filter paper, and leave the NH4-N suspensions flask for at least 1 hour until the soil is precipitated.  
B. Distillation 1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not; titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                              3. Carry out distillations as follows: 
To determine NH4-N:  Pipette 20-mL an aliquot of 2 M KCl soil extract into a 100-mL distillation flask.  Pipette 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 50-mL Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker, which is placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Add about 0.2 g heavy MgO, with a calibrated spoon, to the distillation flask.   Immediately, attach the distillation flask to the distillation unit with a clamp.  Start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, then lower the dish to allow distillate to drain freely into the Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker.  After 4 minutes, when 35-mL distillate or more is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask.  Each distillation should contain at least two standards (pipette 20 mL 1.2 mg NH4-N from 
Diluted Stock Solution) and two blanks (pipette 20 mL 2 M KCl).  Recovery of NH4-N should be at least 96 %.      - 93 - 
To determine NO3-N and NO2-N:  Pipette 20-mL an aliquot of DI water soil extract into a 100-mL distillation flask.  Pipette another 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 50-mL Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker, which is placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Add about 0.2 g heavy MgO and 0.2 g Devarda’s alloy, with a calibrated spoon, to the distillation flask.    Immediately, attach the distillation flask to the distillation unit with a clamp.  Start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, then lower the dish to allow distillate to drain freely into the Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker.  After 4 minutes, when 35-mL distillate or more is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask.  Wash tip of the condenser into Pyrex evaporating dish or the beaker with a small amount of DI water.   Each distillation should contain at least two standards (pipette 20 mL 1.2 mg NO3-N from 
Diluted Stock Solution) and two blanks (pipette 20 mL DI water).  Recovery of NO3-N should be at least 96 %. C. Titration  
Titrate the both distillates, separately, to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto-Titrator. 
Notes  After finishing titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish.  To determine NO3-N (plus NO2-N) in the same extract, add 0.2 g Devarda’s alloy with a calibrated spoon to the same distillation flask.   Attach flask to distillation unit with a clamp, and start distilling. Proceed as for NH4-N.  Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect distillation flasks containing the KCl extracts, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to distillation unit, and place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds. 
Steaming out is done only between different samples, not between NH4-N (determined by 
MgO), and NO3-N (by Devarda’s alloy) in the same sample.

Technical Remarks 1. In some laboratories, a 1:3 (soil: solution) extract is used for Mineral-N determination. For soils in northwest Syria, a 1:5 extract gives a higher recovery of NH4-N than a 1:3 extract. 2. For determination of NO3-N in calcareous soils, we recommend using de-ionized water as the extracting solution, because carbonates dissolve in the KCl solution and some CO2 may be collected in the H3BO3 during distillation. This causes a negative interference with NO3-N determination in KCl extract. 3. Often there is confusion about the relationship between NO3 and NO3-N. The nitrate ion is a combination of one N atom and three O2 atoms. The total mass of NO3 is 14 + 48 = 62. So, in 62 g NO3 contains. 14 g N and 48 g O2. This relationship can be expressed in two ways, either as 62 g NO3  or as 14 g NO3-N. Both expressions are correct. Since 62/14 = 4.43, one can convert NO3 measurement to actual N concentration. For example, 10 ppm NO3-N can be expressed as 10 × 4.43 or 44.3 ppm NO3. Both values indicate the same concentration, in two different formats. 4. Errors caused by NH4 and NO3 contamination from filter paper can be significant. 5. In samples low in NH4 and NO3 (such as those from deeper mineral soil horizons) the soil-to solution ratio could be decreased to obtain detectable amounts of NH4 and NO3. 5.9.4. Nitrate-Nitrogen (by chromotropic acid) 
Nitrate-N is measured by a spectrophotometric method (using chromotropic acid), which is quite rapid, used originally for water and later for soils. It is an alternate for NO3-N determination by the distillation method. A close relationship exists between NO3-N determined by chromotropic acid and distillation method. Apparatus

Microbial biomass as determined by the fumigation/incubation technique subjects a fresh soil to chloroform fumigation which causes cell walls to lyse and denature and the cellular contents become extractable in 0.5 M K2SO4. This is not a measure of soil microbial activity because no differentiation is made between quiescent and active organisms or between different classes of microorganisms. Care must be exercised when comparing soils from different locations as microbial biomass fluctuates greatly within a single soil in response to litter inputs, moisture availability and temperature. If different agricultural soils are being compared at a single time, the fresh soils should be at or near moisture holding capacity. If soils from different ecosystems are being compared, samples should be collected toward the middle of the wet and dry seasons. The following procedure is based on that of 
Anderson and Ingram (1993), and taken from Okalebo et al. (1993). Apparatus Block-digester Calibrated digestion tubes Distillation unit

Procedure 1. Weigh duplicate 30 g fresh soil samples into a 100-mL beaker.  2. Determine moisture on soil sub-samples to express results on a dry-weight basis. 3. Place the beakers into two desiccators. The first desiccator contains fumigated control samples. Place a 100-mL beaker containing 50 mL CHCl3 (add pumice boiling granules to the 
CHCl3 to assist rapid volatilization of the chloroform) into the center of the desiccator.  4. The second desiccator contains non-fumigated control samples, which apart from fumigation-evacuation to be handled in the same fashion. Close the lids of the desiccators, paying particular attention that the sealant is uniformly distributed (Figure. 7). 5. Apply vacuum to the fumigated treatment until the chloroform is rapidly boiling. Evacuate the fumigated treatments using a vacuum pump repeatedly (8 – 12 times).  6. Close the desiccator and store under darkened conditions for 72 hours at room temperature. 7. Open the desiccators; release the CHCl3 vapor under the fume hood, and transfer the fumigated/non-fumigated soil samples to 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks. 8.  Add 100 mL 0.5 M K2SO4 solution. Shake on an orbital shaker for 1 hour. 9. To obtain a clear extract, filter the soil suspensions using Whatman No. 42 filter paper or a centrifuge. 
Remember:  The chloroform is being trapped by the oil in the vacuum pump; so the oil must be changed more often than normal. Alternatively, chloroform can be trapped by a cooling finger to prevent contamination of the vacuum oil. It is not necessary to evacuate the control desiccator. 1. Determination of Nitrogen 
A. Digestion  1. Pipette 50 mL soils extract into a 250-mL calibrated digestion tube, and add 1 mL 0.2 M 
CuSO4.5H2O solution. 2. Add 10 mL concentrated H2SO4, and a few pumice boiling granules, and then place the tubes in the rack. 3. Place the tubes rack in the block-digester and increase the temperature setting to 150 °C, to remove extra water.  4. Increase the temperature slowly to reach to 380 °C, and digest for 3 hours. 5. Carefully lifts the tubes rack out of the block-digester, let tubes cool to room temperature, and bring to volume with DI water. 6. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one blank (no soil), and one EDTA standard (0.1g EDTA accurately weighed to 0.1 mg). 
B. Distillation 1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.     - 98 - 2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not, titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                              3. Carry out distillations as follows:  Dispense 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Pipette 50 mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask, and add 15 mL 10 N NaOH solution.  Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lower the dish to allow distillate to drain freely into the dish.  After 4 minutes when about 35-mL distillate is collected, turn off the steam supply, and wash tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.   Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto-Titrator.  Each distillation should contain at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks).  
Recovery of digested EDTA should be at least 96 %.  
Notes:  After finishing titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish. Between different samples, steam out the distillations.

Technical Remarks 1. Some authors suggest that empirically derived correction factors should be applied to these results. These factors may be obtained by conducting the fumigation/extraction procedure on inert soils containing a known quantity of microbial biomass (e.g., mushrooms or washed bacterial cells). Vance et al. (1987) advocate a factor of 2.64 for microbial biomass, while 
Brookes et al. (1985) recommend a factor of 1.46 for biomass N. If these factors are applied, this should be clearly indicated when reporting the results. Because of the large variation in soil microbial (and micro-faunal) populations in soils, it is suggested that these factors may not be applied.      - 100 - 2. The fumigation is done in a desiccators lined with paper or tissue. Place the beakers with soil (after pre-incubating for 1- week) in the desiccators, together with a beaker containing 20 mL ethanol-free CHCl3 and a few anti-bumping granules.            5.10. Phosphorus 5.10.1. Extractable Phosphorus 
Because of its significance as a major nutrient, coupled with the fact that it is widely deficient in alkaline-calcareous soils, phosphorus (P) is measured in virtually all soil laboratories of the WANA regions. Compared to N and most other nutrients, soil tests for P are generally fairly reliable in predicting the need for P fertilizer for growing field crops. Since P compounds in soils are highly variable and are related to soil type or parent material, several extractants are used worldwide for evaluating soil fertility. Few, if any, of these procedures, are satisfactory for all soil types. Even a good test must be well correlated with crop P uptake and must be calibrated to crop response to fertilizer application in field situations.  
The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO3) procedure of Olsen et al. (1954) is generally accepted as a suitable index of P “availability” for alkaline soils; where the solubility of calcium phosphate is increased because of the precipitation of Ca as CaCO3. Field research has confirmed its usefulness in the WANA region since the region’s soils are mainly calcareous (Ryan and Matar, 1990; 1992). 
Consequently, this soil test has been adapted for routine use almost in all laboratories of the region. 
The original CuSO4.5H2O method, developed and described by Olsen et al. (1954) involved the use of Carbon Black in the extraction reagent to eliminate the color (because of soil OM) in the extract. 
The procedure was, however, modified later, eliminating the use of Carbon Black (Murphy and Riley, 1962; Watanabe and Olsen, 1965; Olsen and Sommers, 1982). In the modified method, a single solution reagent containing ammonium molybdate, ascorbic acid and a small amount of antimony is used for color development in the soil extracts.

A. Extraction 1. Weigh 5 g air-dry soil (2-mm) into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask; add 100 mL 0.5 M NaHCO3 solution. 2. Close the flask with a rubber stopper, and shake for 30 minutes on a shaker at 200 – 300 rpm.

B. Measurement 1. Pipette 10 mL clear filtrate into a 50-mL flask.  2. Add the required acid to all the unknown solutions (adding 1 mL 5 N H2SO4 is adequate to acidify each 10 mL NaHCO3 extract to pH 5).

Technical Remarks 1. The amount of P extracted from a soil depends on pre-treatment of samples, shaking frequency and time, and on temperature during extraction. Therefore, sample treatment and the conditions during extraction should be standardized. 2. If the sample solutions are too dark-colored for measurement against the highest standard, a smaller soil extract aliquot should be taken, and the calculation modified accordingly. Once the blue color has developed, the solution cannot be diluted. 3. Intensity of blue color changes slightly with every batch of molybdate reagent. Check the standard curve every day by using 2 or 3 dilutions of the standard P solution. If the standard curve is not the same as before, draw a new standard curve with fresh molybdate reagent. 
The intensity of blue color changes slightly with every batch of molybdate reagent.  4. Glassware used in P analysis should not be washed with detergents containing P (most detergents contain P).  5. As glass tube density may vary, it is best to use the same tube (cuvette) for each absorbance reading on a spectrophotometer. 6. If AB-DTPA test (described at Section 5.18.2) is used for evaluating micronutrient status of the soil, then P can also be determined in the same extract. The beauty of this ‘universal’ test for alkaline soils is that macronutrients (NO3-N, P, and K) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, and 
Cu) can be determined in a single extract. 7. Color is stable for 24 hours. 8. Dissolved organic matter does not interfere with the method. 9. If glass container is used to store extracting solution, pH tends to increase with time, resulting in higher values for extractable P. 10. In general, the Bray P-1 method extracts about the same amount P as the Olsen method in the low range, and more in the medium and high ranges, except on highly calcareous soils, where it extracts less P. 11. The most commonly used methods for determination of available P in soils are Bray’s method for acidic soils and Olsen’s method for neutral and calcareous/alkaline soils.             - 104 - 5.10.2. Total Phosphorus 
The “plant-available P” fraction is normally a small proportion of total P. Total P measurement involves digestion of a soil sample with a strong acid and the dissolution of all insoluble inorganic and organic P forms of minerals. This measurement is usually employed only for soil genesis or mineralogical studies (Olsen and Sommers, 1982). Apparatus

Organic Phosphorus (P) content in soils, by the Ignition Method, is estimated by igniting the soil at 550 °C. Simultaneously, inorganic P in the soil is estimated by extracting with 1 N sulfuric acid. Later, the organic P content in the soil is calculated by subtracting P in the unignited sample from P in the ignited sample.  Apparatus

V1 = Volume of extract used for measurement (mL) 
V2 = Volume of flask used for measurement (mL)    - 108 - 5.11. Potassium 
Along with N and P, potassium (K) is also of vital importance in crop production. Most soils contain relatively large amounts of total K (1 – 2 %) as components of relatively insoluble minerals. However, only a small fraction (about 1%) is present in forms available to plants, i.e., water-soluble and exchangeable-K. The highly weathered acid soils (of tropical regions) are more frequently deficient in plant available K, whereas soils arid and semi-arid areas tend to be well supplied with K. Thus, soils of the WANA region are generally adequate in K. A possible exception is sandy soils and irrigated soils grown to high K-requiring crops, e.g., sugar beet and potatoes.  
The determination of plant available-K is complicated as, in addition to K soluble in water, it includes part of the exchangeable-K. Another factor which complicates the determination of plant available-K in arid and semi-arid regions is that extracting solutions used for exchangeable-K may also extract part of the extractable-K from K-aluminum silicate clay minerals, i.e., K-feldspars and micas, which is not readily available.  The moisture content of the soil sample and the method of drying the sample also affect K extractability. Nevertheless, extractable-K, or exchangeable plus water-soluble K, is often considered the plant-available fraction and is routinely measured in the region’s laboratories. Water-soluble K tends to be a large proportion of the extractable K fraction in drier-region soils. Where extractable-K values are less than 100 to 150 ppm, K deficiency is likely and fertilization is required to maximize crop production. 
With irrigation or high K-requiring crops, the critical level should be even higher. 5.11.1. Extractable Potassium 
This fraction of soil K is the sum of water-soluble and exchangeable K. The method uses a neutral ammonium acetate solution (1 N) to replace the cations present on the soil exchange complex. This is considered as plant available K in the soils, and is commonly measured by the flame photometer. 
However, the cation concentrations determined by this method are referred to as “exchangeable” for non-calcareous soils. For calcareous soils, the cations are referred to as “exchangeable plus soluble”. Apparatus

This fraction is a measure of the amount of K extracted from the soil by water (can be obtained in a water extract from a saturated paste as for Electrical Conductivity (EC).  Procedure 
A. Extraction 1. Soluble K can be obtained in a water extract from a saturated paste as for pH and EC determinations. 2. Filter suspension using a Whatman No.1 filter paper to exclude any soil particles.

Calculation                                                5.11.3. Exchangeable Potassium 
Exchangeable-K, or that held on the exchange sites or surfaces of clay minerals, is normally the dominant portion of total extractable K. It can be deduced by difference:                                            –                  
Technical Remarks 1. Exchangeable Na, Ca and Mg can be measured in the same way as derived for exchangeable K. 
Extractable-Na, Ca, and Mg are measured in the NH4OAc extract and soluble Na, Ca, and Mg  in the water extract (saturated paste). The difference represents exchangeable Na, Ca, and Mg.  2. After extraction, the filtrate containing K, Mg, Ca, and Na should not be stored for longer than 24 hours unless refrigerated or treated to prevent bacterial growth. 3. Soils can be stored in an air-dry condition for several months without any effect on the exchangeable K, Na, Ca, and Mg content. 4. Standard Solutions for measuring soluble-K should be prepared in DI water, but for measuring extractable-K the standards should be made in NH4OAc solution. 5. The routine laboratory tests for determining plant available-K do not reflect the true situation under field conditions, because of the variation in the clay mineralogy of the soils. 6. Available K in soils is mainly in the water-soluble and exchangeable-fractions, and constitutes only a small part (not more than1%) of total K in soils.    - 111 - 5.12. Sodium  
Sodium (Na) can be extracted with ammonium acetate solution in the same way as K, while soluble-Na can be obtained in a water extract obtained from a saturated paste as for EC. Subsequently, Na in the extract can be determined by flame photometry, where Na emits a sparkling yellowish-red color. 5.12.1. Extractable Sodium Reagents

Exchangeable Na, or that held on the exchange sites or surfaces of clay minerals, is normally the dominant portion of total extractable Na. It can be detected by difference:                                            –                   5.13. Calcium and Magnesium 
Exchangeable Ca and Mg are usually determined in a neutral normal ammonium acetate extract of soil. 
Soluble Ca and Mg are obtained by extracting the soil by water or from a saturated paste as for pH and 
EC. Extraction is carried out by shaking the soil: extractant mixture followed by filtration or centrifugation, and measurement of their concentrations in the extract by titration with EDTA.  The EDTA titration method is preferred on account of its accuracy, simplicity and speed. However, 
Ca and Mg in the extracts can also be measured by atomic absorption spectrophotometer after the removal of ammonium acetate and organic matter. 5.13.1. Extractable Calcium and Magnesium 
The method is based on the principle that calcium, magnesium and a number of other cations form stable complexes with versenate (ethylendiaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt, EDTA) at different pH. A known volume of standard calcium solution is titrated with standard 0.01N EDTA solution using Murexid (ammonium purpurate) indicator in the presence of NaOH solution.   
The end point is a change of color from orange red to purple at pH 12 when the whole of Ca forms a complex with EDTA. Calcium plus Mg are also present in the solution and can be titrated with 0.01N 
EDTA using buffer solution and a few drops Eriochrome Black T indicator. The end point is a change of color from red to blue at pH 10. Beyond pH 10, magnesium is not bound strongly to Erichrome Black-T indicator to give a distinct end point. Reagents

F. Ammonium Acetate Solution (NH4OAc), 1 N  Add 57 mL concentrated acetic acid (CH3COOH) solution to 800 mL DI water, and then add 68 mL concentrated ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) solution, mix well, and let the mixture cool.   Adjust to pH 7.0 by adding more CH3COOH or NH4OH, and bring to 1-L volume with DI water.

Technical Remarks 1. Normality with Ca determination usually is 3 to 5% higher than with Ca + Mg. 2. If there is not enough saturation extract, a soil- water suspension (ratio 1:5) can be prepared. 
Shake for 30 minutes, filter, and use filtrate for analysis. 3. If an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer is used, a small aliquot of the saturation extract is sufficient to determine Ca and Mg. 4. The interference of Cu, Zn, Fe, and Mn is prevented by the use of 2 % NaCN solution or carbonate. In irrigation waters and water extracts of soil, the quantities of interfering ions are negligible and can be neglected. 5.14. Carbonate and Bicarbonate 
Carbonate (CO3) and bicarbonate (HCO3) ions are species of the same acid, carbonic acid. Their proportionate content is a function of pH. The CO3 starts to form as pH rises above 8.4. Carbonate and bicarbonate are generally determined in soil saturation extract by titration with 0.01 N H2SO4 to pH 8.3 and 4.5, respectively.                                         –                - 117 - Reagents

N = Normality of H2SO4 solution Technical Remark 
Carbonate and bicarbonate should be determined soon after preparing extracts because CaCO3 precipitates on standing. If other analyses (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl, and SO4) cannot be performed immediately, refrigerate the extracts. 5.15. Chloride  
Soluble chloride (Cl) is obtained in the saturation extract (as prepared for soluble Ca, Mg and anions), and its concentration in the extract is determined by silver nitrate titration. This method quantifies the concentration of Cl (meq/L) in the saturation paste extract. Chloride may be determined using anion selective electrode (potentiometric). Plant tolerance to Cl can be related to its concentration in the soil saturation paste extract. The method detection limit is approximately 0.1 meq/L, dependent on the method of analysis, and is generally reproducible within ± 10 %.  Reagents

Technical Remarks 1. Clean all glassware prior to analysis. Wash all glassware with 0.2 N HNO3 and wash by DI water.  2. Samples containing Cl concentrations greater than the highest standard will require dilution.      - 120 - 5.16. Sulfate 
Sulfur (S) is present in soils in organic and inorganic forms. Organic S is an important constituent of proteins and amino acids. The major inorganic sources of S include gypsum (CaSO4), and pyrite (Fe2S). 
Sulfur is added to soil as fertilizers containing S, such as K2SO4 and some pesticides. It exists in soil and soil solution mainly as the sulfate (SO4-S) anion in combination with the cations Ca, Mg, K, Na or NH4.  
Phosphate ions (as monacalcium phosphate) are generally preferred for replacement of the adsorbed 
SO4 ions. The extraction is also carried out using CaCl2 solution. However, the former is considered to be better for more efficient replacement of SO4 ions.  
Under aerobic condition, the form of elemental S is oxidized to form SO4 and under anaerobic condition, elemental SO4 is reduced by microorganisms into SO3 and S; waterlogged or paddy soils, especially in swamps, provide a suitable environment for the formation of hydrogen sulphide (H2S). 
The total S content in soils varies widely from soil to soil. Sandy soils in the humid regions are generally low in S (0.002%). In contrast, soils in arid regions may contain 5% SO4-S. Plants absorb S mostly in the SO4 form, which is the available form of S. Sulfate is extractable by water, NaCl, CaCl2, 
NH4OAc, NaHCO3 and Ca (H2PO4)2 solutions.  5.16.1. Precipitation Method

Put beakers on a hotplate, heat to boiling, then add 10 mL 1 N BaCl2.2H2O solution in excess to precipitate SO4 as barium sulfate.    - 121 - 4. Boil for 5 to 10 minutes, cover with a watch-glass, and leave to cool.  5. Filter solution through ashless filter paper, collect the barium sulfate precipitate on the filter paper, and then wash it several times with warm DI water until no trace of Cl remains. The presence of Cl in the filtrate can be checked by AgNO3 solution.  6.

The commonly used method for S determination in alkaline soils is the extraction of SO4-S with 0.15% 
CaCl2.2H2O and measurement of SO4-S concentration in the extracts by a turbidimetric procedure using barium chloride. A critical range of 10-13 mg/kg CaCl2-extractable SO4-S has commonly been reported for cereal (e.g., wheat, maize), oilseed (e.g., mustard), and crops (Tandon, 1991). Apparatus Mechanical shaker, reciprocal

E. Standard Stock Solution   Dissolve 0.5434 g potassium sulfate (K2SO4) in DI water, and bring to 1-L volume. This solution contains 100 ppm SO4-S (Stock Solution).   Prepare a series of Standard Solutions from the Stock Solution as follows:  Dilute 5, 10, 20, 30, 40, and 50 mL Stock Solution to 100-mL numbered flasks by adding 0.15 % calcium chloride dihydrate solution, and then bring to volume. These standards contain 5, 10, 20, 30, 40 and 50 ppm SO4-S, respectively. Procedure 
A. Extraction 1. Weigh 5 g air-dry soil (2-mm) into a 150-mL Erlenmeyer flask.  2. Add 25 mL 0.15% CaCl2.2H2O solution (do not use a rubber stopper, or wrap the rubber stopper in thin polyethylene. Errors result from gradual oxidation of S compounds present in the stopper). 3. Shake for 30 minutes on a reciprocal shaker (180+ oscillations per minute). 4. Filter the suspension through Whatman No. 42 filter paper. This procedure yields almost colorless extracts.   B. Measurement  1. Pipette 10-mL aliquot of the extract into a 50-mL test tube, or a smaller aliquot diluted to 10 mL with DI water. 2. Add 1 mL 6 M HCl solution followed by 5 mL 70 % sorbitol solution from a pipette with an enlarged jet. 3. Add about 1 g BaCl2.2H2O crystals (using a measuring spoon). 4. Shake vigorously (on a test tube shaker for 30 seconds) to dissolve the BaCl2.2H2O and obtain a uniform suspension. 5. Prepare a standard curve as follows:  Pipette 10 mL of each standard (0 – 50 ppm), and proceed as for the samples.  Also make a blank with 10 mL 0.15 % CaCl2.2H2O solution, and proceed as for the samples.     - 123 - 6. Read the absorbance (turbidity) of the blank, standards, and samples on the 
Spectrophotometer at 470-nm wavelength.  7. Prepare a calibration curve for standards, plotting absorbance against the respective SO4-S concentrations. 8. Read SO4-S concentration in the unknown samples from the calibration curve. 
Calculation                                                                 Where:     
V = Total volume of the soil extract (mL) 
Wt = Weight of air-dry soil (g) 
Technical Remarks 1. Do not let the standards and unknowns (soil extracts) stand for longer than 2-3 minutes, otherwise re-shake the suspension before spectrophotometric reading.  2. Allow about the same time to standards and unknowns between shaking and turbidimetric reading. 3. Use of Ca salts has a distinct advantage over those of Na or K as Ca prevents deflocculating in heavy textured soils and leads to easy filtration. The SO4 in the extract can be estimated turbidimetrically using a spectrophotometer. When the amount of extracted S is too low to be measured, add a solution of known S concentration to the extract to raise the concentration to easily detectable level. 4. Soils rich in iron, hydrogen sulfide (H2S) usually precipitate as Pyrite (Fe2S), which imparts a black color to the soil.  5. Accumulate of the H2S in soils, it is not only toxic to soil organisms, but also it creates environmental problems. Some bacteria present in soils are capable of oxidizing the H2S into elemental S and SO4.       - 124 - 5.17. Boron  5.17.1. Hot-Water Method 
Boron (B) is a non-metal, in contrast to the other micronutrient elements. Boron is present in small amounts in igneous, sedimentary and metamorphic rocks. It is an essential micronutrient element for plant growth (needed for cell division), hence for the growth of young shoots. Boron in soils is primarily of importance in soil fertility and plant nutrition.The major inorganic sources of B are borate and boron-silicate minerals. Borate minerals occur mostly in arid regions and are formed by the evaporation of water in enclosed salt-water lakes and basins in arid regions.  
The hot-water extraction procedure, introduced by Berger and Truog (1939), modified later is still the most popular method for measuring “available” soil B or the fraction of B related to plant growth in alkaline soils. Water soluble B, the available form of B, is extracted from the soil by water suspension. 
Boron in soil extracts is measured calorimetrically using reagent Azomethine-H (Bingham, 1982). Also, B can be analyzed by colorimetric methods using reagents such as Carmine, and most recently by 
Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and Atomic Emission Spectrometry. The colorimetric method, using reagent Azomethine-H, is preferable because the use of AAS poses some limitations as B is not a metal.  
Where soil B levels are less than 0.5 ppm, deficiency is likely to occur for most crops. However, where levels are greater than about 5 ppm, toxicity may occur. The normal B concentration in plant tissue is reported to be between 20 and 100 μg/mg dry matter of mature leaves. It is essential in sugar translocation and in the synthesis of hormones and protein in plants.  Apparatus

B. Activated Charcoal (Boron - free) 
This is prepared by giving repeated washings (8 – 9 times) of DI water (boiling charcoal with water in 1:5 ratio), and subsequent filtering. Boron in the filtrate is checked by Azomethine-H color development. Continue washing until it is B-free.

A. Extraction 1. Weigh 10 g air-dry soil (2-mm) into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask (Pyrex). 2. Add about 0.2 g activated charcoal (B-free). 3. Add 20 mL DI water. 4. Boil on a hot plate for 5 minutes with flask covered by a watch glass. 5. Filter the suspension immediately through Whatman No. 40 filter paper.

V = Total volume of the soil extract (mL) 
Wt= Weight of air-dry soil (g) 
Technical Remarks 1. Use of glassware should be minimal; always use concentrated HCl-treated glassware (for a week) where absolutely essential. 2. The use of Azomethine-H is an improvement over that of carmine and curcumin, since the procedure involving this chemical does not require the use of concentrated acid. 3. The amount of charcoal added may vary with the OM content of the soil and should be just sufficient to produce a colorless extract after 5 minutes of boiling on a hot plate. Excess amounts of charcoal can reduce extractable B values 4. In humid regions soils, borate ions may tend to leach from soils. Therefore, soluble B concentrations are low in highly leached soils. Since highly leached soils usually exhibit low soil pH, acid soils are deficient in B. 5. In arid region soils, borate ions are usually not affected by leaching. Therefore, strongly basic in reaction, they may contain excessive amounts of B for plant growth.  6. Boron deficiency is more likely to occur in Ultisols and Oxisols, whereas B toxicity could be noted in Aridisols. This is in contrast with the other micronutrients.     - 126 - 5.17.2. Dilute Hydrochloric Acid Method  
Though the hot water extraction method (HWE) is quite popular for predicting B fertility in alkaline soils, the procedure is tedious and prone to error (because of difficulty in maintaining uniform boiling time). In an effort of having a convenient substitute, researchers (Kausar et al., 1990; Rashid et al., 1994; 
Rashid et al., 1997) have found  the dilute HCl method of Ponnamperuma et al. (1981), originally designed for acid soils, to be equally effective in diagnosing B deficiency in alkaline and calcareous soils. The HCl method is simple, economical, and more efficient. Reagents A. Buffer Solution

Wt = Weight of air-dry soil (g) 5.18. Micronutrient Cations 
Though required by plants in much smaller amounts than the major plant nutrients (e.g., N, P, K), micronutrients are nevertheless equally essential for crop growth. Solubility of micronutrient cations decreases with an increase in soil pH. As most soils of the WANA region are alkaline, micronutrient deficiencies are common and are becoming more frequent and widespread with intensification of cropping.  
The extracted elements can be estimated by various methods, which include volumetric analysis, spectrometry and atomic absorption spectroscopy. Volumetric methods such as ethylene diaminetetraacetic acid solution (EDTA) and KMnO4 titrations are used for extraction and estimation of 
Zn, Mn, and Fe, respectively. Copper can be estimated by titration with Na2S2O3.  
The Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy method is commonly used to measure of Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe. 
Running parameters that are specific to a particular model are given in the software provided with the equipment manual. Accordingly, the current supply, wavelength of hollow cathode lamp, integration time and anticipated estimation ranges are fixed. 5.18.1. DTPA Method 
The diethylene triamine pentaacetic Acid (DTPA) test of Lindsay and Norvell (1978) is commonly used for evaluating fertility status with respect to micronutrient cations, i.e., Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu. The DTPA method is an important and widely used chelating agent, which combines with free metal ions in the solution to form soluble complexes of elements. The DTPA method has a capacity to complex each of the micronutrient cations as 10 times of its atomic weight. The capacity ranges from 550 to 650 mg/kg depending upon the micronutrient cations. However, the universal soil test for alkaline soils (i.e., AB 
DTPA described in Section 5.18.2) is equally effective for determining micronutrient cations in alkaline soils. Deficiencies of Mo, Cl, Ni and Co are not known to occur in alkaline soils. Apparatus

V= Total volume of the extract (mL) 
Wt = Weight of air-dry soil (g) 
Technical Remarks 1. The theoretical basis for the DTPA extraction is the equilibrium of the metals in the soil with the chelating agent. The pH of 7.3 enables DTPA to extract Fe and other metals.  2. The DTPA reagent should be of the acid form (not a di-sodium salt). 3. To avoid excessive dissolution of CaCO3, which may release occluded micronutrients that are not available to crops in calcareous soils and may give erroneous results, the extractant is buffered in slightly alkaline pH. 4. Triethanolamine (TEA) is used as buffer because it burns clearly during atomization of extractant solution while being measured on the AAS. 5. Extracting solution can be stored for 2 weeks under mineral oil, and then the pH adjusted to 7.6 if necessary. 6. The time of shaking is important because trace elements continue to dissolve (non equilibrium extraction). Therefore, factors as shaking time, speed and shape of vessel are critical and should be standardized in every laboratory.    - 130 - 5.18.2. Ammonium Bicarbonate-DTPA Method 
The AB-DTPA is a multi-element soil test for alkaline soils developed by Soltanpour and Schwab (1977), and later modified by Soltanpour and Workman (1979) to omit the use of carbon black. The extracting solution is 1 M in the ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3), and 0.005 M DTPA adjusted to pH 7.6, NO3-N, 
P, and K can also be determined in the same extract. This method is highly correlated with sodium bicarbonate method for P, ammonium acetate method for K, and DTPA method for Zn, Fe, Mn and Cu.

The heavy metals of concern in agriculture, especially as it relates to the environment are Cadmium (Cd), 
Lead (Pb), Mercury (Hg), Chromium (Cr), Selenium (Se), Nickel (Ni), as well as Cobalt (Co), Molybdenum (Mo), and Arsenic (As). For the release of mineral elements from soil and sediments, wet oxidation of sample is carried out. Wet oxidation employs oxidizing acids (e.g., HNO3-HClO4-HF tri acid mixture or 
HNO3-HClO4 di-acid mixture). The di-acid oxidation method is easier, less time-consuming and convenient but it is not a total digestion as soil does not dissolve completely, particularly silicate minerals, therefore, di-acid digestion is known as pseudo digestion or partial digestion. 5.19.1.

If tube contents are solidified and do not dissolve, heat the tubes again until the precipitate (gypsum) dissolves. Then cool with tap water. 5.20. Soluble Silicon 
Soluble Silicon (Si) corresponds to the amount of Si available in soil solution. It is the most labile form of 
Si and consists primarily of monomeric silica acid (H3SiO4). Extraction with 0.01 M CaCl2 solution provides for low interference of the method with high levels of CaCO3 in the soil. The H3SiO4 can be determined colorimetrically by reaction with molybdate; blue (this procedure) and yellow analyses methods are usually distinguished.

Note: The Silicon standard 1000 mg solution is not a 1000 ppm solution! Pipette 4 mL stock solution to 200-mL, and bring volume with DI water. This solution contains 20 ppm Si (Diluted stock solution).  
Note: This reagent should be prepared as required because it does not keep for more than 24 hours.     - 136 - Procedure  A. Pre-treatment 
Manual grinding (mortar) might be preferable to avoid potential contamination of samples with previous residues in the mechanical soil grinder.

Glassware might be a source of Si. Thus a blank sample should be analyzed for Si, and if significant, the concentration subtracted from the soil sample results. Also, if available, plastic flasks instead of glass should be used throughout.       - 137 - 6. Plant Sampling and Processing 
The effects of time of sampling, variety or hybrid and environmental factors, such as soil moisture, temperature, and light quality and intensity can significantly affect the relationship between nutrient concentration and plant response. Therefore, it is important that they be aware of the necessity of proper sampling. Otherwise, analyses that they are asked to perform on plant samples may end up to be meaningless and a waste of time. The analytical procedures described here are derived from well established reference materials in the literature, e.g., Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Westerman, 1990; 
Reuter and Robinson, 1986: Sparks et al., 1996). 6.1. Field Processing  Preparation for Sampling  
Preparation of a field trip for plant sampling has to be planned in advance. Always contact the people who will accompany you to the field for the necessary preparations, as follows:  Plant samples must be put in labeled, perforated plastic bags or paper bags.  Tags and markers are required.  The bags should be examined for cleanliness as well as for strength.  Plant samples can be transported to the laboratory in cardboard boxes.  All information about samples is recorded; each sample is given a laboratory number.  Clean tray or a clean cloth for collecting the plant and sub-sampling.  Sketch your field. Diagram it the way you sampled it. Be sure the sampled areas are labeled the same as sample containers. (This is so you have a record of which recommendations apply to which areas – do not rely on your memory).  Fill out the information sheets, writing clearly with a copying pen. The more information you can provide with each sample, the better your recommendation will be. Where to Take Sample?  
All plant samples taken from abnormal areas should be taken from just inside of the abnormal area. 
A separate plant analysis history must be completed for each sample taken as follow: Uniform Fields  
Where plant growth is uniform over the entire area, one composite sample is taken from at least 10 widely scattered areas in the field. One plant sample is necessary. One soil sample is recommended.  Non-uniform Fields  
In areas where crop growth or appearance of one area differs from the rest of the field, plant analysis can often determine the cause of these differences and indicate the best method to correct the problem. 
Sample when abnormalities are discovered. Two plant and two soil samples are required. This includes collecting soil and plant samples from the normal area.       - 138 - 
Sampling Time  The recommended time to sample usually occurs just prior to the beginning of the reproductive stage for many plants. However, sampling earlier or even later than the specified time may be recommended for specific plants or circumstances.   Sample plants that are showing a suspected nutrient deficiency symptom at the time or shortly after the visual symptoms appear. Amount of Plant Material  
All plant analyses require at least a rounded double handful of plant tissue. 
What to Sample  Leaves are most commonly chosen: recently matured ones are taken but new and old growth is generally avoided. However, young emerging leaves are sampled for diagnosing iron (Fe) chlorosis by determining ferrous (Fe) content of fresh leaves (Katyal and Sharma, 1980) and B content in certain crops (Bell, 1997). Damaged or diseased leaves are excluded, and plants should not be sampled when the crop is under moisture or temperature stress.   Petioles are selected for certain crops, e.g., cotton, sugar beet.   Seeds are rarely used for analysis, except for assessing of B toxicity, Zn and P deficiency in certain grain crops. In some cases, e.g., cereals, the entire above-ground young plants are sampled.   Avoid any type of contamination at all stages. Plant samples should never be kept in the store along with fertilizer materials and detergents. Contamination is likely when the plant samples are spread out to dry near stored fertilizers or on floor where fertilizers were stored previously.  Sampling procedures for important dryland crops of the WANA region are given in Appendix 10. 
What Not to Sample   Do not include diseased or dead plant material in a sample.   Do not sample or include plants or leaf tissue that have been damaged by insects or mechanically injured in a sample. When whole plants are sampled, remove the roots and wash the upper portion to remove soil particles.   Do not sample plants that have been stressed extensively by cold, heat, moisture deficiency, or by excess moisture. Examine both the below-ground as well as the above ground-ground portion of the plant. The presence of nematodes or roots damaged by other insects or diseases should preclude the need to sample.  
Shipment of the Plant Material Sample   Avoid decomposition during transport to the laboratory, which makes them useless for analysis purposes. Therefore, samples should be taken to the laboratory as quickly as possible.  A history form goes in the small envelope, which is then placed inside the large envelope containing the dried sample.     - 139 - 6.2. Laboratory Processing  
Sample preparation is critical in obtaining accurate analytical data and reliable interpretation of plant analysis results. Proven procedures must be followed during handling in the laboratory, decontamination, drying, grinding and mixing, and storage. Such preparatory procedures enhance the accuracy and reliability of the analytical results. 
Handling in the laboratory  As soon as the plant samples are received at the plant preparation laboratory, they should be checked with the accompanying information list. Information regarding samples should be entered in a register and each sample be given a laboratory number.  Keep plant samples refrigerated until cleaning. Take care that fermentation does not occur. Decontamination  
Decontamination procedures involving washing and rinsing should only be used for fresh, fully-turgid plant samples. After decontamination, samples should be dried immediately to stabilize the tissue and stop enzymatic reactions.  
A. Reagents and Apparatus  Deionized water  0.1 to 0.3 % detergent solution (non-phosphate)  Medium-stiff nylon bristle brush  Plastic containers suitable for washing and rinsing tissue samples 
B. Cleaning processing  A preliminary dry-wiping can be done if the plant sample is very dirty.  If the plant samples are too dirty and a dry-wiping is not possible, washing through the nylon bag can be done.   The samples must be properly cleaned, but no part of it should be under water for more than a few seconds.  Cleaning plant tissue to remove dust, pesticide and fertilizer residues, normally by washing the plants with DI water or with 0.1 – 0.3 % P-free detergent (like HCl 1%), followed by DI water.   Rinse each portion of the plant sample into a bath of DI water, into which it is plunged, agitated, and immediately withdrawn. Change the water and repeat the rinsing. Dry by shaking vigorously by hand.  Plant samples for soluble element determination may not be washed, particularly for long periods. However, plant samples for total Fe analysis must be washed.  Excessive washing is worse than no decontamination since soluble elements, including B, K, and N, are likely to leach from the tissue.  The wash and rinse periods should be as short as possible to avoid danger of N, B, K, and Cl leaching from the tissue.      - 140 - Drying 
Water is removed from plant tissue to stop enzymatic reactions and to stabilize the sample. Enzymes present in plant tissue become inactive at temperatures above 70 oC. As a result, air-drying may not stabilize samples and prevent enzymatic decomposition. Samples should, therefore, be properly dried as soon as possible after taking the sample. Some technical guidelines are as follows:  The plant sample material should be evenly and thinly spread in a container.  Place containers in well-ventilated drying oven.   If samples absorb significant amounts of moisture during grinding, additional drying may be required prior to weighing for analysis.   Drying time required will vary. Dry to constant weight.  The original condition and sample size will affect drying time.  The drying temperature should not exceed 70 oC, because higher temperatures may cause volatilization loss.  Drying at temperatures less than 70 oC may not remove all combined water and may result in poor homogenization and incorrect analytical results.  Drying temperatures above 70 oC may result in thermal decomposition and reduce dry weight.  A drying time of 24 hours may be sufficient in normal conditions.  Drying times longer than 24 hours may be required depending on the type and number of plant samples in the dryer.  Quick drying of a limited number of samples can be done using a microwave oven and the drying process is closely monitored. Grinding and Mixing  
Plant tissue samples are reduced to 0.5 to 1.0 mm particle size to ensure homogeneity and to facilitate organic matter destruction. 
A. Apparatus  Standard mills equipped with 20, 40, and 60-mesh screens and stainless steel contact points.  Tecator Cyclotec sample mill (standard equipped with a 1-mm sieve) or equivalent high speed grinder.  Medium bristle brush.  Vacuum system. 
B. Procedure  After drying, samples should be ground to pass a 1.0-mm screen (20 mesh) using the appropriate Wiley mill. A 20-mesh sieve is adequate if the sample aliquot to be assayed is >0.5 g. However, if the sample aliquot to be assayed is less than 0.5 g, a 40-mesh screen should be utilized.  After grinding, the sample should be thoroughly mixed and a 5 to 8 g aliquot withdrawn for analyses and storage. 
Notes  Using a brush or vacuum system, clean the grinding apparatus after each sample.  Uniform grinding and mixing are critical in obtaining accurate analytical results.     - 141 -  Exercise care when grinding very small samples or plant material that is pubescent, deliquescent, or that has a fibrous texture. These samples are difficult to grind in Wiley mills and the operator should allow sufficient time for the sample to pass through the screen to ensure homogeneity. In these instances, Cyclotec or equivalent high-speed grinders are preferable.  Most mechanical mills contribute some contamination of the sample with one or more elements. The extent of contamination depends on condition of the mill and exposure time   Use stainless steel for cutting and sieving surfaces to minimize contamination.  Routine maintenance should be made on mills to ensure optimum operating conditions.  Cutting knives or blades should be maintained in sharp condition and in adjustment.  Avoid cross-contamination from one sample to the next by cleaning the sample mill thoroughly with a dry brush or by using dry air under pressure.  If the plant sample is big enough, the mill can be rinsed with the material to be grinded.   When sampling mixed stands particularly forages and pastures, separate plant species. 
Similarly, the sample should be of only leaves or petioles or whole tops and not mixtures. Storage 
After grinding and mixing (homogenization), samples should be stored in conditions that minimize deterioration and maintain sample integrity for weighing and follow-up analytical work.  Apparatus  Airtight plastic storage containers  Storage cabinet located in cool, dark, and moisture-free environment  Refrigerator    Procedure  After grinding and homogenization, a representative sub-sample is taken from the ground plant material for analyses and storage, which should be placed in a container that can be securely sealed.  Containers should then be placed in a cool, dry place for storage.  For long-term storage, ground samples should be thoroughly dried, sealed, and placed under refrigerated conditions (4 oC) until the required analysis can be completed.  The dried and milled samples should be stored in a cool and dry place in flasks with tight stoppers or in sealed polyethylene bags, protected against direct sunlight.  During storage, the plant material may attract moisture so that the drying procedure must be repeated just before weighing out a sample for analysis.  Dry the sample 1 hour on 70 oC before analysis. 
Technical Remarks 1. If samples are placed in a cool (4 oC), dark, dry environment, storage life is indefinite. 2. Small manila envelopes can also be used for sample storage, but care must be taken to prevent absorption of moisture. Collect the ground sample in the envelope and immediately place in a desiccator cabinet or desiccator to minimize moisture absorption.      - 142 - 7. Plant Analysis 
After soil testing, plant analysis is critical to improving crop nutrition and yield. From the nutritional standpoint, plant analysis is based on the principle that the concentration of a nutrient within the plant is an integral value of all the factors that have interacted to affect it. The principles and procedures used for plant analyses have evolved over many years and changed as knowledge increased about each element that is essential for a plant to complete its life cycle. As such, the use of plant analyses has become an integral part of most agronomic research and a tool for crop consultants and fertilizer dealers to monitor production fields.  
The concentration of nutrients in plant tissues can be measured in a plant extract obtained from fresh plant material, (i.e., tissue analysis), as well as in whole dried plant material. The former test is qualitative and is appropriate only for quick measurements on a growing crop. Total plant analysis is quantitative in nature and is more reliable and useful. Generalized ranges of deficiency, adequacy, and excess of nutrient- concentrations in cereal crops are given in the Appendix 11. Of prime concern are forms of N, as well as P, B, and micronutrient cations. More detailed interpretative guidelines for plant analysis data are available in Reuter and Robinson (1986, 1997), Munson and Nelson (1990) and Jones et al. (1991).  
Effective Uses for Plant Analyses 
Plant analysis is an effective management strategy for a sustainable soil fertility program because it provides a direct measure of nutrient concentrations and balance within the plant. Therefore, the effective uses for plant analysis are as follow:  Confirm a diagnosis made from visible symptoms  Identify “hidden hunger” where no symptoms are apparent  Locate soil areas where deficiencies of one or more nutrients occur  Determine whether applied nutrients have entered the plant  Indicate among various nutrients  Study the internal functioning of nutrients in plants  Suggest additional tests or studies in identifying a crop production problem.      - 143 - 7.1. Moisture Factor 
Weighing of oven-dried samples is, however, cumbersome (involves continuous oven-drying and use of desiccators, and is still prone to error), as plant material may absorb moisture during the weighing process, particularly if the relative humidity is high in the laboratory. To get around this difficulty, use moisture factor instead. The moisture factor for each batch of samples can be calculated as follows: by oven-drying only a few sub-samples from the lot (say about 5 from a batch of 100 – 200 samples).                                                                                 
Thereafter, air-dry samples are weighed, considering the moisture factor.  7.2. Nitrogen 
Plants need a wide range of proteins to grow, develop and mature. The main body of protein is amino acids and nitrogen (N) is the major component of amino acids. Nitrogen is also present in chlorophyll. Soil micro-organisms feed on soil N during breakdown of organic materials. Nitrogen improves quality of leafy vegetables. It promotes rapid growth and if the supply is out of balance with other nutrients flowering and fruiting may be delayed.  
The N content of plant dry matter generally ranges from 1 to 5 %. However occasionally it may be either lower or higher than this range. The common plant analysis is that of N by Kjeldahl method. 
However, wet ashing with H2SO4 and H2O2 is also used for eliminating the standard use of selenium (Se) in the former method. 7.2.1. Kjeldahl Nitrogen (with Catalyst) Apparatus Block-digester Distillation unit

This solution contains 1.2 g NH4-N/L (Stock Solution). Procedure  
A. Pre-treatment  1. Mix and spread finely ground (Cyclone mill) plant sample in a thin layer on a sheet of paper until it looks uniform. 2. Select representative sub-samples of about 1 g by taking at least 10 small portions from all parts of the sample with a spatula, and put them into a plastic vial. 3. Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C in an oven (overnight), and then cool in a desiccator.  
B. Digestion  1. Weigh 0.25 g (grain) or 0.50 g (straw) of dry plant material, and transfer quantitatively into a 100-mL digestion tube. 2. Add a few pumice boiling granules, and add about 3 g catalyst mixtures using a calibrated spoon. 3. Add 10 mL concentrated H2SO4 using a dispenser, and stir with Vortex tube stirrer until mixed well. 4. Place tubes in a block-digester set at 100 °C for 20 minutes, and remove the tubes to wash down any material adhering to the neck of the tube with the same concentrated H2SO4.  5. Thoroughly agitate the tube contents, and then place the tubes back on the block-digester set at 380 °C for 2 hours after clearing. 6. After digestion is complete, remove tubes, cool, and bring to 100-mL volume with DI water. 7. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (no plant), and one chemical standard (weigh 0.1 g EDTA standard digest), and one standard plant sample (internal reference).       - 145 - 
C. Distillation  1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not; titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                               3 Carry out distillations as follows:  Dispense 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Pipette 10-mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask.  Carefully add 10 mL 10 N NaOH solution, and immediately connect the flask to the distillation unit and begin distillation.  Collect about 35 mL distillate in the collecting dish.  Remove distillation flask and connect an empty 100-mL distillation flask to the distillation unit. Drain water from the condenser jacket and steam out apparatus for 90 seconds before connecting the next sample.  Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto-Titrator; record titration volume of acid.  Each distillation should contain at least two standards (pipette 10 mL digested solution), two blanks (pipette 10 mL digested solution). Recovery of N should be at least 96 %.  
Notes:  After finishing titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish. Between different samples, steam out the distillations. 
Disconnect distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds. Each distillation should contain at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks).        - 146 -

V = Volume of 0.01 N H2SO4 titrated for the sample (mL) 
V1 = Volume of NH4-N standard solution (mL) 
V2   = Tolat volume of the plant digest (mL) 
V3  = Volume of plant digest used for distillation (mL) 
B   = Distillate blank titration volume (mL) 
B1   = Digested blank titration volume (mL) Wt1   = Weight of EDTA (g) 
Wt2   = Weight of dry plant (g) 
N = Normality of H2SO4 solution   C = Concentration of NH4-N standard solution (μg/mL) 14.01 = Atomic weight of N 186.1 = Atomic weight of EDTA 
Technical Remarks 1. Samples should contain about 1 mg of N (but no more than 5 mg). The sensitivity of the procedure depends upon a number of factors, including sample weight, strength of the acid, and accuracy of titration. 2. If the ratio of acid to salt is low at the end of the digestion step, a significant amount of NH3 may be volatilized during the digestion process. Other situations which may cause N loss during digestion and should be avoided are: localized heating in the digestion flask (temperatures above 410°C), and the use of 30% hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) as an oxidant.  3. The time required for digestion is affected by the catalyst, temperature, and type of plant tissue. It is important to allow an equal length of additional time after the sample clears. As much as 10% of the organic N may not yet be converted to NH4  at clearing. 4. Homogeneity of the sample is important for precision. For best results, dried tissue should pass a 40-mesh sieve. In cases where sample size is less than 0.25 g, special care should be taken to insure sample homogeneity. 5. Digested samples may be stored for several days, provided samples are covered and placed in a cool area. 6. Samples distilled into the H3BO3 solution should be titrated within a short time to avoid absorption of atmospheric CO2.     - 147 - 7.2.2. Kjeldahl Nitrogen (Without Catalyst) 
The routine use of heavy metals as catalysts can be harmful environmentally. Therefore, treatment of plant material with a mixture of H2O2-H2SO4 in the absence of metal catalysts is proposed as an alternative digestion procedure for replacing the standard Kjeldahl-N determination in soils and plants. Reagents 
Sulfuric Acid (H2SO4), concentrated 
Hydrogen Peroxide (H2O2), 30%  
Procedure 1. Weigh 0.5 g dry-plant material into a 100-mL digestion tube. 2. Add 3-4 pumice boiling granules, and then add 5 mL concentrated H2SO4, mix well. 3. Keep overnight. 4. Heat on a block-digester at a moderate temperature 100 – 150 °C. 5. Swirl to restrict foaming. If foaming enters the neck of the digestion tube, add 2 mL 30 % 
H2O2. 6. Heat the tubes for 30 – 60 minutes on the block-digester. 7. Cool the tubes, and then add 2 mL 30 % H2O2. 8. Raise the temperature of the block-digester to 280 °C. 9. Heat the tubes for 10 minutes at 280 °C. 10. Cool, then add 2 mL 30 % H2O2, and heat for 10 minutes. 11. Repeat Steps 9 and 10 until solution remains clear after 10 minutes of heating. 12. Cool, and make up to 100-mL volume with DI water. 
Measurement 1. Nitrogen content can be measured in this digest by the Distillation Method (Kjeldahl unit).  2. Phosphorus can be done colorimetrically as be used for P measurement in plants, after filtering the digest through Whatman No. 1 or No. 5 filter paper.  
Note  The results for both N and P are highly correlated with the standard Kjeldahl digestion method.     - 148 - 7.2.3. Total Nitrogen (Sulfuric-Salicylic Acid Mixture) 
This method is based on digestion of plant material in a sulfuric-salicylic acid mixture (Buresh et al., 1982). Reagents 
A. Sulfuric-Salicylic Acid Mixture (concentrated H2SO4 containing 2.5 % w/v salicylic acid)  
Dissolve 62.5g reagent-grade salicylic acid (C7H6O3) in 2.5 L concentrated H2SO4. 
B. Catalyst Mixture (K2SO4 - Se), 100:1 w/w ratio 
Grind reagent-grade chemicals separately and mix. If caked, grind the mixture in a porcelain pestle and mortar to pass a 60-mesh screen (0.250 mm), taking care not to breath Se dust or allow Se to come in contact with skin. 
C. Sodium Thiosulfate (Na2S2O3.5H2O), crystal 
D. Ethylene Diaminetetraacetic Acid Disodium Salt (EDTA), M.W. = 372.2 Procedure 
A. Pre-treatment 1. Mix and spread finely ground plant sample in a thin layer, on a sheet of paper or plastic until the sample looks uniform. 2. Take a representative sub-sample of about 1 g by systematically withdrawing at least 10 small portions from all parts of the sample with a spatula, and put them into a plastic vial. 3. Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C in an oven (overnight), and then cool in a desiccator.  
B. Digestion 4. Weigh 0.25 g (grain) or 0.50 g (straw) dry-plant material, and then transfer quantitatively into a dry 250-mL digestion tube. 5. Add 20 mL sulfuric-salicylic acid mixture while rotating the tube to wash down any sample adhering to the neck of the tube, and allow to stand 2 hours or longer with occasional swirling. 6. Add 2.5 g sodium thiosulfate through a long-stemmed funnel to the contents of the tube and swirl gently a few times, and allow to stand overnight. 7. Add 4 g catalyst mixture, and 3 – 4 pumice boiling granules, and place tubes on the block digester pre-heated to 400 °C. 8. Place a small glass funnel in the mouth of the tubes to ensure efficient refluxing of the digestion mixture and prevent loss of H2SO4, and proceed with the digestion until the mixture clears. 9. Remove the tubes from the block-digester and allow them to cool for about 20 minutes. 
Then wash down any material adhering to the neck of the tube with a minimum quantity of 
DI water. 10. Thoroughly agitate the tube contents, place tubes back on the block-digester, and digest for 2 hours after clearing. No particulate material should remain in the tube after digestion. 11. After the digestion is finished, allow the digest to cool, and add water slowly shaking until the liquid level is about 2-cm below the graduation mark. 12. Allow tube to cool to room temperature, and add DI water to bring the volume to the 250 mL mark. 13. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (no plant), and one chemical standard (weigh 0.1 g EDTA standard digest), and one standard plant sample (internal reference).      - 149 - 
C. Distillation 1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not, titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                              3. Carry out distillations as follows:  Dispense 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placed underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Prior to distillation, shake the digestion tube to thoroughly mix its contents, and pipette an aliquot in a 300-mL distillation flask.  Carefully add 7 mL 10 N NaOH solution for 25-mL aliquot (or 15 mL 10 N NaOH solution for 50-mL aliquot), and immediately connect flask to distillation unit and begin distillation.  Collect about 35-mL distillate in the collecting dish.  Remove distillation flask and connect an empty 100-mL distillation flask to the distillation unit. Drain water from the condenser jacket and steam out apparatus for 90 seconds before connecting the next sample.  The distillate is then titrated to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto
Titrator; record titration volume of acid.  Each distillation should contain at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks). 
Recovery of EDTA, corrected for reagent blank, should be at least 97%.  
Notes: After finishing titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish. Between different samples, steam out the distillations. 
Disconnect distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds.      - 150 -

Phosphorous (P) is essential to crop production; it stimulates early root formation and growth, gives a rapid and vigorous start to plants, and promotes flower and seed production. Phosphorous is needed in the genetic coding material which controls cell division. The P content in plants is usually between 0.1 to 0.5 % of the dry matter. Total P in plant material can be attained either by wet-digestion procedure or by dry-ashing procedure (given in Section 7.4.1). Both methods are satisfactory. 
However, dry-ashing is a simpler, easier, non-hazardous and economical option. Later, P content in the digests or dissolved ash aliquots is measured colorimetrically.  Apparatus

Plant analysis by dry ashing is simple, non-hazardous and less expensive, compared with HNO3-HClO4 wet digestion. Dry ashing is appropriate for analyzing P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na. Micronutrient cations (Fe, 
Zn, Cu, and Mn) can also be analyzed by dry-ashing, but only in plant tissues containing low silica contents (like legumes). The procedure is that of Chapman and Pratt (1961) with slight modifications. 
The HNO3-HClO4 wet digestion (given in Section 7.4.3) is required for full recovery of micronutrient cations in high-silica plant tissues (e.g., wheat, barley, rice, and sugarcane, etc.).  7.4.1. Macronutrients (Dry Ashing) 
Dry ashing is carried out usually at an ignition temperature of 550 0C to 600 0C followed by its extraction in diluted HCl or H2SO4 for determining various elements. Ashing leads to considerable volatile loss of P, K, S and Cl. For this reason, and being more time-taking, dry-ashing is only occasionally adopted.      Critical factors in dry-ashing procedures include selection of ashing vessel, sample number, placement in furnace, ashing temperature, time, selection of acid to solubilise the ash, and final volume.  Placement of vessels and ashing time are dependent on the type and number of samples. 
Selection of an ashing vessel, the solubilising acid, and final volume are dependent on the elements of interest and subsequent analytical procedures. A number of combinations of these factors have been used successfully. 
Phosphorus, K, Ca, and Mg can be determined in a range of plant tissue concentrations from 0.1 to 0.7 % P, 0.5 to 5 % K, 0.2 to 2 % Ca, and 0.1 to 1 % Mg. Manganese and Fe can be determined in the range from 25 to 500 ppm. Copper and Zn can be determined in the range from 5 to 50 ppm. The ranges may be extended by dilution, or calibrating the instrument for higher concentrations.  Apparatus

Procedure 1. Weigh 0.5 – 1.0 g dry and ground plant material in a 30 – 50 mL porcelain crucibles or Pyrex glass beakers. 2. Place porcelain crucibles into a cool muffle furnace, and increase temperature gradually to 550 °C. 3. Continue ashing for 5 hours after attaining 550 °C. 4. Shut off the muffle furnace and open the door cautiously for rapid cooling. 5. When cool, take out the porcelain crucibles carefully. 6. Dissolve the cooled ash in 5-mL portions 2 N HCl and mix with a plastic rod. 7. After 15 – 20 minutes, bring to the volume (usually to 50-mL) using DI water. 8. Mix thoroughly, allow standing for about 30 minutes, and use the supernatant or filter through Whatman No. 42 filter paper, discarding the first portions of the filtrates. 9. Analyze the aliquots for P by Colorimetry (by Ammonium Vanadate-Ammonium Molybdate yellow color method), for K and Na by Flame Photometry, for Ca, Mg by titration with EDTA, and for Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn by Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy.                                                                         
Where:     V= Total volume of the extract (mL) Wt= Weight of dry plant (g) 
Technical Remarks 1. For Ca and Mg measurement, the final dilution should contain 1% w/v lanthanum (La) and the determinations should be against standards and blank containing a similar La concentration to overcome anionic interference. 2. If a clean white ash remains after muffling, oxidation is complete and ashing aids are not required. 3. Plant materials with high sugar or oil content (highly carbonaceous) may require an ashing aid such as 10 % H2SO4, concentrated HNO3, and 7% Mg (NO3)2.6H2O.  4. Dry-ashing is not recommended for plant materials that are high in Si. Dry-ashing these materials results in low micronutrient values, especially for Zn. 5. Dry ashing results in lower Fe and Al values than wet-ashing.  6. The sensitivity varies depending on the instrument used and the wavelength selected for each element. 7. This method has very little interference, except due to spectral overlap which occurs when an element emits a wavelength that is very close to the wavelength of an element being analyzed and the optical system of the instrument is incapable of resolving the two wavelengths. 8. Samples to be analyzed after storage should be placed in an oven at 30 oC for 4 hours before weighing. 9. The crucible used for ashing should be rinsed first in DI water and later in several portions of 25 % HCl and then rinsed several times with DI water and dried in an oven.  10. When organic solution is required for determination of some of the micronutrients such as 
Cu, special attention must be paid to the cleaning of glassware or separator funnels by shaking with the reagent and organic solution.  11. There are no reported interferences for Mn, Cu, and Zn. 12. The presence of HNO3 and Ni, or Si may depress the sensitivity of Fe. Using a very hot, lean burning, air/acetylene flame appears to overcome these interferences.    - 154 - 7.4.2. Boron (Dry Ashing) 
The content of boron (B) in plant dry matter ranges between 10 and 100-200 ppm. Boron helps in the manufacture of sugars and carbohydrates in crops, which is essential for fruit development, and translocation of sugars, and development of seed and seed quality in some crops like mungbeans. 
Boron aids in the utilization of Ca, N and P, also B is important in the development of young roots and shoots. Boron in plant samples is measured by dry-ashing (Chapman and Pratt, 1961) and subsequent measurement of B by colorimetry using Azomethine-H (Bingham, 1982). Apparatus Porcelain crucibles

DI water, and then bring to volume. These solutions contain 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 ppm, respectively. Procedure 
A. Ashing 1. Weigh 1 g dry and ground plant material in porcelain crucible. 2. Ignite in a muffle furnace by slowly raising the temperature to 550 °C.  3. Continue ashing for 6 hours after attaining 550 °C.  4. Wet the ash with five drops DI water, and then add 10 mL 0.36 N H2SO4 solution into the porcelain crucibles.  5. Heat on a steam bath for 20 minutes.    - 155 - 6. Let stand at room temperature for 1 hour, stirring occasionally with a plastic rod to break up ash. 7. Filter through Whatman No.1 filter paper into a 50-mL polypropylene flask and bring to volume. Filtrate is ready for B determination. 
B. Measurement 1. Pipette 1-mL an aliquot of the extract into a 10-mL polypropylene tube. 2. Add 2 mL buffer solution. 3. Add 2 mL azomethine-H solution, and mix well. 4. Prepare a standard curve as follows:   Pipette 1 mL of each standard (0.5 – 3.0 ppm), proceed as for the samples.  Make a blank with 1 mL DI water, proceed as for the samples.  5. Read the absorbance of blank, standards, and samples after 30 minutes on the 
Spectrophotometer at 420-nm wavelength. 6. Prepare a calibration curve for standards, plotting absorbance against the respective B concentrations. 7. Read B concentration in the unknown samples from the calibration curve.

Where:     V= Total volume of the extract (mL) Wt= Weight of dry plant (g) 
Technical Remarks 1. Avoid the use of borosilicate glassware, and always use concentrated HCl-treated glassware (for a week), where absolutely essential. The main source of contamination during B determination may not always be the glassware, but rather, the impurities contained in the chemical reagents. Consequently, special care should care be taken to ensure that chemical reagents are purified before use. 2. Where possible interferences occur, NH4 can be overcome by the use of NH4OAc, K by use of 
KOAc; and Al, Cu, and Fe by use of EDTA. 3. The treatment of DI water with charcoal would remove organic substances that may interfere with the colour development. 4. The possible interference of residual H2O2 with color development is eliminated by a heating time of 40 minutes following the last H2O2 addition.  5. The use of photometric tubes for color development does eliminate the use of additional plastic or glassware; however, the importance of immediate and thorough mixing is stressed.    - 156 - 7.4.3. Micronutrient (Wet Digestion) 
Full recovery of micronutrient cations (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) in high-silica containing plant tissues (such as wheat, barley, rice, sugarcane, etc.) is not possible by the dry-ashing procedure. Therefore, this kind of plant material should be wet-digested using HNO3-HClO4. The digestion procedure is adapted from Rashid (1986). Many other elements (e.g., P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na) can also be determined in the same digest. Apparatus Block-digester Vortex tube stirrer

Place small and short-stemmed funnels in the mouth of the tubes to reflux acid. 4. After the preliminary digestion, place the tubes in a cold block-digester, and then raise temperature to 150 °C for 1 hour.  5. Place the U-shaped glass rods under each funnel to permit exit of volatile vapors. 6. Increase temperature slowly until all traces of HNO3 disappear, and then remove U shaped glass rods. 7. Raise temperature to 235 °C. When the dense white fumes of HClO4 appear in the tubes, continue digestion for 30 minutes more. 8. Lifts the tubes rack out of the block-digester, cool a few minutes, and add a few drops DI water carefully through the funnel.  9. After vapors condense, add DI water in small increments for washing down walls of tubes and funnels. 10. Bring to volume, mix the solution of each tube, and then leave undisturbed for a few hour. 11. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (no plant material).

Technical Remarks 1. Heated mixtures of HClO4 and organic matter (OM) may explode violently. Avoid this hazard by taking the following precaution: (a) do not add HClO4 to a hot solution containing organic matter; (b) always pre-treat samples containing organic matter with HNO3 before adding HClO4.  2. Filtrate may be capped and refrigerated overnight.  3. Samples should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before analyses.  7.5. Heavy Metals 
For the release of mineral elements from plant tissues, dry-ashing and wet oxidation are the two widely adopted methods. Critical factors in wet digestion procedures include selection of the digestion vessel, temperature and its control, time, the digestion mixture, and final volume. Selection of a digestion vessel is dependent on the elements of interest and the heat source. Time and temperature are interrelated and are dependent on the digestion mixture. Wet oxidation employs oxidizing acids such as HNO3-H2SO4-HClO4 (tri-acid mixture) or HNO3-HClO4 (di-acid). Use of HClO4 avoids volatilization losses of P, K and S and provides a clear solution, while H2SO4 helps completing oxidation. The wet oxidation method being easier, less time-consuming and convenien, is given below. 7.5.1. Tri-Acid (HNO3-H2SO4-HClO4), Block Digester Apparatus Digestion tube Block-digester

Procedure 1. Weigh 0.5-1.0 g dry and ground plant material (0.15 mm) into a 300-mL calibrated digestion tube (or into a 150-ml conical flask). 2. Add 5 mL concentrated H2SO4 (in the fume hood), and swirl carefully and then place tubes in the rack.  3. Place the tubes rack in the block-digester (or hot plate), and then place a glass funnel in the neck of the tubes. Slowly increase temperature setting to about 145 °C for 1 hour. 4. Add 5 mL tri-acid mixtures and heat it to 240 o C for to further 1 hour, and if possible, keep overnight to prevent excessive foaming. 5. Lift the tubes rack out of the block-digester, carefully place on a rack holder, and let tubes cool to room temperature. 6. Filter through Whatman No. 42 filter paper and bring to 50-mL volume. 7. Determine Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, Pb, Co, and Cr by Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer. 8. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (no plant). 
Notes  The first stage of destruction should take at least 40 minutes, preferably more, so the HNO3 can destroy all the easily oxidizable materials. If this is not done explosions might take place.  As a second precaution, H2SO4 is present to dilute the HClO4 in the final stage.  Wash fume hood and chimney regularly. Condensed HClO4 might start a fire. The ventilator should be of the centrifugal type.  Sodium-nitrite reduces insoluble higher Mn oxides that might have formed.  7.5.2.

Technical Remarks 1. Calcium and Mg can be determined in the di-acid digest of plant samples either using AAS or 
Versenate titration. When using AAS, lanthanum (La) must be added in the sample. Addition of 0.1-1.0% La prevent the interference of Al, Be, P, Si, Ti, V and Zn. 2. The Microwave oven should be checked routinely for leakage using an electromagnetic monitor. 3. The digestion vessel carousel should be rotated during digestion period. This ensures that all samples are subjected to the same microwave flux. 4. After HNO3 digestion, samples must be cooled before adding H2O2. Otherwise, there is excessive frothing due to the reaction between H2O2 and hot acid digest. 5. Immediately before use, all glass, plastic ware and Teflon digestion vessels should be thoroughly rinsed first with dilute HCl (1:3/acid:DI water ratio) and then with double-DI water. 6. Screw caps are used to provide reflux action. 7. Reagents should be added to the samples in the fume hood. 8. Nitric acid is used in most wet-oxidation procedures. The addition of H2SO4 is to raise digestion temperature, while HClO4 or 30% H2O2 are used to increase the speed of reaction and ensure complete digestion. 9. Most wet-digestion procedures can be completed using covered beakers on hot plates but digestion blocks are preferred due to enhanced temperature control. 10. Wet-ashing is recommended for plant materials that are high in Si.  11. Wet-ashing results in higher Fe and Al values than dry-ashing.  7.6. Silicon  
Silicon (Si), in the form of silicon dioxide (SiO2), is extracted out of plant samples (and converted into silicic acid, H3SiO4) during oxidation of organic material, i.e., by elimination of carbon (C) by digestion with hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) under alkaline conditions. The H3SiO4 can be determined colorimetrically by reaction with molybdate; blue and yellow (this procedure) analyses methods are usually distinguished. The method presented follows the description provided by Korndörfer et al. (2004), who, in turn, expanded on the method of Elliot et al., (1991).

F. Standard Stock Solution (SiCl4 in 14 % NaOH), 50 ppm  With Merck Titrisol® Silicon standard 1000 mg solution (SiCl4 in 14% NaOH; Merck-I.N.: 109947): Open the capsule and let the Si-solution flow into a 1-L volume (to make sure that the 1000 mg of Si in the capsule is transferred completely to the flask, rinse the capsule thoroughly with DI water). Fill up with DI water (Stock Solution). The Silicon standard 1000 mg solution is not a 1000 ppm solution!  Add 25 mL stock solution to a 500-mL volumetric flask and then bring to volume with DI water. This solution contains 50 ppm Si (Diluted Stock Solution).This solution cannot be stored, and needs to be prepared fresh! Procedure  
A. Pre-treatment 1. Mix and spread finely ground plant sample in a thin layer, on a sheet of paper or plastic until the sample looks uniform. 2. Take a representative sub-sample of about 1 g by systematically withdrawing at least 10  small portions from all parts of the sample with a spatula, and put them into a plastic vial. 3. Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C in an oven (overnight), and then cool in a desiccator. 
B. Extraction 1. Weigh 0.1 g dry and ground plant material into 100-mL polypropylene tubes (e.g., round centrifuge tubes).     - 162 - 2. Add 2 mL 500 g/L H2O2 solution (under fume hood, using plastic gloves). Agitate for a few seconds with the magnetic stirrer. 3. Add 3 mL 500 g/L NaOH solution and agitate again. Note 
Depending on the type of plant samples, the oxidation process could be quite intensive and the solution in the tube might spill/foam over. Thus, it is recommended to watch the reaction closely. 
The digestion can be controlled by agitation with magnetic stirrer. 4. Put the tubes in 85 °C water bath for 1 hour (avoid potential spilling). 5. Once the sample has stopped releasing gas, put the stoppers on the tubes and put them into an autoclave for 1 hour at 123 °C and 1.5 bar (= 150 kPa). 6. In case the plant material does not appear to be completely digested, add another 1 mL 500 g/L H2O2 solution, and put the sample(s) into the autoclave for another 1 hour. 7. Add 45 mL DI water. 8. Transfer the extracts into plastic cups (labeled). Leave the samples until the residues have settled at the bottom of the cup. 
C. Measurement 1. Pipette a 1-mL aliquot of the supernatant extract-solution into a 50-mL plastic cup.  2. Add 19 mL DI water (2 mL of supernatant may be used for samples with low Si-content. Then only 18 mL DI water is added). 3. Prepare a series of standard solution from the Diluted stock solution 50 ppm as follows: 
Dilute 0, 2, 4, 6 and 8 mL into a 50-mL flask, and bring to volume with DI water.  4. Pipette 20-mL an aliquot of each standard into a 50-mL plastic cup.  5. Add to samples and standards 1 mL 500 g/L HCl solution and 2 mL ammonium heptamolybdate solution. Shake carefully. Depending on the concentration of Si, a more or less intensive yellow color develops.  6. After 5-10 minutes, add 2 mL oxalic acid solution. Shake again carefully. Note 
The amount of added HCl should be proportional to the withdrawn amount of supernatant extract solution, because complexation of Si and development of a yellow color does not occur under alkaline conditions.  7. Read the absorbance of blank, standards, and samples on the Spectrophotometer at 410 nm wavelength. 8. Prepare a calibration curve for standards, plotting absorbance against the respective Si concentration. 9. Read Si concentration in the unknown samples from the calibration curve. Note 
The yellow color is not very stable and will start disappearing already after only 15 minutes.    - 163 -

For quality control, a standard sample (such as wheat or rice chaff) might be analyzed every 20th sample, and analyses repeated if deviation from originally measured Si-content is >5 %.      - 164 - 8. Water Sampling and Processing 
Water sampling and analysis is a vital part in agricultural and environmental applications for studying the quality of water treatment process, distribution system, or source of water supply. 
Therefore, water sampling program starts with collections of samples which accurately represent the characteristics of the bulk material and handled conveniently in the laboratory while still providing test results. The major source of error in the whole process of obtaining water quality information often occurs during sampling. Over 50 % of the faulty data that occur in laboratory test results are due to sampling error, rather than during laboratory analysis. Much of what is presented here is based on standard methods for the examination of waters and wastewaters (APHA, 1998). 8.1. Preparation for Sampling  Suitability of the containers  
The correct sample container type and volume should be used for the required analysis in consultation with the laboratory requirements such as:  Containers should be examined for cleanliness, ensuring it is strong and durable, so that it will not break in transit and that the cap does not leak once it is secured.   Containers must not contain any of the compounds that samples are to be analyzed for.  Containers must be suitable for sampling the water.  Container must be of the appropriate size.   Containers must be high density polyethylene or glass containers with Teflon® lid liners for most analyses.   Rubber and cork stoppers must not be used so as to avoid the risk of contaminating the sample. 
Decontamination of the container 
Decontamination procedures involve washing and rinsing. The decontamination of the containers is of utmost importance, for most parameters:  Rinse the sampling device and the bottle thoroughly with DI water or with the sample (discarding the rinse into the effluent).  When some solid matter is adhered, use a brush with cleanser or something suitable to give it a pre-wash before taking the above action (Soaps are not suitable as they are liable to remain inside the container).  The suitability of the cleaning procedure should be checked at regular intervals by filling a cleaned container with distilled or ion exchange water and then analyzing the water for the target analyses. If none are detected, then the cleaning procedure is shown to be suitable.  For certain target analyses there are preferred cleaning procedures. For example, for nitrate analysis the container should not be rinsed with nitric acid and for chloride analysis should not be rinsed with hydrochloric acid.   For most purposes, containers can be reused if they are cleaned with a non-phosphate detergent, rinsed with hot tap water, rinsed with dilute acid, and then re-rinsed with tap water, followed by distilled or ion exchange water and air drying.      - 165 - 
Sampling techniques and equipment 
Sampling techniques depend on the available equipment, the sampling site and the analyses to be performed. Some possible variables to be considered and decisions to be made include:  Manual or automatic sampling equipment.  Location of the sampling site, whether indoors, outdoors, or difficulties involved.  Temporary or permanent sampler installation.  Power availability, compressed air.  Field equipment such as: - Multiple samplers or automatic composite samplers. - Chilled cool-boxes. - Meters.  - Filtration apparatus. - Adequate trouble-shooting equipment for small repairs. 
Recommended sampling procedure  
The recommended procedure for collecting water samples is as follows:  Water samples must be put in labeled suitable container or clear glass (label should be written in waterproof ink) depending on laboratory requirement. Ensure that the bottle is adequately labeled so it can be identified at all stages of the transport and analytical process.  The laboratory requirements for analysis are a minimum of 500-mL depending on required analyses (one liter would be suitable).  Rinse the bottle at least 4 times with the water to be sampled.  Do not dispose of the rinse water where it may contaminate or mix with that which is to be sampled.  Take 5 sub-samples (100-200 mL each) to make up the full sample.  Fill the bottle to the top, leaving little or no air space and seal tightly with the cap.  All information about water samples is recorded on the sample container and in the field log book, e.g., the number with the site code, time and date of collection, parameter to be tested, sampler’s name, and other details to avoid mix-ups. Each sample is given a laboratory number.  Sketch your field. Diagram it the way you sampled it. Be sure sampled areas are labeled the same as sample containers. (This is so you have a record of which recommendations apply to which areas – do not rely on your memory).  Information sheet should be clearly written with copying pencil. Fill out the information sheets. The more information you can provide with each sample, the better your recommendation will be.  Use plastic bottles for inorganic and metals, and glass bottles for organics.  Sterile containers for bacteriological analysis  Filtering for metals if a preservative is being used.  Every time you collect a sample, you should record it on the field data sheet.  Clearly mark and identify the separate sample containers from each location.   Certain observations and measurements before sending it to the laboratory. These observations should include appearance (color, haziness, turbidity, oil on the surface, and odor). Also, some measurements are valid only on a fresh sample (temperature, dissolved oxygen and pH).  Containers must be closed until ready to analysis.   All water samples should be stored in chilled cool-boxes prior to dispatch to laboratory.    - 166 - 8.2. Water Sampling Processing Representative sample  
A representative sample is taken from a large body of water to make up a sample (sub-samples of 500 mL) which represents the whole body of water. To minimize the effect of natural variation in the data collected, the sample should be collected:  - From exactly the same location - At approximately the same time each day - In the same way - Analyze them in the same way 
Water samples can be taken directly from the body of water (stream or dam), or if a pump is used, from the first outlet along the supply line. Below, some instructions for taking a representative of water samples:  Stream: Sample taken from main stream flow.  Stock drinking water: Sample taken from near the edge.   Dam: If water is pumped from a dam, and the sample is not taken from the outlet side of the pump, take the sample from near where suction side of the pump draws water. If wishing to assess changes in quality throughout the dam, where the water may settle into well-defined layers, it may be necessary to sample the chosen layers separately. The practicality of sampling from specific depths needs to be considered. The sample is taken from upper layers first.  Underground source: When water is drawn from an underground source, i.e. a bore or well, this is often the only way to sample. Allow the pump to run for sufficient time to flush out water which has been in the pipe, then take samples at time intervals of 5-10 minutes, from the first off take point, e.g., tap, trough, or sprinkler head.  Reticulated source: If the water is drawn from a reticulated source, e.g., irrigation scheme, city or town water supply, check with the local supplying authority, as they may have analytical data on the chemical and other characteristics of the water.  Water irrigation: Where the water is used for irrigation or piped for livestock or domestic purposes, the simplest approach is normally to let the pump do the sampling.  Type of water sampling 
The two types of samples most commonly obtained are grab samples and composite samples:  Grab samples are single samples collected at a specific spot at a site over a short period of time not exceeding 15 minutes. Thus, they represent only the composition of its source at the time and place of collection. A grab sample is required for test parameters which must be measured immediately after collection, and for tests which require the entire contents of a single sample container for analysis or for tests where the parameter will change over time. 
Examples of test parameters which require grab samples are temperature, pH, residual chlorine, and dissolved oxygen.  Composite samples are obtained by taking an appropriate number of grab samples collected at equal intervals or proportional to flow. Flow proportional composite samples are collected when the flow and waste characteristics are continually changing. This single sample reflects the average conditions of a point-source during an interval. The nature of the composite sample requires the tested parameters to be stable in the container for the duration of sampling, often 24 hours (this is usually means that the samples are refrigerated to 4 °C).    - 167 - 
Protecting and preserving samples  
The physical and chemical characteristics of a water sample can change during transport and storage. 
Therefore, protecting and preservation methods only slow chemical and biological changes that inevitably occur after collecting sample. Some parameters change more quickly than others, and so need to be analyzed on site.  
Protecting and preservation of samples is the main thing to obtain good quality result (see Appendix 
No. 18 for more details): 1. The most common preservative approach is cooling to 4 °C. This can be achieved by making slurry of ice and water and placing the collected sample in the slurry. This serves to slow biological activity in the sample and keep dissolved gases in solution. However, it can hasten certain physical processes such as precipitation of metals.  2. Other common preservatives (prevent known chemical reactions and maintain a target analyte in solution) include: - Use of sodium thiosulfate (final concentration is 0.008 %) to remove chlorine. - Use of copper sulfate or mercuric chloride to halt biological activity. - Use of zinc acetate to trap sulfides.  - Appropriate pH adjustment to either, over 12 SU (Standard Units) with sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or less than 2 SU with hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H2SO4) or nitric acid (HNO3) (depending on the intended analyze) can inactivate biological processes. 3. The analyst must be aware that acidification of nitrate-nitrite samples with HNO3 or preservation of SO4 samples with H2SO4 will invalidate the analyses, so the sampler must make adequate notation. 4. Samples which are not preserved must be analyzed immediately.  
Handling and storage of samples for analysis   As soon as the water samples are received at the water analysis laboratory, they should be checked with the accompanying information list (including sample number and date of sampling should be written on the container. Information regarding samples should be entered in a register and each sample be given a laboratory number.   The sample(s) should be kept refrigerated or on ice in a cooler (but not allowed to freeze) as soon as possible. Changes caused by growth of microorganisms are best slowed by cold and dark.   In general, the shorter the time between collection and analysis, the more reliable the results will be.  
Health and safety  Laboratory personnel who are routinely exposed to water samples, that may contain live microorganisms, are encouraged to protect themselves from water-borne illnesses by wearing clean disposable gloves and washing their hands frequently.   Care must be taken when handling hazardous reagents by using protective clothing and safety goggles.     - 168 - 9. Water Analysis 
Water is essential for all aspects of life, domestic use, industrial processes, and agricultural production. Its suitability for a particular purpose can be determined by analysis.  Obtaining good results depends to a great extent on the following factors: - Ensuring that the sample taken is truly representative of the water under consideration - Using proper sampling techniques - Protecting and preserving the samples until they are analyzed (in a timely manner) 
The water and wastewater should be checked for chemical, physical (turbidity and solid matter) and biological contamination before used it, to avoid environmental pollution (most of diseases can be spread to plant, animal, and human by water contaminated).   9.1. pH pH is a measure of how acidic or alkaline a solution is; or the power or potential of the hydrogen [H3O +] ion. pH stands for the negative logarithm of H3O + - or in short H+ - ion activity, in mol/L. pH = - log [H+] 
The underlying reason is the slight dissociation of water molecules: 2 H2O ⇄ H3O + + OH- 
In pure water at room temperature, the product of [H+] x [OH-] is equal to 1 x 10-14 mol2/L2.  
Thus, the pH of pure water is: pH = - log (1 x 10-7) = -(-7) = 7 
Keep in mind that the logarithmic scale includes a factor of 10 in regard to changes in concentration of H ion. For example, a solution which has a pH of 3 contains 10 times as many H+ ions as the same volume of a solution with a pH of 4, 100 times as many as one with a pH of 5, a thousand times as many as one of pH of 6, and so on.    - 169 - 
The scale of measurement is from 1 to 14. However, on a pH scale:  Reading of 7 is neutral  Reading of more than 7 is alkaline  Reading of less than 7 is acidic       
Aqueous solutions with higher [H+] than [OH-] are acidic, and will have pH values <7; basic solutions have pH > 7, i.e. [H+] < 1 x 10-7.  
The pH of rainwater is about 5.5-6.0. Typically, natural water has pH 6.5-8.5. Natural alkalinity is due to the dissolution of CO2 either of atmospheric nature or from carbonate rocks such as limestone and dolomite.  
Alkalinity is increased by caustic substances from industry (KOH, NaOH), soil additives in agriculture such as lime Ca (OH)2 , superphosphate which is mixture of Ca(H2PO4)2 and CaSO4, and soaps and detergents. Natural acidity is due to CO2 (g), HPO4, H2PO4, H2S, Fe, other acidic metal ions, proteins and organic acids. Increases in acidity can be due to acids used in industry, acid mine drainage, and acid rain.

The DI water should be freshly boiled, cooled, and free of CO2.  C. Distilled water (DI)  Boil and cool DI water having conductivity less than 2 μmhos/cm.  
Procedure 1. Calibrate the pH meter (see Box No.3 for more details) 2. Take a 50-mL water sample in 100-mL flask, Put the combined electrode in the water sample (about 3-cm deep). Take the reading after 30 seconds. 3. Remove the combined electrode from the sample, and rinse thoroughly with DI water in a separate beaker, and carefully dry excess water with a tissue. 
Technical Remarks 1. Make sure that the combined electrode contains saturated KCl solution and some solid KCl. 2. If the pH meter and combined electrodes are not to be used for extended periods of time, the instructions for storage published by the instrument manufacturer should be followed. 
However, Keep electrodes wet by returning them to storage solution, generally have a conductivity >4000 μmhos/cm, such as tap water (better substitute than DI water), pH 4.01 buffer is best for the single-glass electrode, saturated KCl is preferred for a calomel and 
Ag/AgCl reference electrode, and saturated KCl is the preferred solution for a combination electrode.  3. If there is adequate amount of water available for testing, discard the sample used for pH determination as it may be affected by slight leakage from types of saturated potassium chloride-calomel reference electrodes. If there is a limited supply of liquid for analysis, determine EC first, then pH; the same sample may subsequently be used for cation-anion analyses except K and Cl. 4. ACS-grade chemicals are generally satisfactory for preparing buffer solutions. 5. In preparing buffer solutions from solid salts, ensure complete dissolution. 9.2. Electrical Conductivity 
Electrical Conductivity (EC) is the measure of the ability of a solution to carry an electric current or the concentration of soluble salts in the sample at any particular temperature. The EC measurement is affected by dissolved CO2, turbidity, temperature and the nature of various ions, their relative concentration and the ionic of water.  
The EC is measured in the field or in the laboratory using a conductivity meter, which is basically a 
Wheatstone bridge that measures the resistance of the solution between two parallel platinum electrodes. Conductivities range from less than 0.02 dS/m for distilled water to more than 20 dS/m for highly saline waters.      - 171 - Apparatus Conductivity meter

A. Pre-treatment the conductivity cell 1. Calibrate the conductivity meter according to maker’s instructions (see Box No.4 for more details). 2. Rinse the conductivity cell thoroughly with DI water, and carefully dry excess water with a tissue. 3. Rinse the conductivity cell thoroughly with measured solution a few times. 
B. Measurement 1. Put about 75-mL water sample in a 100-mL glass beaker, and then put the clean and dried conductivity cell in the glass beaker. 2. Take the reading. The display will also need some time to stabilize before the reading. 3. Remove the conductivity cell from the glass beaker, rinse thoroughly with DI water, and carefully dry excess water with a tissue. 
Technical Remarks 1. It is essential that the manufactures instructions be followed.  2. Cleaning of the conductivity cell is needed if contaminated. 3. The reference temperature should be 25 °C, and the result expressed in dS/m. If the measurement is carried out at a different temperature, the result should be corrected to 25 °C. Check accuracy of the EC meter using a 0.01 N KCl solution, which should give a reading of 1.413 dS/m at 25 °C.  4. Readings are recorded in milli-mhos per centimeter (mmhos/cm) or deci-Siemens per meter (dS/m). The use of the unit deci-Siemens is preferred over the unit milli-mhos. Both units are equal, that is, 1 dS/cm = 1 mmho/cm.         - 172 - 9.3. Total Dissolved Solids 
Total Dissolved Solid (TDS) is defined as the substances remaining after evaporation and drying of a water samples. The remaining fraction is approximately equivalent to the total content of the dissolved and suspended matter in the water sample. Non-filterable residue corresponds to the Total 
Suspended Solids (TSS) and the filterable residue is the TDS.  Determination of TDS can be used to check the accuracy of analyses when relatively complete analysis has been made on a water sample. 
This is accomplished by comparing the value of calculated TDS with the measured value. Ion concentration, in mg/L of constituents, required to calculate the TDS are as follow:  
Calculated TDS= 0.6 (alkalinity) =Na+K+Ca+Mg+Cl+SO4+SIO3+ (NO3-N) +F 
The measured TDS concentration should be higher than the calculated value, because a significant contributor may not be included in the calculation. If the measured value is less than the calculated value, all values are suspect and probably in error. If the measured value is higher than the calculated value, the low ion sum is suspect and selected constituent should be reanalyzed. The acceptable ratio is:                                      Principle 
A well mixed, measured portion of a sample is filtered through a standard glass-fiber filter and the filtrate is evaporated to dryness in a weighed dish and dried to constant weight at 180 oC. The increase in dish weight represents the total dissolved solids. Apparatus

Continue suction for about 3 minutes after filtration is complete. 5. Transfer filtrate to a weighed evaporating dish (Wtd) and evaporate to dryness on a steam bath.  6. Dry for at least 1 hour in an oven at 180 oC, cool in desiccators, and weigh (Wtd+s). 7. Repeat the cycle of drying, desiccating and weighing until a constant weight is obtained or until weight loss between successive weighing is less than 4 % or 0.5 mg which is less.

Technical Remarks 1. It is necessary to report the specifications followed, e.g., TSS at …oC, type of filter and pore size or number. 2. Non-homogeneous particulates such as leaves, sticks, and lumps of fecal matter should be excluded from the sample. Too much residue on the filter will retain water and may require prolonged drying. 3. Long-term preservation of a sample is not practical; analysis should therefore begin as soon as possible. Transportation and short-term storage of sample normally does not affect the results of the test. 4. Volatile material in a sample can distort results.      - 176 - 9.5. Nitrogen 9.5.1. Ammonium Nitrogen and Nitrate Nitrogen 
In water and wastewater the forms of N of greatest interest are NO3-N, NO2-N, NH3 and organic forms of N. These N forms are interchangeable, being components of the N cycle. Ammonia is present naturally in surface water and wastewater. Its concentration is generally low in ground waters because it is adsorbed by soil particles and clay and is not leached readily from soils. Nitrate in groundwater is a major environmental and public health concern. Nitrates are converted to nitrites in the intestines. Once absorbed into bloodstream, nitrites prevent hemoglobin from transporting oxygen (older children have an enzyme that restores hemoglobin). High NO3-N levels in drinking water (>10 ppm) are linked with health problems (i.e., methemoglobinemia). Thus, while using water with high NO3-N. For human consumption should be avoided, such water is a suitable for irrigation as it is an additional source of nutrients. Principle 
Ammonium nitrogen and NO3-N plus NO2-N are determined by steam distillation, using heavy MgO for NH4 and Devarda’s Alloy for NO3 .The distillate is collected in saturated H3BO3 and titrated to pH 5.0 with dilute H2SO4.  Apparatus Distillation unit

Procedure 
A. Pre-treatment of the distillation unit 1. The distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7-8 mL distillate/minute. 2. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  
B. Distillation  1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not; titrate further aliquots until agreement is found. The H2SO4 normality is:                              3. Carry out distillations as follows: 
To determine NH4-N  Pipette 20 mL water or wastewater sample into a 100-mL distillation flask.  Pipette 1 mL saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL DI water into a 50-mL beaker (duplicate beakers).  Place the first beaker underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Add about 0.2 g heavy MgO, with a calibrated spoon, to the distillation flask.   Immediately, attach the distillation flask to the distillation unit with a clamp.    - 178 -  Start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, then lower the dish to allow distillate to drain freely into the Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker.  After 4 minutes, when 35-mL distillate or more is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask (first distillate).  Each distillation should contain at least two standards (pipette 20 mL 1.2 mg NH4-N from 
Diluted Stock Solution) and two blanks (pipette 20 mL 2 KCl solution).  Recovery of NH4-N should be at least 96 %. 
To determine NO3-N and NO2-N  Place the second beaker underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.  Immediately, add 0.2 g Devarda’s alloy, with a calibrated spoon, to the same distillation flask, then attach back to distillation unit with a clamp, and start distilling.  After 4 minutes, when 35-mL distillate or more is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask (second distillate).  Wash tip of the condenser into Pyrex evaporating dish or the beaker with a small amount of DI water.   Each distillation should contain at least two standards (pipette 20 mL 1.2 mg NO3-N from 
Diluted Stock Solution) and two blanks (pipette 20 mL DI water).  Recovery of NO3-N should be at least 96 %. C. Titration  
Titrate the first distillate (for ammonia) and the second distillate (for nitrate), separately, to pH 5 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using an Auto-Titrator. 
Notes  After finishing titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish.  Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect distillation flasks containing the water sample, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to distillation unit, and place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds. 
Steaming-out is done only between distillation for different samples, not between ammonium (MgO) and nitrate (Devarda’s alloy) in the same sample.

Technical Remarks 1. If possible, NH4-N and NO3-N should be determined immediately after sampling. If the analysis cannot be done immediately, water and wastewater samples may be kept refrigerated (4 °C). 2. All water for reagents and dilution should be NH3-free. DI water is usually satisfactorily. 3. Filter paper may contain traces of NH4, so the first 20-25 mL of filtrate should be discarded. 4. Never use acid preservation for samples to be analyzed for NO3 or NH4. 9.5.2. Total Nitrogen 
The Kjeldahl procedure is a good estimate of N content in the water or waste water samples. This procedure involves digestion and distillation. The water or waste water sample is digested in concentrated H2SO4 with a catalyst mixture to raise the boiling temperature and to promote the conversion from organic-N to ammonium-N, which is obtained by steam distillation, using excess 
NaOH to raise the pH. The distillate is collected in saturated H3BO3; and then titrated with dilute 
H2SO4 to pH 5.0 (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982). Apparatus Block-digester Distillation unit

This solution contains 1.2 g NH4-N/L (Stock Solution). Procedure 
A. Digestion 1. Pipette 20-mL aliquot of the water sample into a 100-mL calibrated digestion tube. 2. Add about 3.0 – 3.5 g catalyst mixture, a few pumice boiling granules, add 10 mL concentrated H2SO4 (in the fume hood) and then swirl carefully. Place the tubes in the rack and put a glass funnel in the neck of the tube. 3. Place the tubes rack in the block-digester, and slowly increase temperature setting to about 370 - 380 °C. The H2SO4 should condense about half-way up the tube neck; when solution clears, continue heating for about 3 hours.    - 181 - 4. Lift the tubes rack out of the block-digester, carefully place on a rack holder, and let tubes cool to room temperature. 5. Slowly add about 15 mL DI water to the tubes, cool, and bring to volume with DI water.  6. Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (DI water sample), and one chemical standard (DI water sample, pipette 1 mL Stock Solution). 
B. Distillation 1. Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust steam rate to 7 – 8 mL distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep distillate temperature below 22 °C.  2. Calibrate pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer), and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0.

Phosphorus compounds are present in fertilizers and in many detergents. If surprising a critical level in the soil, they are carried into surface waters, sewage, industrial wastes, and storm runoff. In contrast to N, inorganic P forms are highly reactive and do not readily leach through soils. High concentration of P compounds may produce a secondary problem in water bodies where algal growth is normally limited by phosphorus. In such situations, the presence of additional P compounds can stimulates algal productively and enhance eutrophication.  
Phosphorus occurs in natural waters and in wastewaters as phosphate. Groundwater rarely contains more than 0.1 mg/L phosphate if not polluted by organic matter. Phosphorus is essential to the growth of organisms and can be the nutrient that limits biological growth in water bodies.  Principle 
Phosphorus can be determined by vanadomolybdo phosphoric acid (colorimetric methods), where are the ammonium molybdate and potassium antimony tartrate react in acid medium with orthophosphate to form a heteropoly acid-phosphomolybdic acid- that is reduced to an intensely colored molybdenum blue by ascorbic acid. 9.6.1.

Prepare a standard curve as follows:  Pipette 2 mL of each standard (1-5 ppm), and proceed as for the samples.  Also make a blank with only DI water, and proceed as for the samples. 5. Read the absorbance of blank, standards, and samples after 10 minutes on the 
Spectrophotometer at 882 nm wavelength. 6. Prepare a calibration curve for standards, plotting absorbance against the respective P concentrations. 7. Read P concentration in the unknown samples from the calibration curve.      - 184 -

Technical Remarks 1. The required acid amount to acidify the water sample to pH 5.0 (using 5 N H2SO4). This can be done by taking 10 mL DI water and adding 2-3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator, if red color appears, add 5N H2SO4 till the color disappear. Then add the required amount of acid to all the water samples (adding 1 mL 5 N H2SO4 is adequate to acidify each 10 mL water sample). 2. If the sample solutions are too dark-colored for measurement against the highest standard, smaller water should be taken, and the calculation modified accordingly. Once the blue color has developed, the solution cannot be diluted. 3. Glassware used in P analysis should not be washed with detergents containing P (Most detergents contain P).  4. As glass tube density may vary, it is best to use the same tube (cuvette) for each absorbance reading on a spectrophotometer. 5. Interference: Arsenates (As) react with the molybdate (Mo) reagent to produce a blue color similar to that formed with phosphate. Concentrations as low as 0.1 mg As/L interfere with the phosphate determination. Hexavalent chromium (Cr) and NO2 interfere to give results about 3% low at concentrations of 1 mg/L and 10 to 15% low at 10 mg/L. Sulfide (Na2S) and silicate do not interfere at concentrations of 1.0 and 10 mg/L. 9.6.2. Total Phosphorus 
Organically-bound P and all phosphates forms are first converted to orthophosphate by an acid persulfate digestion. To release P from combination with organic matter, a digestion or wet oxidation is necessary. Principle

A. Digestion  1. Add a suitable aliquot of a well-mixed water sample (10 mL natural water sample), into a 250-mL calibrated digestion tube. Rinse the cylinder twice with DI water. 2. Add 5 mL concentration HNO3, and a few pumice-boiling granules, mix well, and then place tubes in the rack. 3. Place the tubes rack in the block-digester and gently heat to evaporate to about 15-20 mL (it takes 1-1.5 hour). 4. Cool, and then add 10 mL (2:1 ratio) concentration HNO3 and HClO4 mixture. 5. Again, place the tubes rack in the block-digester and slowly increase the block-digester temperature to 180 °C and digest the samples until dense white fumes of HClO4 appear (it takes 1.5-2 hours). 6. If solution is not clear, continue heating at the boiling temperature for 15-20 minutes longer. 
If necessary, add 10 mL more concentration HNO3to aid oxidation. 7. Cool the mixture, and add small amount of DI water, mix well, and then bring to 50-mL volume with DI water.

Read the absorbance of blank, standards, and samples after 10 minutes on the

V = Total volume of the water sample used for digestion (mL) 
V1 = Total Volume of the digest (mL) 
V2 = Volume of digest used for measurement (mL) 
V3 = Volume of flask used for measurement (mL)  Caution  
HClO4 is explosive in presence of easily oxidizable organic matter. Avoid this hazard by taking the following precaution: (a) do not add HClO4 to a hot solution containing high organic matter; (b) always pre-treat samples containing organic matter with HNO3 before adding HClO4.   
Technical Remarks 1. No interferences are normally observed for Cu, Fe, or Si. However, high concentrations of Fe can cause precipitation of, and subsequent loss, of P. 2. Arsenate may interfere when present at concentration higher than P. 3. Phosphate adsorbed on glass surface may affect measurements at low P levels. Use of acid washed glassware dedicated to this analysis prevents this interference.      - 187 - 9.7. Potassium 
Although potassium (K) is a relatively abundant element, its concentration in natural fresh waters is usually less than 20 mg/L. Brines and seawater, however, may contain as much as 400 mg/L K or more. Potassium in water can be determined by flame photometry. Principle 
The estimation of K is based on the emission spectroscopy, which deals with excitation of electrons from ground state to a higher energy state and coming back to its original state with the emission of light. Apparatus

Pipettes and volumetric flasks, as required for dilution and tests of interference effects Reagents 
Standard Stock Solution  Dry 3-5 g potassium chloride (KCl) in an oven at 120 °C for 1 – 2 hours and cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.   Dissolve 1.907 g dried KCl in DI water, and bring to 1-L volume. This solution contains 1000 ppm K (Stock Solution).  Prepare a series of Standard Solutions from the Stock Solution as follows:

Measure the water samples, take the emission reading on the Flame Photometer at 767-nm wavelength, and record the readings. 5. Switch off the Flame Photometer according to the maker’s instructions. 6. Draw a calibration curve. 7. Calculate K concentrations according to the calibration curve.       - 188 -

Technical Remarks  1. Check the performance of the photometer at frequent intervals by spraying some of the standard solutions and adjust the sensitivity as necessary. 2. If K concentration is higher than the top standard, make an appropriate dilution. If this is a dilution of the original sample, multiply by the appropriate factor.      - 189 - 9.8. Sodium 
Sodium (Na) is a common element, the sixth most abundant, and present to some extent in most natural waters. Sodium is present in a number of minerals, the principal one being rock salt (sodium chloride). The increased pollution of surface and ground water during the past decade has resulted in a substantial in the Na content of drinking water in different regions of the world. Sewage, industrial effluents, sea water intrusion in coastal area, and the use of Na compounds for corrosion control and water-softening processes all contribute to Na concentration in water because of the high solubility of sodium salts and minerals.  
Sodium levels in groundwater vary widely but normally range between 6 and 130 mg/L. In surface water the Na concentration may be less than 1 mg/L or exceed 300 mg/L depending upon the geographical area. Sodium may present a problem in drinking water if the Na in water exceeds 20 mg/L. Principle 
Sodium in the water sample can be determined by flame photometry emitting a sparkling yellowish red color. Reagents  
A. Lithium Chloride (LiCl), 1000 ppm  Dissolve 6.109 g dry LiCl in DI water, and bring to 1-L volume. This solution contains 1000 ppm LiCl (Stock Solution).  Dilute 100 mL Stock Solution to 1-L volume. This solution contains 100 ppm LiCl (Diluted Stock Solution). 
B. Standard Stock Solution  Dry 5 g sodium chloride (NaCl) in an oven at 110 °C for 3 hours, cools in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.  Dissolve 2.5418 g dried NaCl in DI water, and bring to 1-L volume. This solution contains 1000 ppm Na (Stock Solution)  Prepare a series of Standard Solutions from the Stock Solution as follows:

Where:     23 = Atomic weight of Na 
Technical Remarks 1. In the analysis of natural waters, the only ions which may cause serious interference to Na measurements is calcium; in some types of flames, this tends to enhance the Na emission and the effect may be measured for a range of Ca concentrations. 2. Sodium ratios and appropriate corrections applied or the interference may be neutralized by the addition of aluminum (Al) ion, usually as aluminum nitrate.       - 191 - 9.9. Calcium and Magnesium 
Calcium (Ca) is dissolved easily out of almost all rocks and is, consequently, detected in most waters. 
Magnesium (Mg) are relatively abundant in the earth’s crust and hence a common constituent of natural water. Waters associated with granite or siliceous sand usually contain less than 10 mg of calcium per liter and less than 5 mg magnesium per liter.  
Many waters from limestone areas may contain 30-100 Ca/L, and those associated with gypsiferous shale may contain several hundred milligrams per liter. But for the water in contact with dolomite or Mg-rich limestone may content 10-50 mg/L and several hundred milligrams per liter may be present in water that has been in contact with deposits containing sulfates and chlorides of magnesium.  Calcium and Mg contribute to the total hardness of water. It should be noted that the difference between total hardness and the Ca concentration can be used to calculate the magnesium concentration. However, some CaCO3 is desirable for domestic waters because it provide a coating in the pipes which protects them against corrosion. Principle 
EDTA-disodium salt solution is used to chelate Ca + Mg. Calcium is separately estimated by the versenate method using ammonium purpuate (Murexide) indicator, when the pH is made sufficiently high that the Mg is largely precipitated as hydroxide and an indicator is used that combines with Ca only. Thus, Mg can be obtained by deduction of Ca from Ca+Mg content. Both cations can also estimated by atomic absorption spectrophotometer.

An alternative preparation 
Standard stock can also be prepared by dissolving 0.735 g calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2.2H2O) in 1-L volume with DI water. Procedure 
A. Calcium 1. Pipette a suitable aliquot of water sample (10 mL natural water sample) into a 250-mL 
Erlenmeyer flask. 2. Dilute to 20 – 30 mL with DI water, add 2 – 3 mL 2 N NaOH solution, and about 50 mg ammonium purpurate indicator. 3. Titrate with 0.01 N EDTA. The color change is from red to lavender or purple. Near the end point, EDTA should be added one drop every 10 seconds since the color change is not instantaneous. 
B. Calcium plus Magnesium  1. Pipette a suitable aliquot of water sample (10 mL natural water sample), dilute to 20-30 mL with DI water. Then add 3-5 mL buffer solution.

In order to standardize the EDTA solution used in the determination of Ca and Mg:  Pipette 10 mL 0.01 N calcium chloride solution, and treat it as in determining Ca and Ca+Mg procedure, respectively.  Take the reading, and calculate EDTA normality:                          Where:

N = Normality of EDTA solution 
V = Volume of water sample used for measurement (mL) 
Technical Remarks 1. Normality with Ca determination usually is 3 to 5% higher than with Ca + Mg. 2. If an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer is used, a small aliquot of the water sample is sufficient to determine Ca and Mg. 3. Orthophosphate precipitates Ca at pH of the test. Strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) interfere with the Ca determination, and alkalinity in excess of 300 mg/L may cause an indistinct end point with hard waters. Under the conditions of the test, normal concentration of the following ions causes no interference with the Ca determination: Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Al, Pb, Cu, and Sn. 4. Calcium: Low Ca intake can be related to hypertension and cardiovascular disorders. There is a link between low Ca intake and osteoporosis. With a low level of Ca in the diet, drinking water may provide a significant portion of the daily Ca requirement. 5. Magnesium: An average adult ingests as much as 480 mg of Mg daily. Any excess amounts are quickly expelled by the body. No upper limit has been set for this metal in drinking water. 
It can, however, create a problem for people with kidney disease. They may develop toxic reactions to high levels of Mg, including muscle weakness, coma, hypertension, and confusion. 6. Hardness: In most water nearly all of the hardness is due to Ca and Mg, which react with soap to form precipitates .This in increases soap consumption, and react with certain constituents to form scale. As a general rule, a value less than 60 is considered soft, and values above 200 are considered very hard.      - 194 - 9.10. Carbonate and Bicarbonate 
Carbonates (CO3) and bicarbonates (HCO3) in water can be determined by titration a known volume of water against standard H2SO4 using phenolphthalein and methyl orange indicators, respectively. Principle Carbonates 
When the pH value of a sample of natural water is above 8.4, the CO3 is present, normally as sodium carbonate. The carbonate ion is converted to HCO3. The amount of acid used a measure of the carbonate present. CO3 + H = HCO3  Bicarbonate 
Bicarbonate ions react with mineral acid and release carbon dioxide (CO2) into the solution. HCO3+ H = H2O + CO2  
The pH value at complete neutralization being about 3.8, HCO3 ions are present. Thus HCO3 may be measuring by titration with mineral acid to a pH 3.8, either potentiometrically or using an indicator unaffected by CO2. Methyl orange is suitable and gives a good color change from green through grey (end-point) to red, which avoids the need for a matching buffer solution.

N = Normality of H2SO4 solution 
Technical Remarks  1. Standard HCl is used because H2SO4 may give rise to turbidity from calcium sulfate with Ca rich samples. 2. The alkalinity of water is a measure of its capacity to neutralize acids and is due primarily to the presence of bicarbonates. The acceptable alkalinity for municipal water supplies is generally between 30 and 500 mg/L as CaCO3, but there are many water supplies above and below these limitations. Waters with alkalinity greater than 500 mg/L as CaCO3 have objectionable tastes.       - 196 - 9.11. Chloride 
Chloride (Cl) anions are usually present in natural waters. A high Cl concentration occurs in waters that have been in contact with Cl-containing geological formations. Otherwise, high Cl content may indicate pollution by sewage or industrial wastes or by intrusion of seawater or saline water into a freshwater body or aquifer. A salty taste in water dependents on the ions with which the Cl are associated. With Na ions the taste is detectable at about 250 mg/L, but with Ca or Mg the taste may be undetectable at 1,000 mg/L. Chlorides being highly soluble is present in all waters but the amount is often very low in natural waters. High Cl content has a corrosive effect on metal pipes and structures and is harmful to most trees and plants.  Principle 
The determination of Cl is done by AgNO3 (Mohrs’s titration) method, which is based upon the fact that in solution containing Cl and chromate (Cr). Silver reacts with all the Cl and precipitates before the reaction with chromate begins. The appearance of the brick-red colour of the silver chromate precipitate is the end-point of the titration.

Procedure 1. Pipette a suitable aliquot of water sample (10 mL natural water sample) into a 250-mL 
Erlenmeyer flask. 2. Add 4 drops potassium chromate solution. 3. Titrate against AgNO3 solution until a permanent reddish-brown color appears. 4. In order to standardize the AgNO3 solution used in the determination of Cl:  Titrate 10 mL 0.01N NaCl solution against 0.01 N AgNO3 after adding 4 drops potassium chromate solution until a permanent reddish-brown color appears.   Take the reading, and calculate AgNO3 normality:                           Where:

V1 = Volume of 0.01 N AgNO3 titrated for the sample (mL) 
N = Normality of AgNO3 solution 
V = Volume of water sample used for measurement (mL) 
Technical Remarks 1. Natural waters are often low in Cl, and 10 mL is a suitable aliquot in most cases. 2. Saline waters may be high in Cl and 5 mL (or even less than 5 mL) may then be more appropriate aliquots. 3. The Cl estimation has two different purposes:  If the test is done regularly on a water supply and there is a sudden increase, it may indicate pollution due to ingress of sewerage or other chloride-rich wastes.   Many groundwaters have Cl content high enough to be of objectionable taste. By using the 
Cl test, the well with the lowest amount of Cl can be identified. If several well are being pumped, it can be planned in such a way that the lowest Cl content is obtained.      - 198 - 9.12. Sulfate 
Sulfate (SO4) is an abundant ion in the earth’s crust and its concentration in water can range from a few milligrams to several thousand milligrams/L. Industrial wastes and mine drainage may contain high concentration of SO4, which also results from breakdown of SO4-containing organic compounds. 
The SO4 is not a notably toxic anion; however, SO4 in water containing Ca forms hard scale in steam boilers. In large amounts, SO4 in combination with other constituents gives a bitter taste to water. 
Concentrations above 250 mg/L may have a laxative effect, but 500 mg/L is considered safe. The SO4 in water is determined normally by barium sulfate (BaSO4) precipitation. Apparatus

Filter solution through ashless filter paper, collect the BaSO4 precipitate on the filter paper, and then wash it several times with warm DI water until no trace of Cl remains. The presence of Cl in the filtrate can be checked by AgNO3 solution.  6. After washing, place filter paper with precipitate into a pre-weighed and dried porcelain crucible (Wt1), and put in an oven at 105 °C for 1 hour to dry. 7. Transfer crucible to a muffle furnace heated to 550 °C, and leave to dry ash for 2 – 3 hours. 8. Take crucible out of the muffle furnace, and place in a desiccator to cool, weigh crucible on an analytical balance, and take the reading (Wt2).      - 199 -

In most natural waters boron (B) is rarely found in concentrations greater than 1 mg/L, but even this low concentration can have deleterious the effects on certain agricultural products. Water having B concentrations in excess of 2 mg/L can adversely affect many common crops. However, where levels are greater than 5 mg/L, toxicity may occur. Groundwater may have a greater B concentration, particularly in areas where the water comes in content with igneous rocks or other B-containing strata.          The B content in many waters has been increasing as a result of the introduction of industrial waste and of the use of boric acid (H3BO3) and its salts in cleaning compounds. Ingestion of B at concentrations usually found in natural water has no adverse effects on humans. Ingestion of large quantities of B, however, can affect the central nervous system, while extended consumption of water containing B can lead to a condition known as borism.  
The hot-water procedure is still the most popular method for measuring B, and it was introduced by Berger and Truog (1939), and was modified by later researchers. The B is measured calorimetrically using Azomethine-H (Bingham, 1982).  Apparatus Erlenmeyer flasks

Box 7. Kjeldahl Method for Determining Nitrogen                                 
The Kjeldahl method involves three main steps: digestion, distillation, and titration.  a. Digestion 
Digestion is accomplished by boiling a homogeneous sample in concentrated sulfuric acid (H2SO4). The end result is an ammonium sulfate (NH4)2SO4 solution. The general equation for the digestion of an organic sample is: 
Organic-N + H2SO4 → (NH4)2SO4 + H2O + CO4 + other sample matrix by products b. Distillation 
Excess base is added to the digestion product to convert ammonium (NH4) to ammonia (NH3) as indicated in the following equation. The NH3 is recovered by distilling the reaction product. (NH4)2SO4 + 2 NaOH → 2NH3 + Na2SO4 + 2 H2O 
Ammonia sulfate + heat → ammonia gas c. Titration 
Titration quantifies the amount of NH3 in the receiving solution. The amount of N in a sample can be calculated from the quantified amount of NH3 ion in the receiving solution. There are two types of titration:         In back titration (commonly used in macro Kjeldahl), the NH3 is captured by a carefully measured excess of a standardized acid solution in the receiving flask. The excess of acid in the receiving solution keeps the pH low, and the pH does not change until the solution is “back titrated” with base. 2NH3 + 2H2SO4→ (NH4)2SO4 + H2SO4 
Ammonia + standard sulfuric acid → excess ammonium sulfate + sulfuric acid (NH4)2SO4 + H2SO4 + 2 NaOH → Na2SO4 + (NH4)2SO4 + 2H2O 
Ammonia sulfate + measured excess acid + measured sodium hydroxide → sodium sulfate + ammonium sulfate 
In direct titration, where boric acid is used as receiving solution instead of a standardized mineral acid, the chemical reaction is:  
NH3 + H3BO3→ NH4 + H2BO 3 + H3BO3 
Ammonia gas + boric acid → ammonium-borate complex + excess boric acid 
The boric acid captures the ammonia gas, forming an ammonium-borate complex. As the NH3 collects, the pH of the receiving solutions changes. 2NH4 + H2BO 3 + H2SO4 ((NH4)2SO4 + 2H3BO3 
Ammonium-borate complex + sulfuric acid + ammonium sulfate + boric acid     - 208 - 
Box 8. Irrigation Water Quality                   Box 6            
The concentration and composition of dissolved salts in any water determine its quality for irrigation.  Mostly the concerns with irrigation water quality relate to possibility of high salt concentration, sodium hazard, carbonate and bicarbonate hazard, or toxic ions (e.g., B or Cl).  
The analyses required for determining water quality include EC, soluble anions and cations.  As all of these determinations are more or less a routine matter for any soil-plant analysis laboratory, all laboratories in the WANA region can perform analyses for evaluating its quality for irrigation purposes.  The EC of irrigation waters is usually expressed in units of deci-Siemens per meter (dS/m) at 25oC. 
Calculations                                             Where:   
Na, Ca and Mg represent the concentrations in meq/L of the respective ions in water (or solution).                                                      
Where:  The anion and cation concentrations in water/solution are in meq/L. 
Thereafter, water quality can be determined by interpreting the data using the following guidelines: 
Quality EC  Sodium Adsorption Ratio Residual Sodium Carbonate   (dS/m)  (meq/L) Suitable <1.5 <7.5 <2.0     
Marginal 1.5 – 2.7 7.5 – 15 2.0 – 4.0     Unsuitable >2.7 >15 >4.0 
Boron concentration in irrigation water is considered safe only up to 0.7 ppm, while sodium and chloride concentrations of less than 70 and 140 ppm, respectively, are considered safe.      - 209 - 
Box 9. The “Feel” Method for Determining Soil Texture Class                                    Soil Texture Assessment Tests Moist-Cast Test  
Compress some moist soil by squeezing it in your hand. If the soil holds together (i.e., forms a cast), test the strength of the cast by losing it from hand to hand. The more durable it is, the higher the clay content. Ribbon Test 
Moist soil is rolled into a cylindrical shape and then squeezed out between the thumb and forefinger to form the longest and thinnest ribbon possible. Clay forms the longest, thinned ribbons. Feel Tests 
Graininess Test- Soil is rubbed between the thumb and forefinger to assess the sand percentage, where sand has a grainy feel. Silt, on the other hand, feels slippery.  
Stickiness Test- Soil is moistened and compressed between the thumb and forefinger. The degree of stickiness is determined by noting how strongly it adheres to the thumb and forefinger upon release of pressure, and how much it stretches. Shine Test 
A small amount of moderately dry soil is rolled into a ball and rubbed once or twice against a hand, smooth object such as a knife blade or thumbnail. A shine on the ball indicates clay in the soil.

Box 10. Salt and Sodium Hazard                                  SALINITY (Salt Hazard) 
Class 1, Low Salinity: Good water with little or no likelihood of salt accumulation when normal irrigation practices are followed 
Class 2, Medium Salinity: Can be used if a moderate amount of excess water is applied to provide some leaching. Plants with moderate salt tolerance can be grown without serious yield reduction when normal cropping practices are followed  
Class 3, High Salinity: Cannot be used on clay soils or soils with poor drainage. With adequate drainage, considerable excess water should be applied to provide leaching. Irrigations must be more frequent than normal and soil should be maintained relatively wet. Crops with medium or high salt tolerance should be grown to maintain normal yields. This water is not recommended for use under sprinkler application methods unless leaching is practiced.  
Class 4, Very High Salinity: Not suitable for irrigation under ordinary conditions. May be used occasionally on sandy soils with excellent drainage if considerable excess water is applied for leaching, and if crops with high salt tolerance are grown. Should not be used for continuous irrigation and is not suitable for use with sprinkler systems.  ALKALINITY (Sodium Hazard) 
Class 1, Low Sodium: Good water that can be used safely on most soils in Wyoming 
Class 2, Medium Sodium: Suitable for use on sandy and loamy soils if water moves through them readily. Can cause alkali problems on heavy clay soils, under low leaching conditions, unless gypsum (or equivalent soil amendments) are present or are added to the soil 
Class 3, High Sodium: May produce harmful levels of exchangeable sodium in all soils and will require special management -- good drainage, high leaching and additions of organic matter. 
Soils containing natural gypsum or other chemical amendments may make the water usable, but it is not feasible if the water is also high in salinity (Class 3 or 4). This water will cause surface soil particles to puddle, thus limiting water penetration.  
Class 4, Very High Sodium: Generally unsatisfactory for irrigation. Special conditions of low salinity water, favorable gypsum content of soils, high leaching and special management may permit use of this water. A complete soil analysis is recommended prior to any use of this water.      - 211 -

Appendix 7. Soil pH Levels and Associated Conditions 
Soil pH  Indications  Associated Conditions      < 5.5  Soil is deficient in Ca and /or Mg, and should be limed  Poor crop growth due to low cation exchange capacity and possible Al3+ toxicity.  Expect P deficiency.      5.5 – 6.5  Soil is lime-free, should be closely monitored.  Satisfactory for most crops      6.5 – 7.5  Ideal range for crop production.  Soil cation exchange capacity is near 100% base saturation.      7.5 – 8.4  Free lime (CaCO3) exists in  soil.  Usually excellent filtration and percolation of water due high Ca content on clays.  
Both P and micronutrients are less available.      >8.4  Invariably indicates sodic soil.  Poor physical conditions.  Infiltration and percolation of soil water is slow.  Possible root deterioration and organic matter dissolution.
