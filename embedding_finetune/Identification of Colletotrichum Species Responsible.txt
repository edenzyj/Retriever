Freeman, S., and Katan, T. 1997. Identification of Colletotrichum species responsible for anthracnose and root necrosis of strawberry in Israel. Phytopathology 87:516-521.
Strawberry anthracnose was observed for the first time in Israel in 1995. The disease reached epidemic proportions in Israeli nurseries and production fields in 1995 and 1996. Using morphological and cultural characteristics, the species responsible for anthracnose was identified as
Colletotrichum acutatum. A reliable semi-selective medium, amended with iprodione and lactic acid, was used to isolate the fungus from in fected tissues. In addition, C. acutatum was subsequently isolated from necrotic roots of stunted, chlorotic plants that exhibited no symptoms of anthracnose. High levels of the pathogen from naturally infested field soil and perlite growth substrate were quantified from the rhizosphere of diseased plants on the iprodione-amended medium. Both foliar- and root infecting isolates were equally pathogenic to strawberry, causing 95 to 100% plant mortality, when inoculated on roots and foliage. In comple mentation (heterokaryon) tests using nitrate nonutilizing mutants, 113 out of 115 isolates from different plant parts and locations belonged to a single vegetative compatibility group. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction of genomic DNA using four repetitive-motif primers produced nearly uniform amplified DNA banding patterns for 141 of the Israeli strawberry isolates from different sites, plots, plant tissues, and cultivars.
When compared to reference isolates from the US, these band patterns suggested that a single introduction of C. acutatum was responsible for strawberry anthracnose on foliage and necrosis of roots in Israel.

Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, a major disease of this crop. Principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleo morph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk) (19,28,29). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop bud and eventually crown rot, result in the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions are formed on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms are later manifested as ir regular and black leaf spot, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (19). Considerable yield loss can be inflicted by anthracnose un der the appropriate environmental and cultural conditions (18).
From May to September 1995 a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel (10,11). Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from Novem ber 1995 to June 1996 were crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This was the first record of strawberry an thracnose in Israel (10,11). Moreover, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, phenomena that are atypical of straw berry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from necrotic root tissues, although no foliar anthrac nose was observed.
Traditional methods for discriminating between species of Col letotrichum have relied primarily on morphology, such as size and shape of the conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, G. cingulata (16,29,31,32, 34). However, due to environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms, these criteria are not always adequate for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthrac nose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been used to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry an thracnose (13). Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable molecular method for differentiating between the Colletotrichum complex (14). Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens such as Fusarium oxysporum (5,20,22,25) and Colletotrichum spe cies (4,6,21,35). Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thereby constituting a distinct genetic population (9,23).
Strawberry anthracnose reached epidemic proportions in Israel during the 1995 to 1996 and current 1996 to 1997 growing sea sons (10,11). At the same time, plants exhibiting stunting, chlor osis, and root necrosis were observed in many production fields.
The main purpose of this work was to characterize the species of
Colletotrichum responsible for these symptoms and, more specifi cally, to determine whether anthracnose and root-necrosis diseases are incited by the same pathogen or different species. We charac terized 147 isolates of Colletotrichum from typical diseased plants as well as atypical stunted, chlorotic plants with root necrosis.
Vegetative compatibility tests with nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mu tants were used to study the genetic composition of the pathogen population. PCR was used to compare the isolates among them

Fungal cultures and growth conditions. The monoconidial
Colletotrichum isolates used in this study are listed in Table 1.
Reference Colletotrichum isolates C. acutatum (CA-310-1 and
CA-330-1), C. fragariae (CF-63-1), and isolates of two discrete genotypes of C. gloeosporioides (CG-315-1 representing genotype
Cgl-1, and CG-272-1 of genotype Cgl-2), were previously iden tified and characterized (14,16). All Israeli cultures were isolated from symptomatic, infected strawberry plants (fruit, vegetative parts, and roots) from different cultivars, sites, and plots during the 1995 to 1996 season. Infected plant parts were surface-disinfested (3% sodium hypochlorite) and plated on modified Mathur’s medium (MS; 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% bactopeptone, 1% sucrose, 0.25%
MgSO4·7H2O, 0.27% KH2PO4, 2% agar) (33) supplemented with 2.5 µg (a.i.) of iprodione (Rovral 50WP) per ml and acidified with 0.1% lactic acid to suppress growth of fungal contaminants and bacteria. Cultures were grown on MS at 25°C in the dark and characterized morphologically. Cultures were also transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) to verify identification.
Quantification of the pathogen in the rhizosphere and roots of diseased plants. During January 1996, 4 months after trans planting, field soil (from three commercial fields in the Sharon region) and perlite growth substrate (from a breeding plot at the
Volcani Center) were collected from the rhizosphere of naturally infected plants showing symptoms of stunting and chlorosis. Soil and perlite samples (5 g each and replicated five times) were agitated in 45 ml of sterile distilled water for 30 min and dilution plated on supplemented MS to determine the number of CFU per gram of soil.
Eighty diseased plants (twenty each from the three fields and twenty from the perlite substrate) were assessed for presence of the pathogen in roots. Five necrotic root segments (each 1.5 cm long), chosen at random from each plant, were surface-disinfested and plated on the supplemented MS. Plates were incubated at

Foliar and root pathogenicity assays. Six-week-old straw berry plants (certified disease-free, Rahan nursery, Israel) of two cultivars (Chandler and Sharon) were used for foliar- and root inoculation experiments. Plant foliage was inoculated by spraying conidial suspensions (106/ml) of two fruit isolates (TUT-106A and
TUT-110A), two root isolates (TUT-127A and TUT-137A), and a water control until runoff. Ten plants of each cultivar were inocu lated with each isolate separately, and maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C, under natural daylight conditions. Disease progress was assessed as the percentage of plant mortality after 7 to 10 and 30 days. The experiment was conducted twice.
Plant roots (Chandler and Sharon cultivars) were inoculated by dipping in conidial suspensions (106/ml) of two fruit isolates (TUT 106A and TUT-110A) and two root isolates (TUT-127A and TUT 137A) for 10 min, 4 h, and 18 h periods. Plants were then trans ferred to pots (15 cm diameter) in a peat/tuff (volcanic ash) (1:1, vol/vol) medium. Ten plants of each cultivar were inoculated with each isolate separately with comparable water controls. Plants were maintained in the greenhouse under conditions identical to those described for the foliar inoculations. Percentage of plant mortality was determined 21 days after inoculation for each treatment. Per centage of infected roots was calculated as described. The ex periment was conducted three times consecutively over a 3-week period, dictated by the availability of plants for inoculation. Re sults of the three experiments were pooled. Statistical analysis of plant mortality following root inoculation with different isolates and dipping periods was performed by two-way analysis of vari ance, using the SAS statistical program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC). 
Vegetative compatibility grouping. Puhalla’s minimal nitrate agar (MM), a sucrose-salt medium containing nitrate as the nitro gen source (25), was used to recognize nit mutants and for com plementation (heterokaryon) tests. Chlorate media, based on MM or PDA amended with KClO3 (15 or 25 g/liter, respectively), were used to generate nit mutants (5,25). Plates (9 cm diameter) of chlor ate media were centrally inoculated with small mycelial plugs and incubated at 24 to 27°C. Fast-growing sectors emerging from the restricted colonies were transferred to MM plates (5 cm diameter) and examined after a 4-day incubation period. Colonies with a thin expanding mycelium were considered nit mutants. Partial pheno type characterization of nit mutants was attempted using nitrite, hypoxanthine, and ammonium media (2,5,21). Complementation between nit mutants was tested on MM as described (21). Hetero karyons were usually evident within 10 to 15 days. When mutants of two different isolates formed a heterokaryon, their parent iso lates were assigned to the same vegetative compatibility group (VCG).
Isolation and purification of fungal DNA. Liquid cultures comprising 100 ml of MS in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with five mycelial disks derived from colony margins.
The cultures were agitated for 5 to 6 days on a rotary shaker (150 rpm, 25°C), and fragmented 12 h before harvesting the mycelia by blending for 10 s at 24,000 rpm with a tissue homogenizer (Ultra
Turrax T25, Janke & Kunkel, IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Ger many) to stimulate new growth. Mycelia were collected by vac uum filtration and lyophilized until dry. DNA was extracted and purified as previously described (13). The DNA was dissolved in 0.5 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) to an approximate concentration of 200 to 500 µg/ml, and diluted to a concentration of 10 to 100 ng/ml for PCR. 
PCR amplification. For arbitrarily primed PCR (ap-PCR), pri mers were derived from microsatellite or repeat sequences as fol lows: CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG (26), TGTCTGTCTGTCTGTC (13), GACACGACACGACAC (17), GACAGACAGACAGACA (36). In the text, these primers appear as (CAG)5, (TGTC)4, (GA
CAC)3 and (GACA)4, respectively. PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 10 to 100 ng genomic DNA, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega, Madison, WI), and 1 µM primer. The reactions were in cubated in a Hybaid thermocycler (Hybaid Ltd., Teddington, Eng land), beginning with 5 min of denaturation at 95°C, followed by 30 cycles consisting of 30 s at 95°C, 30 s at either 60°C [for (CAG)5] or 48°C [for (GACA)4, (GACAC)3, and (TGTC)4], and 1.5 min at 72°C. Amplification products were separated in agarose gels (1.5%, 15 × 10 cm) in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer (27) by electrophoresis at 80 V for 2 h. Ap-PCR experiments were conducted at least three times for 141 isolates and two additional times for representative and reference isolates, with identical results being reproduced.RESULTS 
Characterization of Colletotrichum isolates originating from typical anthracnose-diseased and atypical, stunted plants. One hundred, forty-seven monoconidial isolates (one per plant) were characterized (Table 1). Of these, 127 were obtained from crown, stolon and fruit tissues of anthracnose-affected plants of six culti vars collected in seven commercial plots at four sites. The remain ing 20 isolates were obtained from decaying roots of stunted chlor otic plants of three cultivars, collected in four plots at three sites.
Approximately 100 diseased plants showing symptoms of stunt ing and chlorosis were unearthed for visual examination of crowns and roots. These plants did not exhibit foliar symptoms of an thracnose. All crowns were apparently healthy, whereas most of the roots were necrotic with brown discoloration (Fig. 1). Colleto

MS. When roots were plated on nonsupplemented MS, contami nating Alternaria spp. often suppressed Colletotrichum growth.
Healthy plants did not yield C. acutatum growth from roots as op posed to the presence of contaminating Alternaria spp.
All isolates from different parts of diseased strawberry plants (roots, vegetative parts, and fruits) produced masses of salmon-or ange acute conidia (average size 15 × 4 µm) in dense white my celium. This morphology is typical of C. acutatum grown on sup plemented MS or PDA. 
Quantification of C. acutatum in roots and the rhizosphere.
The roots and rhizosphere of diseased plants growing in soil or perlite growth substrate, which were stunted, chlorotic and had a decayed and necrotic root system, were assessed for C. acutatum colonization by plating on supplemented MS. Root segments of all tested plants yielded colonies of C. acutatum. Percentage of root infections were 56 ± 8 and 60 ± 12 for field and perlite grown plants, respectively. However, the level of C. acutatum in the rhizosphere of plants in perlite growth substrate was approxi mately 2.5 times higher than that in field soil (18,750 ± 3,375 and 7,600 ± 2,150 CFU/g, respectively).
Foliar and root pathogenicity assays. Four C. acutatum iso lates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom develop ment could be affected by the source of the isolate. The tested isolates, regardless of whether they originated from roots or fruits, caused typical anthracnose symptoms on petioles, leaves, and sto lons of both cvs. Chandler and Sharon 7 to 10 days after inoc ulation. After 30 days, 100% mortality of all foliar-inoculated plants was observed, as compared to 0% for the water control plants, which remained healthy thereafter.
The effects of isolate origin and duration of root dipping on plant mortality were examined with cvs. Chandler and Sharon. A mor tality rate of 90 to 100% was recorded in both cultivars after dip ping roots for various periods (10 min, 4 h, or 18 h) in conidial suspensions of isolates originating from roots and fruits (Table 2).
Surviving plants exhibited symptoms of stunting and chlorosis.
Root segments from the necrotic tissue of the killed plants, plated on supplemented MS, were 100% infected with C. acutatum. Ex tended, continuous dipping of roots for 4 and 18 h in water alone caused considerable plant mortality of 15 and 40% respectively, possibly due to anaerobic conditions, because no contamination by C. acutatum was observed after root plating (Table 2). Mor tality of plants caused by each isolate at each dipping duration differed significantly (P < 0.001) from the water controls. The in teraction of isolate and dipping duration was significant (P = 0.019), whereas no significant differences were observed in plant mor tality for each isolate at each dipping duration (P = 0.05) (Table 2).
Vegetative compatibility grouping of isolates. A group of 10 isolates was chosen for the initial test of vegetative compatibility.
Three isolates of this group (TUT-5954, TUT-232:1, and TUT 232:2) were obtained from plant clinics, and seven were from sto lons (TUT-8V, TUT-9A, TUT-73A, and TUT-75A) or crown tissue (TUT-6AB, TUT-7E, and TUT-22A) of diseased plants from two locations (Table 1). A total of 112 nit mutants were obtained from these isolates. Attempts to phenotype the mutants by growing them on media containing nitrate, nitrite, hypoxanthine, or ammonium as the nitrogen source (2,5,21) were unsuccessful: their growth on both nitrite and hypoxanthine was leaky to profuse, and differ ences, if any, were uncertain.
The mutants of each isolate were first paired among themselves to determine complementation within isolates, and 16 representa tive mutants were then paired in all possible interisolate combina tions. All mutants formed stable complementary heterokaryons with at least some of the other mutants, and the pattern of heterokaryon formation indicated that all 10 isolates belonged to a single VCG. nit mutants were generated from an additional 105 isolates and paired with representative complementary mutants of the first group.
Formation of complementary heterokaryons indicated that 103 of these isolates belonged to the VCG defined by the first group, whereas isolates TUT-111A and TUT-742D were heterokaryon self-incompatible (2). A total of 39 randomly chosen mutants were divided into seven complementation groups comprised of 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 7, and 20 mutants. The largest group (Table 3: group A) probably consists of nit1 mutants, whereas the others should in clude one group of nit3 and five groups of NitM mutants (22).
Results of approximately 700 pairings between 16 mutants repre senting the seven complementation groups, and random nit mu tants from the 113 vegetatively compatible isolates of this study, are summarized in Table 3. Complementary heterokaryons were obtained in half of the pairings with group A mutants and in all pairings with group F and G mutants, whereas 86 to 99% of the pairings with mutants of groups B through E resulted in comple mentation. Consequently, any pair of mutants from different com plementation groups B through G (Table 3) could serve as useful and dependable representatives of the local population of C. ac utatum from strawberry in vegetative compatibility tests.
Comparison of Colletotrichum isolates by ap-PCR. Israeli iso lates were categorized according to site, plot, cultivar, and straw berry-tissue origins (Table 1). Genomic DNA of 121 Israeli isolates from crown, fruit, and stolons were amplified by ap-PCR using four oligonucleotide primers, (CAG)5, (GACA)4, (TGTC)4, and (GACAC)3. Amplicons for each primer were nearly identical for

Amplicons of the representative Is raeli isolates were identical to those of the two U.S. C. acutatum isolates with primer (GACA)4, and distinctly different from the C. fragariae and two C. gloeosporioides isolates (Fig. 2A). Similar results were observed with primers (TGTC)4, (CAG)5, and (GAC

Ap-PCR was also performed with DNA from an additional 20 isolates from diseased roots and compared to C. acutatum refer ence isolate CA-330-1. Identical amplicons were obtained using primer (GACA)4 (Fig. 3), with slight differences between U.S. and
Israeli isolates using primers (CAG)5, (TGTC)4, and (GACAC)3 (data not shown).DISCUSSION 
The main aim of this research was to identify the species of
Colletotrichum responsible for the first outbreak of anthracnose disease in Israel, and to determine whether the same or different species incited root necrosis in strawberry nurseries and produc tion fields here. In a morphotaxonomic comparison, isolates from aboveground parts of anthracnose-affected plants and from ne crotic, decayed roots of stunted chlorotic plants were uniform in appearance and classified as C. acutatum. Isolates from fruits and roots were equally pathogenic in artificial inoculations, suggesting that anthracnose and root necrosis were incited by the same path ogen. Isolates from all plant parts, including roots, were vegeta tively compatible with one another, manifesting uniformity of the pathogen population. Likewise, the population was uniform in mol ecular DNA analyses, and its classification as C. acutatum was confirmed by comparisons with reference cultures of the major strawberry Colletotrichum pathogens.
Abundant anthracnose infestation was evident in many nur series during the summers of 1995 and 1996. This resulted in massive collapse of transplants in soil-fumigated fields. Plants that die during the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced by new transplants. Moreover, because plants are aligned with the drip-irrigation system, the replacement plants are planted in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, there by increasing inoculum density considerably. This was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symp toms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil and to the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with a decayed root system were not infected by systemic inva sion of inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). Root necro sis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, although lesion development has been noticed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Moreover, the pathogen was able to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel have shown that populations of C. acu tatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable incidence (S.
Freeman, unpublished data). Therefore, the prospect of persistent soil contamination by a soilborne inoculum of C. acutatum seems unlikely, especially because soil fumigation is standard practice.
Although disease symptoms caused by the three major species,
C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, are similar, it is of paramount importance to identify the causal agent of disease for regulatory and breeding purposes, as well as for the selection of control measures. For example, isolates of C. gloeosporioides are sensitive to benzimidazole fungicides as opposed to isolates of
C. acutatum, which are not (1). Similarly, the slow-growing orange strains of C. acutatum are more tolerant to benomyl than the fast growing gray forms of C. gloeosporioides, both of which affect

Vol. 87, No. 5, 1997  521 citrus (3,24). Molecular tools have been successfully utilized to differentiate between the species of Colletotrichum responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Isolates of C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and
C. gloeosporioides infecting strawberry were distinctly different in nuclear and A+T-rich DNA analyses, and ap-PCR (13,14). Sim ilarly, sequencing and restriction digest analyses of PCR-amp lified rDNA have been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species from strawberry (12,30). In pop ulations of C. acutatum and C. fragariae from strawberry, little genomic variation existed within each species using various mol ecular methods (13,14). In contrast, high diversity was observed in populations of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry, which pos sess the perfect stage (6,12,14,16). However, C. acutatum isolated from strawberries in Europe were discrete from American straw berry isolates (30). Likewise, isolates of C. acutatum from other hosts, e.g., peach and pecan, were discrete from the strawberry pathogen, which suggests that C. acutatum is not a uniform group (15). The uniformity of C. acutatum strawberry isolates in Israel, as illustrated by population grouping based on vegetative compati bility, suggests that the recent disease outbreak was due to a single introduction of the pathogen to Israel. The uniform ap-PCR pro files further indicate that these isolates belong to an asexually re producing clonal population of apparent U.S. origin.
C. acutatum causing strawberry anthracnose is predominantly a pathogen of fruit, stolons and crowns. However, as demonstrated in this work, under the appropriate environmental, agrotechnical, and epidemiological conditions the pathogen can cause severe stunt ing and mortality of plants by infecting the root system.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
