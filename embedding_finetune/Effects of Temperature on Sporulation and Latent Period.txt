Anthracnose of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) has become a major constraint on strawberry production in the
United States (8,15). All strawberry plant parts can become infected and yield losses can be substantial (18). The disease is pri marily caused by Colletotrichum acutatum
J. H. Simmonds, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz., and C. fra gariae Brooks, although Gloeosporium spp., Glomerella cingulata (teleomorph of
C. gloeosporioides), and C. dematium also have been shown to cause infection (1,3, 14,30,32,33). Although there has been con siderable controversy about the taxonomy of the genus (13,31), recent isozyme and molecular evidence confirm the uniqueness of the three primary species (2,28). Within the last few years, C. acutatum has become the dominant species infecting strawberry fruit in many parts of the United States (9, 12,38). Often, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae are associated with infection of parts of the plant other than fruit, but both are capable of infecting and rotting fruit (15,36).
The extensive use of fungicides often is required to manage this disease (15,18), and methods for reducing the number of spray applications or better timing of fun gicides are needed. Disease forecasting, based on environmental conditions, may help improve spray timing and achieve a more sustainable production system (5, 19).
The epidemiology of C. acutatum in
Ohio has been extensively studied, and research has focused on the effects of envi ronmental conditions on infection, spore germination, splash dispersal, and disease spread (20,21,35,37,38). Madden et al. (20) investigated the effect of ground cover and ambient weather conditions on the spread of anthracnose in Ohio. They determined disease incidence in strawberry plots with different ground covers (plastic, straw, or bare soil) and elucidated, by stepwise re gression analysis, those weather variables most correlated with disease incidence.
The best regression model describing dis ease incidence was based on rain amount (cm), days since introduction of inoculum, an index of infection (0 to 1 scale) based on wetness duration and temperature, and distance from spore source (20). Only half of the variation of disease incidence was explained by the equation. They suggested that inoculum production, along with other factors, would account for unexplained variability. Although results from several studies indicated the potential importance of sporulation in the epidemiology of C. acutatum (20), there are no reports quanti fying the sporulation of this pathogen.
Moreover, there is very little epidemiologi cal research on C. fragariae and C. gloeo sporioides on strawberry.
The long-term goal of this work was to help understand why C. acutatum has only recently become the dominant fruit-rotting pathogen and to provide information that could eventually be used for the timing of fungicide applications. The specific objec tives of this study were to (i) determine the latent periods and sporulation of Colle totrichum spp. infecting strawberry fruit in relation to temperature and incubation time, (ii) compare the sporulation and la tent period of selected isolates of three
Colletotrichum spp., and (iii) quantify sporulation and latent period in relation to temperature and incubation time with the use of regression analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODS
Inoculum production. Isolates of C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeospori oides were obtained from infected straw berry fruit from different regions of the
United States (Table 1). All cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in 100 × 15 mm petri dishes. Conidia from 2-week-old cultures were streaked onto new PDA plates every week with the use of a sterilized probe. To maintain patho genicity of the isolates, conidia from pre viously inoculated fruit were streaked onto new PDA plates every 2 weeks. Cultures were maintained at 26°C with 12 h of light (51 µE s–1 m–2) per day.
Inoculum for fruit inoculations was pre pared by scraping plates and suspending conidia in 20 ml of deionized water. The spore suspensions were vortexed for 1.5 min, then adjusted to 2.5 × 104 conidia/ml with the use of a hemacytometer. Based on the results of preliminary experiments, this was the lowest spore density that resulted in 100% fruit infection.
Plant maintenance. Strawberry plants (cv. Midway), obtained as transplants from
Brittinghams Nursery (Salisbury, MD), were grown in 15-cm-diameter pots con taining a mixture of sand, peat, and steam ABSTRACT
King, W. T., Madden, L. V., Ellis, M. A., and Wilson, L. L. 1997. Effects of temperature on sporulation and latent period of Colletotrichum spp. infecting strawberry fruit. Plant Dis. 81:77 84.
Effects of temperature on sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae, causes of anthracnose of strawberry, were determined in controlled-environment studies. Detached immature fruit were inoculated with a conidial suspension and incubated up to 36 days at constant temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C. Latent period (time to first sporulation) depended on temperature and ranged from 2 to 3 days at 25°C to 6 to 17 days at 5°C. C. acutatum had a shorter latent period than the other species at 5 and 10°C; at higher temperatures, latent periods of the species were very similar. During the first 4 days of sporula tion, there was an optimum-type relationship between the logarithm of conidia per fruit [log(Y)] and temperature, with maximum observed sporulation (generally 106 to 107 conidia per fruit) from 15 to 30°C. Sporulation increased over time at temperatures of 15°C and above. The great est difference among the species was at 5 and 10°C, where tested C. acutatum isolates produced from 10 to 100 more conidia per fruit than the other species. Polynomial regression equations were used successfully to represent log(Y) as a function of temperature and incubation time. The rate of increase in sporulation over time was a function of temperature, with a predicted opti mum of 22 to 26°C. Equations were validated by predicting sporulation of the three species in fecting fruit attached to plants growing in controlled-environment chambers. Although the pre dictions tended to be slightly larger than observed, mean error [100(observed – predicted)/ observed] was only –0.7% (95% confidence interval: –2.4 to 1.0%).

Agricultural Research and Development
Center (OARDC), Wooster, OH. Tem perature in the greenhouse ranged from 16 to 26°C. Natural sunlight was supple mented with artificial lights for 16 h daily.
Plants were watered with deionized water each day and were fertilized biweekly with
Peters 20-20-20 N-P-K fertilizer (660 µg/ ml).
Sporulation in detached fruit. General methods were similar to those in Madden et al. (21) and Yang et al. (37,38). Fruit, with pedicels intact, were detached from strawberry plants when at the white stage, which is when chlorophyll breakdown oc curs. The fruit were rinsed in 70% ethanol for 2 min and then placed in plastic tubs (24 × 24 × 10 cm) containing steel mesh.
The pedicel of each fruit was placed through the mesh and submerged in water to reduce fruit dessication.
Fruit were inoculated by spraying them with an atomizer until runoff (21,37). Lids were placed on the tubs to maintain free moisture on the fruit surface and relative humidity (RH) above 80%. RH was meas ured in a separate tub without fruit by placing wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermistors immediately over the mesh. RH and tem perature were recorded with a Campbell
CR-21 Micrologger (Logan, UT). Tubs were placed in an incubator set at 26°C for 24 h. Lids of the tubs were then removed and the tubs were placed in an incubator set at one of the following temperatures: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35°C. Temperature was recorded every 10 min to ensure con sistent conditions. Duration of incubation ranged from 2 to 36 days, depending on the temperature (see Results). The sporulation of C. acutatum OH, C. acutatum MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL (Table 1; see Table 1 for isolate designa tion definitions) was evaluated for all seven temperatures. Sporulation of the other isolates was evaluated only at 15, 20, 25, and 30°C.
The latent period was assessed as the time from inoculation until lesions ap peared on any of the fruit. During prelimi nary studies, it was found that lesion ap pearance coincided with time of first sporulation (16).
For sporulation assessment, five fruit were randomly taken from the tubs at the temperature-dependent sampling times.
Fruit weight was determined and the per cent area of lesions covering the fruit was estimated visually for each fruit for C. acutatum OH and MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL. Each individ ual fruit was placed in 50 ml of deionized water and agitated for 1.5 min. The fruit was removed, and the spore suspension was vortexed for 1.5 min. Four 10-µl sam ples were placed on a hemacytometer, and the density of conidia per milliliter was calculated. The mean of the samples was used to represent each fruit. Each test was done at least three times. Each species, isolate, and temperature combination was tested in random order.
Effects of free surface moisture on sporulation. A limited set of temperature/ incubation time combinations were tested with the OH and MS isolates of C. acuta tum, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeo sporioides FL, to determine if free mois ture on strawberry fruit affected sporula tion. Procedures were the same as in the previously described experiment, except that the lids remained on the tubs during the entire incubation period. Fruit were also lightly misted daily with an atomizer, but no run-off was visible. The experiment was conducted at three temperatures: 20, 25, and 30°C. Sporulation at selected incu bation times was assessed as described above and compared with sporulation at the same times for infected fruit without free moisture. The differences in sporula tion [in log(conidia); see data analysis, below] were divided by log(conidia) for the tests without free moisture, and then multiplied by 100 to achieve a percentage scale.
Sporulation on attached fruit. Sporu lation on infected fruit attached to plants was assessed for C. acutatum OH and MS,
C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides
FL in order to validate results from de tached fruit studies. Strawberry plants were grown in the greenhouse as described above. Plants were chosen when the fruit were at the white stage. Inoculation proce dures were similar as those of Wilson et al.
(35) and as previously described here, ex cept that the pedicels of the fruit were held as fruit were sprayed with the atomizer.
Immediately after inoculation, plants were placed in a controlled environmental chamber (Rheem Manufacturing Company,
Asheville, NC) and misted for 24 h with a
Hermidifier mister (Hermidifier Co., Lan caster, PA); the plants were then moved to another chamber, which was set at one of the following temperatures: 15, 20, 25, or 30°C. Lights were turned on (190 µE s–1 m–2) for 14 h daily. RH averaged 40 to 60% in the chamber. Five fruit were sam pled starting when lesions appeared, and sporulation was assessed as described above. Sporulation assessment was contin ued from 2 to 28 days, depending on the temperature. All four temperatures were not evaluated for all isolates because of limitations to plant production in the greenhouse, and the number of incubation times varied. Each test was conducted from one to three times.
Data analysis. The effects of tempera ture (T) and incubation time from the start of sporulation (I) on conidia produced per fruit (Y) were quantified by regression analysis (19, 23). Regression models were developed assuming the following: (i) an optimal-type relationship between Y and T, i.e., where Y increased to a maximum and then decreased; and (ii) a monotonic (in creasing or decreasing) relationship be tween Y and I, where the minimum value for Y was zero. Logarithmic polynomials models (4,23) were fitted to the sporulation data.
An overall regression model for each isolate (see below) was based on separate regression analysis for each T. At each temperature, log(Y) was regressed on I or log(I + 1) to determine the most appropri ate simple equation for sporulation over time. The logarithmic function of Y was chosen to stabilize variances in sporula tion. Moreover, to help determine the most appropriate relationship between Y and T, log(Y) for the first 4 days at which sporu lation occurred (called “initial sporulation” here) was regressed on polynomials of temperature (without a term for time).
Each tested equation used two of the fol lowing terms: T, T 2 , T 3 , and T 4 . Separate regression equations were calculated for each species and isolate.
An overall polynomial model for sporu lation, based on the above results, was de veloped with the general form log(Y) = f(I,T) (equation 1), in which f(I,T) repre sents a linear function of some of the fol lowing terms: I, log(I + 1), log(I + 1)T, log(I + 1)T 2 , log(I + 1)T 3 , and log(I + 1)T 4 . Randomness and normality of re siduals were evaluated as described in

Neter et al. (23) to test whether equations were appropriate for representing the data and whether statistical assumptions were not. The significance of the model coeffi cients (estimated parameters) was deter mined by t tests. Coefficients of determi nation (R2) and R2 adjusted for degrees of freedom (Ra 2) were calculated to measure the proportion of variation explained by the models. Regression analysis was done for each repetition of the experiments sepa rately and for the pooled data for each spe cies and isolate.
The square root of the mean square error [the standard error about the line (s) for the best-fitting regression equation] was used to calculate a standard error of the differ ence (SED) and least significant difference (LSD) between means.
Latent period (L) was modeled with the equation log(L) = b0 + b1T + b2T 2 (equation 2). As with the equation for sporulation, this equation was fitted to the data for each species and isolate. Evalua tion of the model results was the same as for the sporulation equation.
Fruit weight (W) and estimated percent area of fruit covered with lesions (A) were correlated with log(Y) for the OH and MS isolates of C. acutatum, the MS isolate of
C. fragariae, and the FL isolate of C. gloeosporioides. Separate correlation coef ficients were calculated for each isolate.
The best-fitting model for sporulation of detached fruit was used to predict sporula tion on attached fruit in controlled-environ mental chambers. T and I were based on conditions with attached fruit (in the con trolled-environment chamber), but model parameters were obtained from the de tached-fruit studies. A prediction interval was determined for each T and I combina tion with methods in Neter et al. (23).RESULTS
Effects of temperature and incubation time on sporulation. An optimum-type relationship was found between tempera ture and sporulation. During the first 4 days after sporulation began, conidia pro duction of all isolates was lowest at 5 and 10°C and increased until an optimum tem perature of 15 to 25°C was reached (Fig.
1). Sporulation generally decreased at or above 30°C. Colletotrichum acutatum CA,
CT, and OH produced about 107 conidia per fruit at 25°C. The two C. acutatum isolates also produced substantially more spores at low temperatures (5 and 10°C) than the tested isolates of the other two species. For instance, C. acutatum OH and
MS produced 4.0 × 105 conidia per fruit, while C. gloeosporioides FL and C. fra gariae MS produced about 103 and 104 conidia per fruit at 5°C, respectively.
From 15 to 30°C, the C. acutatum iso lates generally had similar sporulation (Fig. 1A). The major difference was C. acutatum CA at 15°C, in which there were less than 106 conidia per fruit produced, on average. The two C. fragariae isolates sporulated similarly over 15 to 30°C (Fig.
1C). However, the C. gloeosporioides iso lates had a large difference at 30°C (Fig.
1B), where the NC isolate produced more than 10 times the number of conidia per fruit as the FL isolate.
Sporulation of C. acutatum OH and MS,
C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides
FL was virtually constant over time at both 5 and 10°C (Figs. 2 and 3). As tempera tures increased (≥15°C), sporulation in creased over time for the isolates tested.
The C. acutatum isolates produced more spores at low temperatures over time (Fig.
2A,D) than isolates of the other two spe cies (Fig. 3A,C). After sporulation began, maximum sporulation during the first 4 days occurred around 25°C. At much longer incubation times (at least 14 days), maximum sporulation occurred at 15°C for
C. acutatum CT and MS (Fig. 2B,D), C. gloeosporioides FL (Fig. 3A), and C. fra gariae MS and NC (Fig. 3C,D). However, these long durations could not be tested at higher temperatures because of fruit degra dation.
Data analysis of sporulation. The polynomial equation that best described the logarithm of sporulation per fruit [log(Y)] in relation to incubation time at each tem perature was log(Y) = b0 + b1log(I + 1) (equation 3), in which b0 and b1 are pa rameters (16; results not shown). Gener ally, a significant and positive relationship was evident between log(Y) and log(I + 1) at the middle temperatures (15 to 30°C).
Slopes (b1) were significantly greater than zero (P < 0.05), and R2 values at middle temperatures were generally higher than values at the extreme temperatures, re flecting the higher slopes at the middle temperatures (23).

CA) indicate the state of origin. Least signifi cant differences (P = 0.05) for C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae = 0.31, 0.33 and 0.45, respectively, in log units.

See Table 1 for definitions of isolate-designation abbreviations. 80  Plant Disease / Vol. 81 No. 1 
Early sporulation (i.e., within the first 4 days after the beginning of conidia pro duction) was best represented by log(Y) = b0 + b1T + b2T 3  (equation 4), in which b0, b1, and b2 are parameters (Table 2). This equation with linear and cubic temperature terms provided the best fit to data for each species and isolate. Although R2 values were relatively low, the statistics represent the fit of the model to individual replicate data over the 4 days and not just the means as shown in Figures 1 to 4. R2 values ranged from 11.9 to 52.2%. Based on indi vidual F tests, there were significant dif ferences in the model results among the three species (P < 0.05) (Table 2). F tests also indicated that there were differences among isolates within a species (P < 0.05), reflecting the differences in means de scribed in the previous section. However, there were no significant (P > 0.10) differ ences in model results among repetitions.
The polynomial model that best de scribed sporulation was of the form log(Y) = b0 + b1I ′T + b2I ′T 3  + b3I ′  (equation 5), in which b0 to b3 are parameters (Table 3).
To improve interpretation, I ′  = log[I + 1] + 1 was used instead of simply log(I + 1) so that the time variable (I ′ ) was not zero on the first day of sporulation (i.e., I ′  = 1 when I = 0 or log [I + 1] = 0). This addi tion of a constant (“1”) does not affect the regression goodness-of-fit results. Equa tion 5 was based on the combined results with equations 3 and 4. Residuals had a random pattern and were normally distrib uted. The model showed a linear and cubic relationship between logarithm of sporula tion and temperature, as well as a linear relationship between logarithm of sporula tion and logarithm of time. There was sig nificant difference among and within the species (P < 0.05) and some terms were not always significantly different from zero for some isolates. Results shown in Table 3 include only significant terms. There were no differences among repetitions (P > 0.10).
R2 values were 63, 55, 71, and 54% for
C. acutatum OH, MS, CA, and CT, re spectively (Table 3). As with other analy ses, these statistics are based on individual replicate data, and not on means. C. fra gariae MS and NC and C. gloeosporioides had similar R2 values. The b2 parameter of

Plant Disease / January 1997  81 equation 5 was generally negative, indi cating the decline in sporulation at the highest temperatures. The exception was when the b1 parameter estimate was not significantly different from zero, and omitted from the equation, b2 was positive (C. fragariae NC; Table 3). The b1 and b3 parameters had an inverse relationship; i.e., b3 was negative when b1 was above 0.158, not different from zero when b1 was be tween 0.060 and 0.158, and positive when b1 was below 0.060.
Equation 5 can be rewritten as log(Y) = b0 + I ′ (b1T + b2T 3  + b3) (equation 6), to show the linear relationship between loga rithm of sporulation [log(Y)] and trans formed incubation time (I ′ ), with a slope (b1T + b2T 3  + b3) that was dependent on temperature.
Fruit weight, lesion area, and free surface moisture effects on sporulation.
There were low and nonsignificant (P > 0.20) correlation coefficients between fruit weight (W) and sporulation based on an analysis of the data described above. Cor relation coefficients were –0.17, –0.08, 0.04, and 0.15 for C. acutatum OH, C. acutatum MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL, respectively.
There was a positive and significant cor relation (P < 0.05) between sporulation and estimated percent area (A) of fruit covered by lesions. Correlation coefficients were 0.47, 0.70, 0.63, and 0.31 for C. acutatum
OH, C. acutatum MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL, respectively, showing the relationship between lesion size and conidia numbers. Very similar re sults were found for individual tempera tures.
Sporulation with free surface moisture on fruit surfaces was similar but somewhat less than sporulation without surface mois ture. The decline in sporulation was not greatly affected by the species or the iso lates. C. acutatum MS and OH produced an average of 11.6 and 16.3% fewer con idia, respectively, on fruit with free surface moisture than without. C. gloeosporioides
FL and C. fragariae MS produced 15.7 and 10.1% fewer spores, respectively.
Latent period. Latent period (L) de creased as temperatures increased (Fig. 4).
Latent period ranged from 6 to 17 days at 5°C and from 2 to 6 days at temperatures from 25 to 35°C. The C. acutatum isolates had shorter latent periods than isolates of the other two species at lower tempera tures. For instance, at 5°C, latent period averaged 7 and 11 days for C. acutatum
MS and OH, respectively, but averaged 17 days for C. fragariae MS and 14 days for
C. gloeosporioides FL. At 25°C, latent pe riod for all of the isolates, except for C. acutatum MS, was 2 days. From 20 to 35°C, latent period was quite similar for all isolates and species.
Latent period was best described by equation 2 with R2 values above 90% for all isolates (Table 4). All coefficients were significantly different from zero and there were significant differences (P < 0.05) in the coefficients among isolates and species, mostly due to differences in L at low tem peratures.
Sporulation on attached fruit. There was not a wide enough range of tempera tures and incubation times in the con trolled-environmental chambers to develop a quantitative (i.e., regression) relationship between sporulation on attached fruit and environmental variables. However, sub stantial sporulation occurred at all tem peratures/time combinations evaluated (Table 5). In most cases, measured sporu lation was similar to that predicted by equation 5 (Table 3) with the parameters estimated with detached fruit. In almost all cases, the 95% prediction interval, based on the model results for detached fruit, in cluded the observed sporulation values.
Error in prediction of sporulation was determined as 100[(observed – predicted)/ observed], represented in log units for each

Sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. in fecting strawberry fruit was strongly influ enced by temperature and incubation time.
In general, there was an optimum-type re lationship between conidia production and temperature, with maximum sporulation near 25°C, especially within 4 days of the initiation of conidia production (Fig. 1).
There was also increasing conidia produc tion over time, especially at temperatures above 10°C, and numbers of conidia were correlated with percentage of fruit covered by lesions. Furthermore, time to first sporulation (i.e., latent period) was greatly affected by temperature, with a decreasing latent period as temperature increased.
Sporulation of the three species was qualitatively similar but quantitatively dis tinct, as indicated by the different esti mated regression coefficients. The greatest difference occurred between species at 5 and 10°C, where C. acutatum had consid erably higher sporulation than the other two species (Figs. 1–3). Moreover, C. acutatum had a shorter latent period at these low temperatures (Fig. 4). However, only single isolates of C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae were tested at tempera tures less than 15°C. Around 25°C, there was little difference in conidia production among all isolates. The greatest difference in sporulation was for C. gloeosporioides
FL, which had a lower sporulation than the others. Likewise, latent periods were very similar at 25°C.
A polynomial regression model (equa tions 5 or 6) was found to be adequate for describing sporulation (on a log scale) of the isolates of the three species in relation to temperature and incubation time (Table 3). A polynomial model (equation 2) also provided an excellent description of latent period in relation to temperature (Table 4).
Although R2 values were relatively low, these values were based on fitting the equations to individual replicate data, not the means. Ra 2 values were close to the R2 values, indicating that terms in the model (equation 5) were all significant (23).
The change in sporulation [on a log scale; log(Y)] with incubation time was best represented by a logarithmic function of time, that is, log(I + 1) in equation 3 and
I′ [log(I + 1) +1] in equation 5. This is be cause, at some temperatures, log(Y) ini tially increased quickly at short incubation times and then more slowly at longer times (see Figures 2 and 3). As indicated by equation 6, the rate of increase of log(Y) (i.e., slope) was a direct function of tem perature. The maximum slope, and hence the maximum sporulation, is estimated by
Topt = (–b1/3b2) 1/2, where b1 and b2 are given in Table 3. Topt is predicted to be 24.1, 23.5, 26.2, and 22.2°C for C. acuta tum OH, MS, CA, and CT, respectively, 26.7°C for C. fragariae MS, and 24.3°C for C. gloeosporioides FL. Because of the small number of temperatures tested for the other isolates, estimates of Topt are not meaningful based on these estimated model parameters. The optima were simi lar and not significantly different from each other. For some isolates (e.g., C. gloeosporioides FL) at long incubation times, the highest sporulation was ob

Plant Disease / January 1997  83 served at 15°C. However, such long incu bation times were tested only for relatively low temperatures due to the rapid fruit deg radation and decay above 20°C. At shorter times, greater sporulation always was ob served at 25 than at 15°C. Regression analysis results (equation 6; Table 3), showing that the slope was directly related to temperature, confirmed that optimum temperature was in the 22 to 26°C range.
Although the most detailed data collec tion and analysis done in this study used detached fruit, similar results were ob tained with infected fruit still attached to plants (Table 5). With four isolates and a limited selection of temperatures and incu bation times, conidia production on at tached fruit was fairly well predicted by equations developed for detached fruit.
Although the 95% prediction interval al most always included the observed value, the intervals were wide because of the variation in the detached fruit data. How ever, the average difference between ob served and predicted log(Y) was only –0.037 (standard error = 0.057), showing the overall closeness of the predicted spor ulation to the observed. This mean differ ence in log units corresponds to a ratio of median observed to predicted spores (not log of spores) of 0.92; i.e., prediction tended to be slightly higher than observed values. Differences could be attributed to the lower RH in the chambers with plants compared with the containers with de tached fruit, as well as physiological dif ferences between detached and attached fruit.
Wilson et al. (35) previously studied the effect of temperature and wetness duration on the infection of mature and immature strawberry fruit by the Ohio isolate of C. acutatum. They found a similar relation ship between fruit infection and tempera ture as found here for sporulation. There was linear increase in logit-transformed fruit disease incidence and wetness dura tion with a slope that was a polynomial function of temperature. Optimum tem perature was between 25 and 30°C. Rela tionships between epidemiological proc esses (i.e., infection, sporulation) and tem perature and/or wetness duration for Col letotrichum spp. have also been studied with other hosts. For instance, Denham and
Waller (6) observed an increase in disease incidence in citrus caused by C. gloeo sporioides, with an increase in wetness duration after rain events occurring during blossoming periods. Field studies on dis ease incidence, along with assessments of flower development, blossom patterns, and climatic data, were used in their observa tions. Fitzell et al. (10) developed a poly nomial model based on laboratory studies that predicted infection of mangoes by C. gloeosporioides var. minor based on both temperature and wetness duration. The model accounted for 87% of total variation based on laboratory results. A similar rela tion was found by Dodd et al. (7). Opti mum temperature for infection was around 25°C. Similar results for optimum tem perature were found for other crops (22, 26,27). For instance, Nair and Corbin (22) incubated pine needles (Pinus radiata) with conidia of C. acutatum f. sp. pinea and noted that conidia germinated within 6 h at an optimum of 25°C, with appressoria formation following within 24 h. O’Con nell et al. (26) reported that conidia of C. truncatum, which infects pea (Pisum sati vum), germinated within 4 h of incubation at 25°C, and appressoria formed 10 to 15 h afterward. Timmer and Zitko (34) did not find a relationship between temperature and postbloom fruit drop of citrus, caused by C. acutatum, but their study was based on correlations of field observations. It is possible that the Florida ambient tempera tures were relatively close to the optimum during the growing seasons, and thus would not be correlated with disease in the field.
Surprisingly, free surface moisture was not required for sporulation. Free moisture is required for infection of fruit by C. acutatum (35) and is needed for sporula tion of many other fungal pathogens of fruit (11,17). Related to this, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that density of conidia in acervuli of C. graminicola, cause of anthracnose of corn, was greater under high RH than low RH due to lack of dessication of the spore matrix. Although research has been reported on spore germi nation and dispersal (24,29,37,38), sur prisingly, there have been few published reports on the influence of environmental conditions directly on spore production.
Thus, it is not known if other Colleto trichum spp. are affected by moisture in a similar manner. We speculate that the pathogen obtains sufficient moisture from the ripening strawberry fruit to produce conidia.
As with sporulation, latent period was described by a polynomial function of tem perature (equation 2). With this equation, the estimate of optimum temperature for L is given by –b1/2b2. With the estimated parameters in Table 4, optimum tempera ture for C. acutatum was predicted to be 26 to 29°C, with one exception. Due to the small numbers of temperatures tested, es timated coefficients for other species are not reliable. In general, no clear differ ences among isolates or species could be found in latent period around the optimum temperature. Although these estimated temperature optima for latent period are not significantly different from each other, they were similar to the optimum for in fection (35). However, there was a trend for these temperature values to be some what larger than the estimated optima for sporulation found here.
Results from this study, along with works from previous researchers, may ex plain the increasing importance of C. acu tatum in the north (15,20). Once intro duced in an area, C. acutatum could have distinct advantages over other strawberry infecting species of Colletotrichum at cooler temperatures, conditions that are normal for northern regions. Two of these advantages are the short latent period for
C. acutatum, and the greater production of spores at lower temperatures.
