Dispersal of fungal plant pathogens by rain splash or wind is the critical component in epidemic development of many diseases. 
Yet, splash dispersal has been infrequently studied compared to wind dispersal, until recently. Over the past 12 years, we have studied the splash dispersal of Phytophthora cactorum and Colletotrichum acutatum at three hierarchical levels: splash from sin­ gle water-drop impactions, spore transport with simulated rain over small areas, and disease spread in the field with naturally occurring rain. Number of splash droplets produced, number of spores disseminated, and flight distance of the splash droplets all increase with increasing size (and hence velocity and kinetic energy) of impacting raindrops. However, transport distance is very short, generally < 15 cm in each splash event, indicating that deposition of spores on a potential infection site is a result of con­ tinual re-splashing of spore-carrying droplets across the soil surface or ground cover, and through the canopy. Thus, characteris­ tics of the ground cover and plant canopy can have a dramatic effect on resulting disease spread; increasing roughness of the sur­ face and leaf area index of the canopy reduce splash dispersal. Very short rain durations (e.g. < 2 min) can result in substantial dispersal, but rain intensity [mm/hj has a complicated (nonlinear) relationship to dispersal, since increasing rain intensity leads to both increased removal of spores from the source but also loss of spores through the soil and canopy.

La dispersion des parasites des végétaux par les éclaboussures de pluie ou le vent est un facteur critique du développement épidémique de plusieurs maladies. Cependant, jusqu'a ces derniers temps, la dispersion par les éclaboussures n'a été que spo radiquement étudiée par comparaison a la dispersion par le vent. Durant les 12 dernières années, nous avons étudié la dispersion, par les éclaboussures, du Phytophthora cactorum et du Colletotrichum acutatum a trois niveaux hiérarchiques : l'éclabousse ment suite a 1'impact d'une goutte d'eau, le transport des spores par une pluie artificielle au-dessus de petites surfaces, et la dis persion de la maladie dans le champ par la pluie naturelle. Le nombre d'éclaboussures produites, le nombre de spores disséminés et la distance parcourue par les éclaboussures augmentent avec la grosseur (et par conséquent la vélocité et l'énergie cinétique) des gouttes de pluie. Cependant, la distance de transport est tres courte, généralement moins de 15 cm a chaque éclaboussement, ce qui indique que l'atterrissage des spores sur un site d'infection potentiel est le résultat d'éclaboussements répétés de gout telettes portant des spores au travers du terrain et du couvert végétal. Ainsi, la nature du terrain et du convert vegetal peuvent avoir un effet important sur la dispersion de la maladie; en augmentant la rugosité de la surface du sol et la densité du couvert végétal, on reduit la dispersion par les éclaboussures. Des pluies de tres courtes durées (i.e. < 2 min) peuvente avoir une disper­ sion appreciable, mais l'intensité de la pluie augmente a la fois la dispersion originale des spores et la perte de spores a travers le sol et le couvert végétal. 
Rain splash is the critical component in the develop­ ment of many plant diseases (Fitt & McCartney 1986). Although there may be more fungal pathogens with spores dispersed by wind than by rainfall (Gregory 1973), it could be argued that the occur­ rence and duration of rain episodes limit epidemics caused by rain-dispersed pathogens more than the movement of air limits epidemics caused by wind dispersed pathogens. That is because rain episodes are sporadic or even chaotic events compared to the movement of air. Surprisingly, despite the importance of splash dispersal, the physical details of rain splash have only been recently studied in detail (Fitt & 
McCartney 1986, McCartney & Fitt 1985, Madden 1992). 
Fitt and McCartney (1986) and Fitt et al. (1989) describe many of the characteristics of rain-splash dis­ persed fungi. Spores often are thin walled, hyaline, surrounded by mucilage, and may be produced in pyc nidia, acervuli, or on stromata. Many important dis­ eases of legumes are caused by these types of fungi. 
Examples are ascochyta blight, caused by Ascochyta fabae f. sp. lentis (pycnidia), and anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum truncatum (acervuli) (Morrall 1997). Understanding these diseases depends, in part, on understanding pathogen dispersal. 
The purpose of this article is to describe some of the key features of rain splash dispersal. For the most part, examples will be taken from our previous and ongoing experiments with anthracnose of strawberry, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, and leather rot of strawberry caused by Phytophthora cactorum. Our studies have dealt with dispersal at three levels: splash from single water-drop impactions, spore transport with simulated rain over small areas, and disease spread in the field. 225 D ow nl oa de d by  [ N at io nw id e

Splash from single water-drop impactions 
The events that occur when a raindrop impacts a surface depend on the mass and energy of the drop and the properties of the surface (Harlow & Shannon 1967, 
Hobbs & Kezweeny 1966, Walklate et al. 1989). 
Generally, if a drop has sufficient kinetic energy (KE), splash droplets are formed which travel in ballistic tra­ jectories short distances from the impact site (Macdonald & McCartney 1987). KE is directly pro­ portional to drop mass (m) times velocity (V) squared. 
Because drop mass (or volume) is a direct function of drop diameter (Dfcm]; m = (TT76)D3 ), and terminal velocity (m/s) can be approximated by a power func­ tion of D (V = 17.7D2/3), raindrop size is the first determinate of whether or not a splash will occur. 
Raindrops vary between 0.02 and 0.5 cm in diame­ ter, with most being less than 0.2 cm (Ulbrich 1983). 
However, most splashes are caused only by the large drops (>0.2 cm). Obviously, surface properties great­ ly affect results (Fitt et al. 1992). Splash from a dry target depends on the surface inclination, flexibility, and whether the surface is hydrophilic or hydropho bic. Generally, if the surface is covered with water, the splash droplets consist of a mixture of the surface water and the impacting drop. If there are spores on the target or in the surface water film, some of these will be entrained in the splash droplets (Fitt et al. 1989). Surface microtopography (i.e. roughness) also has a tremendous influence on splashing (Yang et al. 1990b, Yang & Madden 1993, Madden 1993), with magnitude of the splash distance increasing with declining roughness. 
To summarize, when a drop of diameter D impacts on a lesion or spore suspension, n splash droplets are produced, with diameters between d{ and du and size distribution f(d), a proportion p of these droplets con­ tain spores, the droplets travel an average of x cm, and there is an average of 5 spores per droplet (of those with any spores). Generally, 5 and p are func­ tion of d [s(d)\ p(d)], with s(d) increasing according to the log, square root, or cube root of d (Fitt et al. 1989, Madden 1992, Yang et al. 1992). 
Recently, Huber et al. (1996) developed a very ele­ gant probabilistic model for total number of splashed spores as a function of n, f(d), p(d), s(d). Splash droplets are quite small (often, d<0.05 cm, on aver­ age), and their distribution has a high positive skew ness, that is, there are many small droplets and very few large droplets. Most droplets travel very short distances (<15 cm), and the distribution of x \f(x)] is also positively skewed (Yang et al. 1991b). Flight distance is a function of droplet size, with the larger distances traveled by the smaller droplets. Thus, spores are transported very short distances because the largest splash droplets, which contain the majority of spores, travel only a few centimeters. 
The proportion of droplets with spores [p or p{d)\ and density of spores per droplet [s or s(d)] vary and are highly dependent on the pathogen, even under the same plant and surface conditions (see Fitt et al. 1989). For P. cactorum sporangia, p and s are very low (p = 0.3, s = 10-60), but these are very high for 
C. acutatum conidia (p = 0.8, s = 20-11 000) (Yang et al. 1992). Typically, p, s, n and x increase with increasing D or kinetic energy of the impacting drop. 
For many of these splash variables, V (a function of 
D) is a good predictor of mean results, although the physical principles are not yet resolved. 
Spore transport with simulated rain 
Rain and rain simulation. The distribution of raindrop diameters is a direct function of rain intensi­ ty / (mm/h). That is, the number of drops of any diameter D in a unit volume of air per unit diameter interval [N(D)] can be predicted from / by the so called Marshall-Palmer equation or one of its gener­ alizations (Ulbrich 1983). Most researchers now con­ sider N(D) to be well represented by a gamma distrib­ ution. The distribution is positively skewed, with more small drops than large ones. Integration of a function of N(D) can be used to determine the num­ ber of impacting drops or total kinetic energy of the impactions (equation A4 in Madden et al. 1996). 
Because of these mathematical results and the strong functional relation between / and N(D), one can, in theory, relate the results from single-drop impactions to the population of raindrops of various sizes impacting during some unit of time. 
Rain simulation is a popular method for studying rain-splash dispersal (Fitt et al. 1986b, Reynolds et al. 1987). Since splash droplets travel such short dis­ tances, the dispersal process can be effectively stud­ ied in relatively small areas. At Ohio State 
University, we use a wide-angle spray nozzle on a rotating boom to generate uniform rain over a 1.2 xl.2 -m area (Madden 1992, Reynolds et al. 1987). 
By selecting the proper nozzles and water pressures, rains are simulated that roughly match the cumulative volume distribution of natural rains from about 2 to 60 mm/h (Madden et al. 1996). 
Infected fruit studies. Using exposed immature strawberry fruit as a bioassay for dispersal, we have found that high levels of splash dispersal occur with very short rain durations (Fig. I). For instance, fruit infected by C. acutatum are found at 30 cm from the inoculum source in as little as 30 sec of rain (at 15 mm/h) (Madden et al. 1992). By 2 min of rain, over 50% of the fruit become infected. Percentages are lower at 60 cm from the source, as expected based on dispersal gradients from point sources (Campbell & 
Madden 1990). The percentage of fruit infected by P. cactorum is less than for C. acutatum, but high fruit D ow nl oa de d by  [ N at io nw id e

MADDEN: LEGUME DISEASES/FUNGAL SPORE DISPERSAL 227 Rain Duration (min) 
Figure 1. Incidence of strawberry fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum at 30 and 60 cm from the inoculum source with a gener­ ated rain intensity of 15 rara/h and rain durations of 0.5 to 16 min (adapted from Fig. 1 in Madden et al. [1992]). Rain durations were chosen to be equally spaced on a log2-scale and are graphed on a log scale. Statistical analyses are given in Madden et al. (1992). incidence is found after more than 4 min of rain (Madden et al. 1992). 
The fruit bioassay has been used to explore the effects of several factors on dispersal (Yang et al. 1990b, Madden 1993, Madden et al. 1992, Reynolds et al. 1987). For instance, a 2-m/s wind roughly dou­ bles fruit disease incidence downwind compared to upwind (at 60 cm). With a 7° surface inclination, dis­ ease incidence downhill from the inoculum source is roughly double the value for uphill. Surface rough­ ness also greatly affects fruit infection, with highest incidence for plastic and lowest incidence for straw mulch (Madden & Ellis 1990, Yang et al. 1990b). An originally unexpected result was that increasing rain intensity does not necessarily lead to increased dis­ ease incidence (Madden & Ellis 1990, Yang et al. 1990b). 
Using the rain simulator, we found that susceptible plant parts do not have to be present when the origi­ nal spore dispersal occurs (Madden et al. 1992). The inoculum source fruit and entire surface can be exposed to rain, the source fruit removed, healthy (target) fruit added, and the entire surface rained on for another 4 or 16 min (Fig. 2). Sufficient spores are released from the source over a few minutes to be resplashed and deposited onto healthy fruit during subsequent rains. 
Effects of surface topography and plant density. 
Although using infected fruit as a measure of spore dispersal is convenient, it does not provide high enough resolution spatially or temporally to charac­ terize dispersal for some studies. A more complete measure of spore dispersal would be to count and measure individual splash droplets (as we do for single drop studies), and microscopically determine number of spores per droplet. This approach is done 
Duration of Rain Prior to Fruit Exposure (min) 
Figure 2. Incidence of strawberry fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum at 30 and 60 cm from the inoculum source at 16 min of simulated 15-mm/h rain, with either no pre-rain (label "0") or 4 or 8 min of pre-rain ("4" or "8" labels). For a pre-rain, the surface and inoculum source were rained on (4 or 8 min), and then the inoculum source was removed and healthy fruit added for an addi­ tional rain of 16 min over the entire area. For no pre-rain ("0"), the inoculum, healthy fruit, and entire surface were rained on for 16 min (i.e. source fruil were not removed). Statistical analyses are given in Madden et al. (1992). at Rothamsted (Fitt & Lysandrou 1984, Fitt et al. 1986a, Fitt at al. 1989), but it is very time consuming. 
As an alternative, we developed a method where splash droplets are collected in 'gravity samplers' consisting of petri dishes with a medium selective for 
Colletotrichum spp. (Yang et al. 1990a). Calibration studies show that about 65% of deposited spores form colonies under a wide range of rain conditions. 
Using this measure of spore deposition, we have characterized how surface topography and plant den­ sity affect splash dispersal. 
Because of the short-range nature of splash events, most splash droplets with spores would only be deposited on infection sites after multiple resplash ings. Since each splash involves an interaction of the water drop (or droplet) and the surface, properties of the surface should have a large and multiplicative effect on the results (Madden 1992). We have shown that surface roughness, measured as the standard deviation of elevation (crE), (Huang & Bradford 1992), is an excellent predictor of the magnitude of splash dispersal (Yang et al. 1990a, Madden 1992). 
Steepness of the dispersal gradient is directly related to CTE (Fig. 3). Moreover, the integrated total number of colonies over the entire experimental area during the rain episode (X) increases with decreasing crE. 
These results are supported by other experiments showing that the number and mass (volume) of splashed water droplets increase with decreasing roughness (Yang & Madden 1993). The overall dynamics of colony numbers (and hence spore depo­ sition) with time and distance can be described by a diffusion equation (Yang et al. 1991a).

Figure 3. Average number of colonies of Colletotrichum acuta­ tum in relation to distance from an inoculum source for three sur­ faces, plastic, soil, and straw. Colony numbers are normalized so that all three curves have the same value at distance of 0. Slopes of the relation between ln(colonies cm"2 min1) and distance squared are -0.5, -1.1, and - 2.3/cm2 for plastic, soil, and straw, respectively (Yang et al, 1990a). Adapted from Yang et al. (1990a), where sta­ tistical analyses are described. of the physical mechanisms involved in the effect of surface-roughness is given in Madden (1992). 
Boudreau and Madden (1995) demonstrated that plant density also has a large effect on splash disper­ sal. Plant density was manipulated in two rows of strawberries, and I was significantly related to leaf area index (LAI) of the canopy, but in a nonlinear manner. For example, I increases with an increase in 
LAI from 0.9 to 1.8; X then greatly decreases as LAI increases to higher values (Table 1). Moreover, plac­ ing the inoculum within the canopy drastically reduces I compared to the inoculum source being outside the canopy (Boudreau & Madden 1995). 
Besides altering the transfer of droplets across the surface (as with surface roughness), the canopy is postulated to both reduce spore removal from the source fruit and resplashing of droplets by the direct interception of the incident rain. 
Effects of rain intensity. Previous studies have been ambiguous regarding the effects of rain intensity on splash dispersal (e.g. Madden & Ellis 1990, Yang

In some cases, increasing rain intensity reduced disease inci­ dence, even though higher intensities are associated with larger raindrops, and large drops disperse more spores than small drops (Yang et al. 1991b, Huber et al. 1996). However, these prior studies cannot fully characterize rain intensity effects, either because only a small number of (generally high) intensities were tested, or because the generated rains did not mimic naturally occurring ones in drop volume distributions. 
By generating rains with intensities of 2-60 mm/h (1.2-4.9 mL cm"2h'), that also reasonably duplicated drop volume distributions of natural rains, we were able to quantify the relationship between rain intensi­ ty and dispersal of C. acutatum (Madden et al. 1996). 
Total number of colonies (for a circular area with radius of 100 cm over 46 min) increased linearly with rain intensity (Fig. 4). However, proportion of infect­ ed fruit (in a fruit bioassay for dispersal) increased with rain intensity to about 3.5 mL cm"2 h~' with the simulator and then declined somewhat (Fig. 4) (also see Fig. 3 in Madden et al. 1996). The reason for the decline can be found by partitioning rain splash into three interrelated components: 1) spore removal from the source, 2) splash droplet transport (measured by the volume of splashing water), and 3) spore wash off from potential infection sites and removal from the system. All three components increased with increasing rain intensity, demonstrating that although more spores are released and transported throughout the system with increasing intensity, more are also 900 S 600 c o o o 75 3 0 0 .<3 A /% 1 .

MADDEN: LEGUME DISEASES/FUNGAL SPORE DISPERSAL 229 washed-off of healthy fruit. The combined effects being that increasing rain intensity may actually reduce disease incidence. Disease spread in the Held 
As one would expect, epidemics of diseases caused by splash-dispersed pathogens typically are associ­ ated with rain events. However, as discussed previ­ ously (Madden 1992, Madden et al. 1996), efforts to quantify properties of rain with disease outbreaks or rates of disease development have had mixed results. 
That is, given that rain has occurred, weather vari­ ables other than those describing rainfall (e.g. tem­ perature) may have correlations with disease vari­ ables as high as or higher than the rain variables. 
Considering the complicated effects of rain intensity summarized above, it is not surprising that it is diffi­ cult to predict disease increase based primarily on rainfall. Variations in the crop canopy (Shaw & 
Royle 1993) and soil surface conditions (roughness, canopy) (Madden et al. 1993, Stedman 1980) can considerably affect the outcome of splash dispersal. 
Because of the short flight distances of splash droplets, dispersal or disease gradients typically are steep in the field. (Fig. 5). For strawberry anthrac nose, for instance, incidence generally declines to almost 0 at 2 m from the inoculum source. Most gra­ dients are described by the exponential model (Fitt et al. 1989). However, Pedersen and Morrall (1994) showed that a power model (Campbell & Madden 1990) better fitted dispersal gradient data for asochyta blight of lentil. In fact, they found steep, but longer-distance gradients, than typically exhibited for rain-splashed pathogens. It is possible that small

A generalized linear model analysis indicated that plant density had a significant but nonlinear effect (P<0.01) on disease incidence. wind-borne droplets and aerosols with spores play a bigger role in dissemination of A. fabae than other pathogens (Pedersen et al. 1994). 
Dispersal results for surface topography found with our rain simulator (Yang et al. 1990a) were vali­ dated in the field (Madden et al. 1993). Highest dis­ ease incidence was found with plastic ground cover and lowest (virtually 0) with straw. Disease incidence with soil was intermediate between plastic and straw. 
Plant density also affected dispersal in the field, and there was a nonlinear change in disease incidence (y) with plant density (Madden and Boudreau unpub­ lished; Table 2), in agreement with the rain simulator (Boudreau & Madden 1995). Although y generally decreased with increasing density, the highest y was associated with an intermediate plant density (Table 2). Distance at which v declined to 0.10 (jt10), an inverse measure of gradient steepness, generally decreased with increasing crop density. For instance, in 1992, x[0 was about 2 m with the lowest density and 1.6 m with the highest density. 
A stronger indication of plant density effects is the higher mean disease incidence on the near side (clos­ est to inoculum) than on the far side of plant rows at the same distance class from the inoculum source (example in Fig. 5). Conclusions 
A fuller understanding is emerging of the effects of rain splash on the dispersal of fungal spores. Based on detailed investigations using single-drop impactions and rain simulators, quantitative informa­ tion is now available on the splash process, spore entrainment in droplets, and droplet transport across surfaces and through canopies. 
Considerable research still is needed to translate controlled-study research into field applications. For instance, it is not yet known how to formally link spore dispersal to properties of rainfall (e.g. intensity) integrated over the duration of rain episodes.

Likewise, the interaction of rain variables and pathogen, crop, and physical factors needs consider­ ably more investigation.
