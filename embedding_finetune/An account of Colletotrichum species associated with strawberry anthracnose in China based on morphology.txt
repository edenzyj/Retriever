Strawberry anthracnose is an important disease in China that results in significant economic losses. A number of Colletotrichum species are known to be pathogens of strawberry. A survey of strawberry fields in eight provinces of China was carried out to identify the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. The disease mainly causes crown rot, leading to plant wilt and death in the nursery stage, after transplanting in green house, which makes anthracnose a major threat to strawberry production and quality. Multi-locus sequence analysis coupled with morphological assessment revealed that the disease-associated taxa belong to two Colletotrichum species complexes: Colletotrichum nymphaeae (acutatum species complex), C. fructicola and C. changpingense sp. nov. (gloeosporioides species complex). The novel species is introduced in this paper and illustrated. The new species is closely related to C. theobromicola and pathogenicity tests proved that it is pathogenic to the strawberry crown, fruits and leaves.   
Keywords – C. nymphaeae – crown rot – molecular phylogeny – morphology – pathogen  Introduction 
Strawberry (Fragaria× ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). 
Strawberry production has expanded rapidly in recent years and China has become one of the world’s largest strawberry producers and exporters. Strawberry cultivation occupies 100.5 × 10 3 ha with a yield of 2.8 million tonnes in 2013 (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of 
China 2014). With the increase of production, many fungal diseases have become a major problem in strawberry production, reducing fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). One of the most important diseases of strawberry is anthracnose, which is caused by species of Colletotrichum.

Colletotrichum is one of the most important plant pathogenic genera worldwide (Cannon et al. 2012, Hyde et al. 2014, Nilsson et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015), occurring predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions on a wide range of crops (Waller 1993, Hyde et al. 2009 a, b, 2014). A summary of names (Hyde et al. 2009a) and a review of the confusion with names in the genus (Hyde et al. 2009b), helped to kick start a series of studies that used molecular phylogeny and morphology, that have helped to define species in the genus (Cannon et al. 2012). Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is a major disease affecting strawberry production across the world (Mass 1998). Colletotrichum species infect all plant parts causing serious crown rot, irregular leaf spots, necrotic lesions on the petioles and runners, as well as black spot on the fruits (Mass 1998). Anthracnose can cause up to 80% of plant death in nurseries and over 50% of yield losses in strawberry fields (Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas 2005). For successful implementation of any resistance breeding and disease management programme, accurate pathogen identification is important (Freeman et al. 1998).  
Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China as late as 1990 (Hu 1990). Shao (1992) reported strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai for the first time and identified the pathogen as C. acutatum (Dai et al. 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) contributed to these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn C. theobromicola) as the causal agents based on morphological characters. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose of strawberry in China. Crown rot is the most severe disease problem in most strawberry producing areas in China (Ren et al. 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% of yield losses in strawberry fields has been recorded (Xie et al. 2010). The yield of greenhouse cultivated strawberries was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot in Donggang city in Laoning Province in 2009 (Wang 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in green houses of Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al. 2012). However, the majority of studies conducted in China regarding this disease were mainly based on morphology and single gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al. 2006, Ren et al. 2008, 2011). Due to the overlapping characters, species delimitation based on morphology alone is difficult in this genus. Use of multi-gene analysis combined with morphology can provide a better resolution (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014). Therefore the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.  Materials and Methods  
Sample collection, Isolation and Identification of fungi 
Disease samples showing anthracnose symptoms were collected from different locations (Anhui, Hainan, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong Provinces and Beijing, Shanghai cities) in 
China during 2011–2014. To promote fungal development and facilitate isolation, samples were incubated in a clean polythene bag with sterilized tissue dipped in distilled water. Samples were surface sterilized in 3.5% Sodium hypochlorite for 1–2 minutes and then rinsed three times in sterilized water before culturing on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium at 28 °C. Single germinating conidia were transferred to fresh PDA medium and incubated at 28 °C to obtain pure colonies of the fungi (Chomnunti et al. 2014). The pure isolates were maintained on PDA medium with sterilized filter paper and incubated for 7–10 days at 28 °C. Cultures on the filter papers were dried and stored at -20 °C for further study. Fungal mycelia and spores were observed and photographed using a ZEISS Imager M1 microscope and measurements were made on 40 conidia. 
All microscopic measurements were made with the Axio vision v 4.8 and images used for figures were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended version 10.0 software (Adobe Systems, The 
United States). Facesoffungi and Index Fungorum numbers are provided (Jayasiri et al. 2015, Index Fungorum 2016).   1149 
DNA extraction, PCR amplification and DNA sequencing 
Total genomic DNA was extracted by the modified protocol of Damm et al. (2008). Total genomic DNA was extracted from fresh mycelium (500 mg), scraped from the margin of a colony on a PDA plate incubated at 28 °C for 7–10 days. The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), partial sequences of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), actin (ACT) and β tubulin genes were amplified using primer pairs ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), GDF/GDR (Templeton et al. 1992), CHS79F/CHS345R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), ACT512F/ACT783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999) and BT1/BT2 (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997) respectively. PCR was performed in a BIORAD 1000 Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 25 l. PCR mixtures contained 
TaKaRa Ex-Taq DNA polymerase 0.3 l, 12.5 l of 2 × PCR buffer with 2.5 l of dNTPs, 1l of each primer, 9.2 l of double-distilled water and 100–500 ng of DNA template. The thermal cycling program followed that reported in Weir et al. (2012). The PCR products were visualised by staining with Ethidium bromide on 1.2% agarose electrophoresis gels and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions of a Qiagen purification kit (Qiagen, USA). DNA sequencing of the genes was conducted by Sunbiotech Company Ltd., Beijing, China. The sequence data from this study are placed in GenBank.  Phylogenetic Analysis 
Consensus sequences from the sequences generated from forward and reverse primers were obtained using DNAStar v.5.1 and SeqMan v.5.00 (Burland 2000). A combined dataset of the five gene regions was prepared using Clustal X1.81 (Thompson et al. 1997). Further alignment of sequences was achieved using default settings in MAFFT v.7 (Katoh & Toh 2008, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/) and manual adjustment was conducted using 
BioEditv.7.0.9.0 (Hall 1999) where necessary. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed for the acutatum species complex and for the gloeosporioides species complex. Maximum 
Parsimony analysis (MP) was performed using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002) to obtain the most parsimonious trees. Gaps were treated as missing data and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were set up to 5,000, branches of zero length were collapsed and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics for parsimony (Tree Length [TL], Consistency Index [CI], Retention Index [RI], 
Rescaled Consistency index [RC], and Homoplasy index [HI]) were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. The robustness of the most parsimonious trees was evaluated by 1000 bootstrap replications resulting from maximum parsimony analysis (Hillis & Bull 1993). 
Kishino-Hasegawa tests (KHT) (Kishino & Hasegawa 1989) were performed in order to determine whether trees were significantly different.  
Bayesian inference (BI) was used in addition to construct the phylogenies using Mr. Bayes v.3.1.2 (Ronquist et al. 2003). MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) was used to carry out statistical selection of best-fit model of nucleotide substitution. HYK+I model was selected for ITS, a 
HKY+G model for GAPDH and β-tubulin, a K80+I+G model for CHS-1, a GTR+G model for 
ACT were incorporated into the analysis. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1000000 generations and trees were sampled every 100 th  generation. The 2000 trees representing the burn-in phase of the analyses were discarded and the remaining 8000 trees used for calculating posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree. The alignments and trees are deposited in 
TreeBASE (Sanderson et al. 1994) under accession numbers S20238 respectively. The fungal strains used for the phylogenetic analysis in this study are listed in Table 1.  
Genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) analysis 
New species and their most closely related species were analysed using the GCPSR model. 
A pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) (Philippe & Bryant 2006) test was performed in SplitsTree4 (Huson 1998, Huson & Bryant 2006) as described by Quaedvlieg et al. (2014), in order to determine the recombination level within phylogenetically closely related species using a five-locus 1150 concatenated dataset for C. changpingense and its related species. If the pairwise homoplasy index is below a 0.05 threshold (Фw < 0.05), it indicated that there is a significant recombination present in the dataset. The relationships between closely related species were visualised by constructing a split graph, using both the LogDet transformation and splits decomposition options (Fig. 6).  Pathogenicity test 
In order to test the pathogenicity of the new species, detached fruits and leaves inoculations were conducted. To determine whether this new species can infect the rhizome (crown), seedling inoculations were carried out.  
Detached fruits and leaves inoculation 
Healthy strawberry fruits, leaves and seedlings were used for the pathogenicity test. Fruits and leaves were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol and washed three times with distilled water.  
Fifteen leaves and 15 fruits per isolate were wounded by means of sterilized insect needle, while 15 leaves and 15 fruits remained non-wounded. Conidial suspension (10 5 /mL, emended by a haemocytometer) was applied on the wounded and non-wounded fruits and uniformly sprayed onto the leaves. Control fruits and leaves were inoculated with sterilized water. The inoculated fruits and leaves with the controls were put into a plastic box covered with plastic film and incubated at 25 °C.   Seedling/ Rhizome inoculation 
In order to check the pathogenicity towards the strawberry rhizome, 30 strawberry seedlings planted in plastic pots were inoculated with spore suspension. Each seedling was planted in one pot and a 100mL spore suspension was added. The control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized water. The inoculated seedlings and the controls were kept in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a 12 h day/ night.  Results  Isolation of fungi 
Colletotrichum species were isolated from strawberry fruits, petioles, rhizomes and stolons showing typical anthracnose symptoms (Fig. 1). One hundred and twenty-one isolates were obtained from the disease samples and are deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture 
Collection (CGMCC) / Mae Fah Luang University Culture Collection, Thailand (MFLUCC) and the China Agricultural University Beijing (SA), China.   Phylogenetic analysis 
Twenty-one representative strains were used in the analysis. Phylogenies were reconstructed using combined ACT, GAPDH, CHS, ITS and β-tubulin sequence data for our isolates of Colletotrichum with those in recent publications on Colletotrichum (Damm et al. 2012, 
Weir et al. 2012, Sharma et al. 2013, Yan et al. 2015, Diao et al. 2017). A single phylogenetic tree was constructed for all Colletotrichum strains including our sequence data using five combined gene alignments. The tree was compared with the backbone tree in Hyde et al. (2014) and species narrowed down to the acutatum and gloeosporioides species complexes. Two separate phylogenetic trees were therefore constructed for the complexes. Maximum- parsimony and Bayesian inference produced nearly identical topologies (Bayesian trees are not shown). 
The combined gene alignment for the acutatum complex comprised 37 taxa and 1712 characters including gaps with C. orchidophilum (CBS 632.80) as the outgroup taxon. Parsimony analysis indicated that 1249 characters were constant, 229 variable characters uninformative and 234 characters parsimony-informative. The parsimony analysis of the data matrix yielded a single most parsimonious tree (TL = 689, CI = 0.729, RI = 0.820, RC = 0.597, HI = 0.271) which is presented in Fig 2. Five isolates (SA0017, SA0024, SA0041, SA0069 and SA0070) clustered together with C. nymphaeae with strong support.  1151

The combined gene alignment for the gloeosporioides complex comprised 52 taxa and 1932 characters including gaps with C. boninense (CBS 123755) as the outgroup taxon. Parsimony analysis indicated that 1350 characters were constant, 318 variable characters parsimony uninformative and 264 characters parsimony-informative. Parsimony analysis resulted in 100 most parsimonious trees, one of them (TL = 1040, CI = 0.696, RI = 0.779, RC = 0.542, HI = 0.304) is shown in Fig. 3 where 15 isolates obtained in this study clustered together with C. fructicola (CBS 130416) with a high support, while isolates SA0016 and SA0050 are sister to the clade that contains C. grevilleae, C. grossum and C. theobromicola also with high support (100/1.00).  Pathogenicity studies  
Detached fruits and leaves inoculation 
All of the inoculated leaves and fruits showed symptoms after 72 h inoculation. Symptoms on the wounded leaves and fruits appeared 24 h earlier than the non-wounded tissues. Orange spore masses appeared on the lesion under high humidity condition.  Seedling inoculation 
The inoculated strawberry seedlings began wilting after 10 d inoculation. The wilting seedlings were stunt compared with control plants. Necrosis was observed in the roots of the wilted plants. The longitudinal section of the crown showed red brown, hard lesions in rot. Twenty-four inoculated seedlings (80%) died after 20 d inoculation. Control seedlings remained healthy. 1152

Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde  Colletotrichum fructicola was originally reported from coffee berries in Thailand (Prihastuti et al. 2009) and has a wide host range (Weir et al. 2012). Colletotrichum fructicola belongs to the gloeosporioides species complex and has been reported from Canada and the USA causing strawberry anthracnose (Weir et al. 2012). Fifteen strains of this species were isolated from strawberry in this study; one strain from a fruit, two strains from petioles, 11 strains from rhizomes and one strain from a stolon. In the phylogram, our strains clustered with C. fructicola (ICMP 18581) with 99% bootstrap support and posterior probability values of 1.00 (Fig. 3).  
Colletotrichum nymphaeae (Pass.) Aa.  A detailed description of C. nymphaeae was provided by Damm et al. (2012). This species has a wide host range and belongs to the acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum nymphaeae has been recorded from Bulgaria, Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Kenya, Netherlands, South Africa, 
Spain, Switzerland, the UK and the USA (Damm et al. 2012), where it causes strawberry anthracnose. Five strains of this species were isolated from strawberry; two from fruits, two from petioles and one from a stolon. In the phylogram, our strains clustered with C. nymphaeae (CBS515.78) with 100% bootstrap support and posterior probability values of 1.00 (Fig. 2). 1155

Notes – Based on multi-locus sequence data (ACT, CHS, GAPDH, ITS and β-tubulin), C. changpingense is phylogenetically closely related to C. grevilleae, C. grossum and C. theobromicola. Sequence data derived from the ITS region does not separate C. changpingense from C. grevilleae, C. theobromicola and C. grossum. The BLASTn search with the ITS sequence of this strain showed 100% similarity to JX573319 C. gloeosporioides isolate. The closest match in a BLASTn search in GenBank with the GAPDH sequence was JX009957 C. theobromicola strain with 99% similarity. The closest matches in a BLASTn search in GenBank with the CHS sequence was KF772060 C. siamense strain with 97% similarity, with the ACT sequence was KT936435 C. siamense strain with 99% similarity. The BLASTn search with the β-tubulin is identical to C. grossum (CAUG7, KP890171) and C. theobromicola (C1273, JX010382). Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. grevilleae by 17bp changes in ACT, 11bp changes in CHS, 6bp changes in GAPDH and 8bp changes in ITS. Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. theobromicola by 17bp changes in ACT, 12bp changes in CHS, 2bp changes in GAPDH, 9bp changes in ITS and 8bp changes in β-tubulin. Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. grossum by 18bp changes in ACT, 9bp changes in 
CHS and 5bp changes in GAPDH. Therefore C. changpingense provides sufficient data to be accommodated as a new species. A PHI test revealed no significant recombination event between 
C. changpingense and its closely related taxa (Fig. 6).  
Fig. 6  – The results of the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test of closely related species using both LogDet transformation and splits decomposition. PHI test results (Φw) < 0.05 indicate significant recombination within the dataset.  
Discussion  Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single gene based identifications, which would have been identified to species complexes rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae) became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010), which led to the use of molecular methods (Cai et al. 2009) as they provide useful data in clarifying the systematics of Colletotrichum (Hyde et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015). Xie et al. (2010) identified the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of Strawberry cv. Toyonoka in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China to be C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola using morphology and ITS gene region alone. 
As ITS gene alone does not resolve Colletotrichum species well (Martinez-Culebras 2002, Jelev et al. 2008, Xie et al. 2010), multigene analysis has been adopted to resolve Colletotrichum species satisfactorily (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014), and the present study has followed this protocol.

SA Culture collection of China Agriculture University, Beijing, China; N.S. not sequenced    The main taxa reported to cause strawberry anthracnose worldwide are C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Mass 1998), the latter which has been synonimized under C. theobromicola (Weir et al. 2012). Besides C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola, 
C. coccodes (Buddie et al. 1999; Cannon et al. 2012), C. cuscutae (Damm et al. 2012), C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), C. fioriniae (MacKenzie et al. 2009; Damm et al. 2012), C.godetiae (Damm et al. 2012), C. nymphaeae (Damm et al. 2012), C. salicis (Damm et al. 2012) and C. simmondsii (Whitelaw-Weckertet al. 2007, Damm et al. 2012) have been reported to be associated with strawberry anthracnose; most of these taxa belong to C. acutatum species complex. 
In this study, we have determined the species of Colletotrichum that are associated with strawberry anthracnose in eight strawberry growing provinces of China. A new Colletotrichum species that causes strawberry anthracnose in China is described as C. changpingense, based on morphological features, multi-gene phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity assays. The five gene multi-loci analysis revealed that this isolate from rhizomes, clustered separately from other 
Colletotrichum species. Pathogenicity testing showed that the newly introduced species is pathogenic not only on the strawberry crowns, but also on fruits and leaves. This species is capable of causing crown rot disease which is characterized by reddish brown rhizomes with less roots and wilted leaves. Anthracnose lesions on ripe strawberry fruits are firm, slightly sunken and covered with pink masses. This species is also capable of causing leaf spots on strawberry characterized by brown to black necrotic spots along the veins and inter-vein regions. Fifteen strains of C. fructicola were recorded from a fruit, petioles, rhizomes and a stolon and five strains of C. nymphaeae were also recorded from fruits, petioles and a stolon. As the latter two species are well-known pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose in different countries (Damm et al. 2012, Weir et al. 2012), this paper further contributes that these two species are also associated with strawberry anthracnose in 
China. In this study we did not find C. theobromicola. However, there were 15 more isolates in the single phylogenetic tree which consisted of all the Colletotrichum species that were not well resolved. Further clarifications of those isolates are needed. This study contributes in updating the 
Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry of China. Species with similar morphology may have a considerable physiological and pathogenic variation. It is important to know the host distribution of a particular Colletotrichum species which will be important in implementing bio security measures in quarantine (Jayawardena et al. 2016).
