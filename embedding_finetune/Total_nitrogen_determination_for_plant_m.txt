A nonfoaming method for semimicro Kjeldahl determination of total nitrogen in plant samples containing appreciable amounts of nitrate was developed for use with a digestion block utilizing test tubes for digestion flasks. The sample (30 to 200 mg) is treated with 5 ml of a sulfuric acid:salicylic acid (3O:l v/w) mixture at room temperature for 1 hr. Catalyst [K,SO,:CuSeO,.ZH,O:pumice 970:19:11 w/w/w)] is added and the mixture is digested at 360 to 380°C for 1 hr after the mixture clears. Ammonium in the digest is determined by a suitable method. This semimicro Kjeldahl procedure results in a 95% or better recovery of nitrate, either from KN03 or from KN03 added to plant material. 
In conducting experiments in which large numbers of samples are ana- lyzed for total nitrogen the standard equipment and procedure are costly, require a lot of laboratory space, and are labor intensive (1). A 160- sample digestion apparatus utilizing test tubes (2) and an AutoAnalyzer method for ammonium determination (3) have been developed for use with samples containing little or no nitrate. 
This report describes a semimicro method which determines total nitro- gen in plant material containing appreciable amounts of nitrate utilizing a tube digestion apparatus (2) without excessive foaming. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Milled rice (var. Labelle), soybean seed (var. Davis), wheat grain (var. 
Milam), and leaf material from three-leaf corn (var. Texas 28A), two- leaf cotton (var. Stoneville 213), one-leaf cucumber (var. Ashley), three- leaf peanut (var. Starr), three-leaf rice, two-leaf sorghum (var. NK233), three-leaf soybean, three-leaf wheat, and potassium nitrate were analyzed. 
All plant samples were dried in an oven at 65°C and ground in a Wiley mill2 to pass a 30-mesh screen. Dried samples were stored in a desic- cator until analyzed. ’ Contribution from the Texas A&M University Agricultural Research and Extension

For plant material containing little or no nitrate a standard semimicro 
Kjeldahl method (2) (Method A) is used. For samples containing high nitrate concentrations the following modified method (Method B) is used. 
Place 30 to 200 mg (depending upon plant material) of dried, ground plant material in a 50-ml graduated Folin-Wu digestion tube. Add 5 ml of a sulfuric acid:salicylic acid (30: 1 v/w) mixture, cover, and allow to stand at room temperature for at least I hr. Add approximately 1 g of Se1 Dahl digestion mix (Scientific Products) [K,SO,:CuSeO,*2H,O:pumice (970: 19:ll w/w/w)]. Place the tubes on a digestion block (2) preheated to ap- proximately 200°C and digest at 380°C for 1 hr after the digest clears to ensure complete digestion. After cooling, bring the digest to 50 ml with deionized (nitrogen-free) water. Mix the contents of each tube and transfer approximately 3 ml to a sampling cup for storage in a refrigerator until analyzed for ammonium with the AutoAnalyzer (3). To determine if a pretreatment was necessary, samples were weighed and placed in the digestion tubes, the sulfuric acid:salicylic acid mixture was added, and four random tubes were taken at intervals for addition of catalyst and digestion. RESULTS AND DISCUSSION 
Method A is a method for determining total nitrogen in samples con- taining little or no nitrate nitrogen. However, recovery of nitrate nitrogen from KN03 is only 43.90 + 3.39%. Nelson and Sommers (4) reported a similar method recovered 16 to 55% of the added nitrate. Several meth- ods (1,4-7) have been developed for nitrate containing samples; how- ever, these methods either result in excessive foaming for digestion of a large number of samples in tubes or are too labor intensive for routine use with many samples. Nelson and Sommers (4) proposes a sulfuric TABLE 1

Na2S,0,*5Hz0 and gentle heating until foaming ceases. The tubes are allowed to cool, the catalyst is added, and the sample is digested. Addi- tion of the Na&0,*5H,O results in excessive foaming and loss of sample if extreme care is not exercised. 
Method B, which uses a sulfuric acid:salicylic acid mixture and catalyst (without Na,S,O,*5H,O treatment) was developed. This method elimi- nates foaming and quantitatively recovers nitrate nitrogen. A pretreatment with the sulfuric acid:salicylic acid mixture is necessary to obtain quanti- tative recovery of the nitrate nitrogen from KNO, (Table 1). Pretreat- ment time of 0.5 hr or longer results in at least 95% recovery of the nitrate nitrogen. For routine use we pretreat for at least 1 hr before adding the catalyst. 
Table 2 shows the recovery of nitrate nitrogen using Method B from 
KN03 and when KNO, is added to various plant materials. Recovery of nitrate nitrogen from KNO, was 99.89 k .63%. Recovery of added nitrate nitrogen from plant tissue ranged from 96.16 + 1.36% for peanut leaf material to 100.00 t 3.39% for cucumber leaf material. 
This method requires more time than the standard Kjeldahl method but quantitatively recovers nitrate nitrogen which the standard Kjeldahl method does not. Other methods which recover nitrate nitrogen are not suitable for tube digestion due to the extreme care required to prevent 594 E. F. EASTIN foaming and loss of sample. This method is relatively rapid, easy, and quantitatively recovers nitrate nitrogen from a variety of plant tissues. 
It should also recover nitrate from soil. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
