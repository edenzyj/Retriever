Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent among anthracnose pathogens of strawberry in Nara, Japan. We hypothe sized that a wide range of weeds growing in and around strawberry fields are inoculum sources of the disease and investigated their potential as hosts of C. fructicola. We also examined the influence of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on weeds. The fungus was detected on 31 of 541 (5.7%) leaves sampled from 13 weed species from 2005 to 2008. The fungus was most frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum with an isolation frequency of 17.9%; inoculation of A. blitum with the pathogen caused brown leaf spots. Other weeds such as Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Solidago altissima, Erigeron annuus, and Sonchus oleraceus were found to harbor the fungus at lower rates (4.3–8.1%) without symptoms. C. fructicola formed acervuli on leaves of A. blitum, D. ciliaris, and S. oleraceus after plants were killed by a herbicide (glyphosate). These results demonstrated that infected weeds associated with strawberry cultivation are potential inoculum sources of C. fructicola, especially after herbicide treatment.

Anthracnose is the most severe disease of strawberry (Fra garia × ananassa Duch.) (Freeman and Katan 1997; Nam et al. 2004; Peres et al. 2005; Van Hemelrijcka et al. 2010). 
The disease occurred extensively in the late 1970s in western 
Japan, including Nara, and it still remains a serious problem for strawberry growers (Hirayama et al. 2016; Okayama and 
Tsujimoto 1994). Most of the commonly grown strawberry cultivars are susceptible (Mori 1998), and the emergence of fungicide-resistant strains hinders disease control (Inada et al. 2010). The use of infected runner plantlets also con tributes to disease epidemics (Hirayama et al. 2010).
Colletotrichum fructicola Prihastuti, L.Cai and K.D.Hyde has recently been identified as one of the main causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in Nara and Chiba prefectures, 
Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Colletotrichum fructicola, as well as other strawberry anthracnose pathogens, occurs primarily in nurseries, and latently infects runner plantlets, resulting in transmission of the disease from the nursery to production fields (Debodea et al. 2015; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994). 
Thus, eradicating the pathogen from nurseries is essential to prevent disease incidence, has been accomplished using a practical system combined with detection assays for the pathogen (Hirayama et al. 2015; Suzuki et al. 2008) and elimination from infected plants (Hirayama et al. 2010). 
However, thorough eradication of the pathogen from nurs eries does not always lead to complete disease control.
Preliminary surveys in infested fields revealed that weeds were present in the vicinity of diseased strawberry plants (Hirayama et al. 2007). Colletotrichum spp. from strawberry are known to be pathogenic on cultivated and noncultivated plants including weeds (Howard and Albregts 1973; Mac
Kenzie et al. 2007; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994; Whit ing and Roncadori 1997; Xiao et al. 2004). Colletotrichum  * Yoshihiko Hirayama  hirayama-yoshihiko@office.pref.nara.lg.jp 1 Graduate School of Life and Environmental Sciences, Osaka

However, the latent infection of weeds by C. fructicola has never been studied in terms of the epidemiology of the disease. We also suspected that herbicide sprays predisposed weeds to the development of C. fructicola. In fact, acervuli of C. truncatum developed more rapidly on herbicide-treated plants than on untreated plants (Cerkauskas et al. 1983).
The purpose of this study was to examine weeds as a potential inoculum source of C. fructicola. We focused on (1) isolating the pathogen from several weed species in and around strawberry fields; (2) determining pathogenicity and infectivity of the pathogen on the weeds species; and (3) clarifying the growth of the pathogen on weeds treated with the herbicide glyphosate.Materials and methods 
Detection of the anthracnose fungus from weeds 
A total of 541 weeds leaves were collected from 12 straw berry nurseries in Nara from 2005 to 2008 (Table 1). Leaf samples were cleaned in running tap water for 3 min, sur face-sterilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol for a few seconds and in 2% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, and rinsed with sterilized distilled water. They were air-dried for 1 h, and then placed on modified Mathur’s medium, which contained 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.1% (w/v) bactopeptone, 1% (w/v) sucrose, 0.25% (w/v)  MgSO4·7H2O, 0.27% (w/v)  KH2PO4, 2% (w/v) agar, 2.5 mg a.i. of iprodione (Rovral 
WP, Bayer CropScience, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1% (v/v) lactic acid, and 25 mg ampicillin in 1 L of distilled water (Freeman et al. 2001). After incubation at 25 °C for 7 days in dark ness, Colletotrichum colonies were selected based on micro scopic characters. Single-spore cultures of Colletotrichum spp. were then started by a spore streaking onto water agar. 
We visited nurseries again to investigate disease occurrence in the next cultivation season.
Molecular identification of the causal fungus 
Colletotrichum isolates from weeds were cultured on potato dextrose ager (PDA, Difco, Detroit, USA) for 7 days to obtain mycelia, and DNA was extracted from each mycelial sample using the CTAB method (Freeman et al. 2001). Poly merase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific primers was conducted to identify the species of Colletotrichum. 
Primer pairs used were CgInt and universal ITS4 primer for the C. gloeosporioides complex (Mills et al. 1992) and primer CaInt2 and universal ITS4 primer for C. acutatum (Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996). PCR was performed using a GeneAmp 9700 thermocycler (Thermo Fisher Scientific, 
Yokohama, Japan) in a 20 μL reaction mixture, contain ing 10–100 ng of genomic DNA, 2 × GoTaq Master Mix (Promega, Tokyo, Japan) and 10 pmol of each primer. The amplification protocol consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 58 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 1 min; and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Amplification products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels to detect specific reactions under a UV light after staining with SYBR gold.
Isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex were further identified to the species level by PCR using primer pair 
Marker 2 (Gan et al. 2017). PCR and the detection of ampli cons were conducted as above except for the PCR condi tions, i.e., denaturation at 95 °C for 10 min; followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min, 55 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 30 s; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 min.
Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex isolates to strawberry 
Strawberry plants were inoculated with Colletotrichum iso lates from weeds identified as species of the C. gloeospori oides complex to confirm pathogenicity. Conidia formed on 7-day-old PDA cultures were suspended in sterile distilled water and adjusted to  106 conidia/mL. Ten microliters of the conidial suspension was dropped on intact leaflets of strawberry cv. Asukaruby. Sterile water was dropped on the leaflets as the control. Plants were then covered with plas tic bags to maintain 100% humidity and grown at 25 °C in ambient light. Isolates eliciting symptoms on more than two thirds of the inoculated leaflets were judged as pathogenic. 
The experiment was conducted using two leaflets on each of three plants for each isolate.
Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates on weeds 
The weeds inoculated for this test were Amaranthus blitum 
L., Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.) Koeler, Galinsoga ciliata Blake, 
Sonchus oleraceus L., and Portulaca oleracea L. The weed seedlings at the 3- to 5-leaf stage of growth were collected from a field where strawberry had not been previously culti vated and were transplanted to 300-mL plastic pots contain ing nursery soil (TM-1, Takii Seed, Kyoto, Japan). The col lected plants were confirmed to be C. fructicola-free using 
Mathur’s medium. Asukaruby strawberry plants with three leaves were used as a control. Colletotrichum fructicola iso lates Nara-gc5 (MAFF 245243) and 19002 (MAFF 306782) from strawberry were used. They were naturally resistant to benomyl (50 mg a.i./l, Benlate WP, Sumitomo Chemi cal, Osaka, Japan) on Mathur’s medium. The C. fructicola 14 Journal of General Plant Pathology (2018) 84:12–19 1 3 isolates were cultured in 200 mL Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 100 mL of potato sucrose broth (200 g sliced potato, 20 g sucrose and 1 L distilled water) on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm at 25 °C for 10 days. Cultures were then

Conidia were suspended in sterile water and adjusted to  106 conidia/ mL. Potted plants each received 10 mL of the conidial sus pension using a hand sprayer and were covered with plastic bags to keep moisture levels at 100% humidity. The sterile water was sprayed on the leaves as the control. Anthracnose symptoms on the plants were recorded and confirmed infec tion with the pathogen using Mathur’s medium 7 days after inoculation. The experiment was carried out in triplicate, with three plants per replicate.
Latent infection of weeds by Colletotrichum fructicola isolates 
Amaranthus blitum and D. ciliaris, the most prevalent weeds in and around strawberry fields, were collected for inocu lation experiments to check for latent infection by Colle totrichum fructicola. Weed seedlings were transplanted into pots as described above. Asukaruby strawberry plants at the 3-leaf stage were used as a control. The plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. fructicola isolate 
Nara-gc5 as described above, except that the conidial den sity was adjusted to  103 conidia/mL. Inoculated plants were placed in a greenhouse and watered twice a day using drip irrigation. Leaves were sampled 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after inoculation. Nine leaves from each plant species were ran domly sampled at each time. Leaves were surface-sterilized as described above, air-dried for 1 h, and divided into eight equal segments. These were placed on modified Mathur’s medium and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 7 days. Then, the percentage of latent infection was calculated using the number of leaf pieces with mycelial growth. The experiment was repeated three times using one plant per repetition.
Influence of glyphosate on conidial formation by Colletotrichum fructicola isolate on weeds 
The effect of herbicide was estimated from the capacity of conidial production of the fungus on glyphosate-treated plants. Benomyl-resistant isolate Nara-gc5 of Colletotri chum fructicola was used to inoculate plants of A. blitum, 
D. ciliaris, S. oleraceus and Asukaruby strawberry. Condi tions for growth and inoculation were the same as described previously. Each plant was sprayed with 1 mL of glyphosate potassium (5.0 g a.i./l, Roundup Maxload, Nissan Chemical 
Industries, Tokyo, Japan) 2 weeks after inoculation. Control plants were treated with water instead of herbicide. Leaves were then removed 7 days after treatment with the herbi cide and cut into 1-cm2 pieces. Five leaf pieces were vor texed in 10 mL of sterilized distilled water for 2 min. The suspension was spread on the plates containing modified 
Mathur’s medium with benomyl (50 mg a.i./l, Benlate WP, 
Sumitomo Chemical, Osaka, Japan) to restrict colony size, then incubated in the dark at 25 °C for 7 days. The number of C. fructicola conidia was estimated based on the number of colony forming units (CFUs). The pathogen was distin guished from any contaminating fungi by its benomyl resist ance on the modified Mathur’s medium. The experiment was repeated five times using five plates per treatment. Conidia that formed on the leaf were also confirmed as C. fructicola by microscopic observations.Results 
Detection of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates from weeds and their pathogenicity on strawberry 
Colletotrichum fructicola was detected from 31 of 541 (5.7%) leaves of 13 weed species from 2005 to 2008 (Table 1). Single-spore cultures of C. fructicola isolate were started from 31 individual leaves, and four representative isolates among them were deposited at the NARO Gene bank-Microorganisms Section as MAFF 246279 to 246282. 
The presence of the pathogen on weeds tended to lead to diseased strawberries during the next cultivation season (Table 1). Detection frequency of the C. gloeosporioides complex, including C. fructicola, was 15.9% (detected leaves/tested leaves) (Table 1). All the isolates proved to be a member of the C. gloeosporioides complex by PCR using species-specific primers. All C. fructicola isolates caused typical disease symptoms on strawberry plants, but control plants did not develop any symptoms. Isolates of 
C. gloeosporioides complex other than C. fructicola were not pathogenic on strawberry. Among weed species, A. blitum was most frequently infected (17.9%) by C. fructi cola (Table 2). The following weeds showed relatively low detection rate (4.3–8.1%) without symptoms:D. ciliaris, G. ciliata, S. altissima, E. annuus, and S. oleraceus (Table 2). 
Colletotrichum fructicola was not isolated from the remain ing seven species:Senecio vulgaris L., Cyperus microiria 
Steud., Lamium amplexicaule L., Portulaca oleracea L., 
Alopecurus aequalis Sobol., Capsella bursa-pastoris Medi cus, and Cerastium glomeratum Thuill. Colletotrichum fruc ticola tended to be isolated from warm-season weeds more frequently than cool-season weeds (Table 2).
Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates on weeds 
Plants were inspected for anthracnose symptoms 7 days after inoculation. Brown leaf spots on A. blitum caused by inoculation with C. fructicola (Fig. 1, Table 3) differed from the typical symptoms caused on strawberry plants. 
The pathogen was reisolated from leaves with brown leaf spots. No symptoms developed on other weed species, 16 Journal of General Plant Pathology (2018) 84:12–19 1 3 including D. ciliaris, G. ciliata, S. oleraceus, and P. olera cea. No symptoms developed on negative control plants sprayed with sterile water.
Latent infection of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates on weeds 
Amaranthus blitum and strawberry retained a high level of infection, ranging between 80 and 100% throughout the experiment; however, the infection rate of D. ciliaris decreased with time to ca. 20% within 8 weeks (Fig. 2). 
Although strawberry had slightly black leaf spots, neither weed showed any symptoms.
Influence of glyphosate treatment on conidial formation of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates on weeds 
All plants were dead by 7 days after glyphosate treatment. 
The number of C. fructicola conidia was significantly higher on glyphosate-treated leaves than on untreated leaves in all the plants tested (Fig. 3). Acervuli formation was observed microscopically on glyphosate-treated leaves in all plants 7 days after the treatment (Fig. 4).Discussion 
Anthracnose caused by C. fructicola is one of the most destructive diseases of strawberry in Nara, Japan. The dis ease has often been observed on strawberry plants adjacent to weeds. The present study demonstrated that at least six of 13 species of weeds were infected by C. fructicola. Of the six weeds, five were warm-season weeds. Amaranthus bli tum, which is one of the most common warm-season weeds in Nara, was most frequently infected by C. fructicola and often developed leaf spots. Five other weeds were less fre quently infected and without visible symptoms. Colletotri chum fructicola is active under warm conditions; therefore, warm-season weeds may have a high potential for patho gen activity. Among the warm-season weeds, A. blitum was regarded as most likely to harbor the inoculum of C. fructi cola in Nara Prefecture. 
Inoculation tests of weeds with C. fructicola suggested that the pathogen can survive latently on most weeds. Colle totrichum acutatum, another strawberry anthracnose patho gen, invades the intercellular space of infected tissues of pepper plants without any visible damage (Horowitz et al. 2002). The fungus forms secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves, increasing the number of conidia three fold (Leandro et al. 2001). Colletotrichum fructicola may similarly produce more conidia during latent infection in weeds. The pathogen would increase in the strawberry fields without being noticeable because latently infected weeds are difficult to detect by eye. Strawberry growers have never

Fig. 1  Leaf spots of Amaranthus blitum after inoculation with Colle totrichum fructicola isolate Nara-gc5 17Journal of General Plant Pathology (2018) 84:12–19 1 3 recognized nonsymptomatic weeds as significant inocu lum sources. These latently infected weeds should thus be emphasized as important inoculum sources of C. fructicola.
The present results showed that weeds infected by Colle totrichum fructicola fall into three groups based on their susceptibility. The first group, including A. blitum, is always susceptible to the pathogen. The second group, including D. ciliaris, rapidly decreases in susceptibility to C. fructicola infection and does not develop symptoms. The third group, including Cyperus microiria, is resistant or immune to C. fructicola and do not appear to be sources of C. fructicola inoculum. Members of the second group can act as C. fruc ticola inoculum sources under herbicide-treated conditions because they produce abundant conidia after being killed by the herbicide, although susceptibility varies among the weed species.
The conidia of strawberry anthracnose pathogens are known to be water-borne via rain and/or overhead irriga tion (Ntahimpera et al. 1999). Okayama (1994) reported that the conidia dispersed more than 3 m when it rained heav ily, then disease developed on leaflets and petioles. There fore, conidia that formed abundantly on herbicide-treated weeds are also likely to be dispersed to strawberry plants, Table 3  Pathogenicity of

Fig. 4  Acervulus of Colletotrichum fructicola formed on leaf of Ama ranthus blitum 7 days after treatment with glyphosate. The acervulus was stained with aniline blue (bar 50 μm) 18 Journal of General Plant Pathology (2018) 84:12–19 1 3 resulting in epidemics of strawberry anthracnose throughout the nursery. In the traditional system of strawberry produc tion, plants are grown in the ground, and crop rotation is essential. In recent cultivation systems, however, the plants are cultivated continuously on elevated benches to improve production efficacy. This continuous cropping system usu ally increases weed populations and requires intensive herbi cide application, which can also enhance the risk of disease dissemination from weeds to strawberry. The present study showed that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds enhanced the incidence of anthracnose in strawberry during the next cultivation season. Although there are many sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, pathogen increases on herbicide-treated weeds can be an important source.
In conclusion, this study highlighted the potential importance of weeds as an inoculum source of C. fructi cola and clarified the risk of herbicide treatment on weeds and inoculum production. The elimination of the pathogen from infected mother plants (Debodea et al. 2015) and the removal of plant residues are critical to control strawberry anthracnose (Freeman et al. 2002; Ureña-Padilla et al. 2001). 
This study demonstrated that weed control by appropriate procedures is also important to minimize the primary infec tion of strawberry plants by C. fructicola. This new infor mation should help farmers determine the best cultivation methods to manage strawberry anthracnose.
