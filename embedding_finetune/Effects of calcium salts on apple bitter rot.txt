Bitter rot, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (teleomorph = Glomerella cingulata) and C. acutatum, is a destruc tive fruit rot of apple and pear in the south ern, central, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and in most countries where these fruits are grown (13). Prior to the development of effective fungicides, disease of apples could be extensive, with entire crops lost following periods of warm, wet weather. With the advent of modern fungicides, the disease is less prevalent than in the past, largely due to the efficacy of the ethylene-bis dithiocar bamates (EBDCs). However, with the greater restrictions on these fungicides since their reregistration in 1994, signifi cant fruit losses from bitter rot have oc curred in years when weather conditions have been favorable and less effective fungicides were used. Although disease control is achieved primarily with the use of fungicides, orchard sanitation is an inte gral part of disease management.
Application of supplemental calcium to apples is a routine practice in orchards that are prone to calcium-related nutritional disorders such as cork spot and bitter pit.
The most common form of calcium sup plement is calcium chloride (as a 75% food-grade flake); however, many pro prietary products containing calcium in other forms, or combined with other nutri ents, are available. Calcium supplements are most often applied beginning 2 to 4 weeks after petal fall and may continue through the preharvest period for as many as eight applications. Recommended rates of calcium chloride range from 17 to 56 kg/ha per year based on the potential se verity of nutritional disorders.
In addition to controlling nutritional dis orders, increasing the calcium content of fruits and vegetables increases their storage life. This effect is thought to be due mainly to the role of calcium in ameliorating physiological disorders and thus indirectly reducing pathogen activity (1,11). Much of the research with apples on enhancing storage quality and reducing decay with calcium supplementation has been done in the postharvest environment (6–10). Few studies have examined the potential role of calcium supplementation in the preharvest period for reducing disease. These trials were conducted to determine whether the use of Ca salts had any effect on fungal growth and disease incidence in vitro or in vivo.MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungal isolates. Fungal isolates were obtained from K. S. Yoder (Virginia Tech,
Winchester Agricultural Research and
Extension Center) and were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in petri dishes.
Isolates were subcultured weekly and maintained at 22°C during the periods in which experiments were conducted. Con idia for inoculum were harvested from 7 day-old cultures in all the studies described below. Longer term storage of cultures was on PDA in culture tubes maintained at 4°C.
Conidia were harvested by flooding the dishes with sterile distilled water, scraping the plates with a rubber spatula, and filter ing the suspension through four layers of sterile cheesecloth. The desired concentra tions of conidia were prepared by dilution from the original suspensions after count ing with a hemacytometer.
Effects of calcium salts on spore ger mination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth in vitro. Pure calcium salts used in this study were calcium chlo ride, calcium propionate, and calcium sili cate. These salts were selected based on the results of a preliminary study in which a broad range of calcium salts was tested for in vitro activity on growth of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. To as sess the effects of calcium salts on germi nation of conidia, salts were prepared in sterile deionized distilled water and were added to autoclaved warm (45 to 55°C) 2% water agar (WA) to provide a final con centration of 1,000 mg of calcium per liter.
The medium was poured into 9-cm-di ameter petri dishes. WA medium not sup plemented with calcium was included as a control. Five 30-µl droplets of freshly pre pared conidia suspension of either fungus were placed on each of three replicate dishes. To assess germination, 50 conidia were examined from each droplet after 8 h at 22°C. A conidium was considered ger minated if the length of the germ tube was more than half the length of the conidium.
This experiment was conducted twice. To assess the effects of calcium salts on germ tube elongation, the procedure described above was used, except that 25 germ tubes from each droplet were measured with an ocular micrometer after 14 h at 22°C. This experiment was conducted twice. Data were analyzed with analysis of variance, ABSTRACT
Biggs, A. R. 1999. Effects of calcium salts on apple bitter rot caused by two Colletotrichum spp.Plant Dis. 83:1001-1005.
The effects of three calcium salts on conidial germination, germ tube elongation, growth in vitro, and infectivity in the laboratory and field were studied for the apple bitter rot pathogens,
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. Calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate at 1,000 µg of calcium per ml had no effect on conidial germination; however, calcium chloride and calcium propionate inhibited germ tube growth by 41 and 50% relative to the control, respectively. All three calcium salts reduced fungal dry weight in liquid culture media. When calcium salt solutions were applied to wounded apples prior to inoculation, fruit treated with calcium chloride and calcium propionate exhibited 30% smaller lesions than those treated with calcium silicate or the control, which were similar. Fruit treated with calcium chlo ride and calcium propionate exhibited delayed formation of acervuli relative to the control and calcium silicate, which were similar. When fruit were inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia, from 1 × 103 to 1 × 105 conidia per ml, fruit treated with calcium chloride exhibited reduced incidence of infection after inoculations with 1 × 103 conidia per ml. In all tests at 1 × 104 and 1 × 105 conidia per ml, the control and calcium salt treatments resulted in similar inci dences of infection after inoculations. In six field trials, where fruit received three weekly dilute applications of calcium solutions, fruit treated with calcium salts and then inoculated with con idia of either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum exhibited lower incidences of infection when compared with control fruit. These experiments demonstrate that calcium salts have suppressive activity against the bitter rot pathogens and could be used as part of a disease management pro gram.

Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS Institute, Cary,NC). 
To assess the effects of calcium salts on mycelial growth, salts were prepared in sterile deionized distilled water and were added to autoclaved warm (45 to 55°C) 2% potato dextrose broth (PDB) to provide a range of concentrations from 600 to 1,200 mg of calcium per liter. The media were poured into 250-ml stationary flasks. A 30 µl drop of a suspension of 1 × 105 conidia from either fungus was placed in each flask. Flasks were incubated in the dark at 20 ± 2°C, and growth was assessed after 14 days by determining the dry weight of the mycelium. The experiment was per formed three times with three replicate flasks per treatment, and results were sub jected to regression analysis (SAS).
Effects of calcium salts on infection of wounded apple fruit and rate of forma tion of acervuli. In 1996, harvested fruit of apple cultivar Nittany were placed on paper trays in plastic tubs. Each fruit was surface-disinfested with 70% ethanol and then wounded by piercing the epidermis with a sharpened 7-mm-diameter cork borer and removing the disk of epidermis with a sterile scalpel. Solutions of calcium chloride, calcium propionate, calcium sili cate (each at 1,000 mg of calcium per li ter), or sterile deionized water were sprayed on the fruit until the surfaces were saturated. Sprayed fruit were then allowed to air-dry, after which 30 µl of a suspension of 1 × 105 conidia from either fungus was placed in each wound. Lids were placed on the tubs to help maintain a high relative humidity, and the diameter of the resulting lesions was measured 7 and 14 days after inoculation. Each lesion was measured twice at right angles, and the two values were averaged to obtain the lesion diame ter. Periodic observations were made on the development of acervuli on the surfaces of lesions. Acervulus development was rated on a 0 to 3 scale, with 0 = no acervuli initials, 1 = black acervuli initials visible, 2 = pigmented acervuli present but not vis cid, and 3 = pigmented acervuli with a viscid appearance. Each treatment for each fungus consisted of three replicates of 10 fruit each. This experiment was conducted three times. Data on lesion diameter were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated with the Waller
Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS). Differences among categorical rankings for acervulus development were determined with theKruskal-Wallis test (SAS).
In a second set of experiments, fruit were prepared as above and then were inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia ranging from 1 × 103 to 1 × 105 conidia per ml. This experiment was con ducted four times. The first trial of this experiment was conducted in 1996 with the cultivar Nittany, and the remaining trials were conducted in 1997 with the cultivar Golden Delicious. Data on disease incidence and lesion diameter were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated with the WallerDuncan k-ratio t test (SAS).
Effects of field applications of calcium salts to apple fruit on the incidence and severity of bitter rot. In 1997 (Golden
Delicious) and 1998 (Nittany), fruit on trees that had not been sprayed with fungi cides were sprayed with calcium chloride, calcium propionate, or calcium silicate (1997 only) or calcium hydroxide (1998 only) at 1,200 mg of calcium per liter.
Each set of 10 fruit per treatment was sprayed to runoff with 1,200 mg of calcium per liter + 0.1% Nufilm 17 (Miller Chemi cal Co., Biglerville, PA) weekly for 3 con secutive weeks. Preliminary tests with
Nufilm 17 were conducted to determine that the adjuvant had no effect on fruit infection by Colletotrichum spp. The day following the third calcium application, attached fruit were inoculated with either
C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum. Inocu lations were made by preparing suspen sions of conidia as described above, im mersing 2.5-cm-wide cheesecloth strips (4 layers thick) into the suspensions, and wrapping the strips around the widest part of the fruit. The strips were secured with one layer each of plastic wrap and alumi num foil. The inoculum was removed after 5 to 7 days. Controls included fruit sprayed with distilled water and inoculated, and nonsprayed fruit that were inoculated without conidia. The experiment was con ducted three times in each of the two years.
All fruit from the three trials in each year were harvested at the normal harvest date for the particular cultivar. The harvested fruit were arranged in labeled trays and were observed weekly for disease inci dence (presence of bitter rot determined from visible sporulation or reisolation when necessary). Data on disease inci dence were subjected to analysis of vari ance, and means were separated with the
Waller-Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS). The effect of the trial was determined to be not significant (Bartlett’s test), so data from the separate trials were combined.RESULTS
Effects of calcium salts on conidial germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth in vitro. At 1,000 mg of calcium per liter, calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate had no effect on conidial germination in vitro.
Calcium chloride inhibited germ tube growth of C. gloeosporioides by 41% and of C. acutatum by 50% relative to the con trol, and calcium propionate inhibited germ tube growth of C. gloeosporioides by 48% and of C. acutatum by 80% (Table 1). In liquid culture media, calcium chloride and

Effects of calcium salts on infection of wounded apple fruit and rate of forma tion of acervuli. Wounds that were treated with calcium chloride and then inoculated exhibited 20 to 29% smaller lesions than the control for C. acutatum and were 22 to 26% smaller than the control for C. gloeosporioides (Table 2). Similarly, wounds treated with calcium propionate had lesions that were 26% smaller than the control for C. acutatum and 24 to 34% smaller than the control for C. gloeo sporioides (Table 2). Lesion diameter at wounds treated with calcium silicate was similar to the control, except in trial 2 with
C. gloeosporioides, in which lesions were 17% smaller (Table 2). With C. acutatum, lesions that developed following treatment had delayed formation of acervuli when compared with the control (Table 2). The delay in acervulus formation was not ob served with C. gloeosporioides.
Wounded fruit of both cultivars pre treated with calcium chloride and then inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia exhibited reduced incidence of infection (62 to 87% less than the control) after inoculations with 1 × 103 conidia per ml of either fungus (Table 3). Golden Deli cious, but not Nittany, fruit treated with calcium propionate and calcium silicate also exhibited reduced disease incidence after inoculation with 1 × 103 conidia per ml of either fungus (Table 3). In tests at 1 × 104 and 1 × 105 conidia per ml, no con sistent treatment effects were observed, and with only three exceptions among the 32 treatment combinations, the control and calcium salt treatments had similar inci dences of infection after inoculation of wounded fruit.
Fruit of both cultivars treated with cal cium chloride exhibited smaller lesions (63 to 72%) after inoculations with 1 × 103 conidia per ml of C. acutatum (Table 4).
Similarly, lesions were 30 to 75% smaller after inoculations of calcium chloride– treated fruit with 1 × 103 conidia of C. gloeosporioides per ml (Table 4). Fruit of both cultivars treated with calcium propi onate exhibited smaller lesions (22 to 70%) after inoculations with 1 × 103 conidia of
C. acutatum per ml (Table 4), whereas lesions were 50% smaller for Golden Deli cious fruit treated with calcium propionate and inoculated with C. gloeosporioides (Table 4). Golden Delicious, but not Nit tany, fruit also exhibited reduced severity after inoculation with all three inoculum concentrations of either fungus (Table 4).
For Nittany, in tests at 1 × 104 and 1 × 105 conidia per ml, the control and calcium salt treatments exhibited similar infection se verity.
Effects of field applications of calcium salts to apple fruit on the incidence and severity of bitter rot. In six separate field trials conducted over 2 years, fruit treated with weekly dilute applications of calcium salts and then inoculated with conidia of either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum had lower incidences of infection com pared with the controls (Tables 5 and 6). In 1997, for Golden Delicious inoculated with
C. acutatum, most infections on control fruit became visible between the first and

In comparison, mean inci dences of infection at 2 weeks postharvest for fruit treated with calcium silicate, cal cium chloride, and calcium propionate were 46, 18, and 8%, respectively. All three salt treatments were significantly different from the control (P = 0.05), and calcium chloride and calcium propionate were similar to each other and different from calcium silicate (P = 0.05) in reduc ing disease incidence. For C. gloeosporioi des, mean incidence of infection at 2 weeks postharvest in the control treatment was 85% compared with 31, 8, and 7% for calcium silicate, calcium chloride, and calcium propionate, respectively. All three salt treatments were significantly different from the control (P = 0.05), and calcium chloride and calcium propionate were similar to each other and different from calcium silicate (P = 0.05) (Table 5).
In 1998, for Nittany inoculated with ei ther fungus, the first appearance of visible symptoms occurred at harvest, compared with 1 week postharvest for Golden Deli cious in 1997. For C. acutatum, most in fections on control fruit became visible between harvest and the first week after harvest, reaching a mean of 51% incidence.
In comparison, mean incidences of infection at 1 week postharvest for fruit treated with calcium hydroxide, calcium chloride, and calcium propionate were 11, 9, and 4%, respectively (Table 6). All three salt treat ments were significantly different from the control and not different from each other (P = 0.05). For C. gloeosporioides, mean inci dence of infection 1 week postharvest in the control was 31%, compared with 9, 6, and 3% for calcium hydroxide, calcium chloride, and calcium propionate, respectively. All three salt treatments were significantly dif ferent from the control and similar to each other (P = 0.05) (Table 6).DISCUSSION
The results of this study demonstrate that calcium salts directly suppress the bitter rot pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. Suppressive effects in clude reduced germ tube growth, reduced mycelial growth in vitro, and reduced se verity of infection of host tissues pretreated with calcium. Also, disease incidence in
Golden Delicious, but not in Nittany, was reduced at the lowest inoculum concentra tion tested. The high susceptibility of Nit tany (3) to the bitter rot pathogens may have resulted in a higher frequency of suc cessful infections at the lowest inoculum concentration compared with Golden Deli cious, which is more resistant. Although calcium salts did not reduce spore germi nation in this study, reduced germination of
Penicillium digitatum spores exposed to calcium chloride has been observed (12), as well as reduced germination and germ tube growth of P. expansum and Botrytis cinerea (14). Calcium salts also have been shown to reduce mycelial growth in vitro and reduce incidence and severity of infec tion of peach fruits and shoots by
Monilinia fructicola and Leucostoma per soonii, respectively (2,4,5).
In the present study, we observed direct inhibition of germ tube elongation and inhibition of mycelial growth in in vitro assays, and it is likely that these effects occur in vivo in the presence of free cal cium ions. The mechanisms by which cal cium salts inhibit germ tube and mycelial growth are not known. One hypothesis is that high external concentrations of Ca2+ may lead to increased concentration of
Ca2+ in the cytosol (12). Since maintenance of low basal concentrations of internal
Ca2+ is essential for normal cell functions, organisms with the inability to regulate intracellular Ca2+ may exhibit compro mised growth and development. Calcium ions may reduce the incidence of fungal infection by directly inhibiting fungal growth and by inhibiting cell wall–de grading enzymes produced by the patho gens (4,5,9,12).
Apples in the mid-Atlantic region are host to a myriad of disease-causing fungi.
Chemical management of apple diseases is usually accomplished so that multiple dis eases are controlled with each fungicide application. The major fungal diseases and pathogens during the early part of the growing season are apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), and cedar-apple rust (Gymno sporangium juniperi-virginianae). After the fruit are set, apple scab can continue to be a problem if scab lesions are present on foliage, and powdery mildew can continue to develop, especially on susceptible culti vars. As fruit develop, they are susceptible to the “summer diseases,” which include bitter rot, white rot (Botryosphaeria do thidea), black rot (B. obtusa), sooty blotch (a complex of fungal organisms), and fly

Plant Disease / November 1999  1005 speck (Zygophiala jamaicensis). The role of calcium supplementation in the inte grated management of apple diseases is not well defined because few organisms among the myriad of apple pathogens have been examined in sufficient detail. Most of our current knowledge pertains to the post harvest pathogens discussed above. In the preharvest environment, calcium chloride and other calcium salts have shown sup pressive activity against V. inaequalis, P. leucotricha, and G. juniperi-virginianae in research trials (A. R. Biggs, unpublished data); however, the early part of the growing season, when these fungi pose the greatest threat, is not when calcium applications would be made for managing calcium-related deficiency disorders, nor does calcium alone provide sufficient suppression of these diseases to prevent economic losses. In the middle to late part of the growing season, when calcium chloride would normally be applied for its fruit quality effects, no reduction in incidence of sooty blotch or flyspeck has been observed, although their severity is often reduced (A. R. Biggs, unpublished).
There are no data on the effects of calcium salts on the incidence of white rot or black rot. Although further research is required, calcium salts may have a future role in disease management of fruit destined for processing, particularly in years when inoculum is low and environ mental conditions are not highly favor able.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
