Colletotrichum. Fungal Diversity 39: 183-204.  
Colletotrichum is the causal agent of anthracnose and other diseases on leaves, stems and fruits of numerous plant species, including several important crops. Accurate species identification is critical to understand the epidemiology and to develop effective control of these diseases. Morphologically-based identification of Colletotrichum species has always been problematic, because there are few reliable characters and many of these characters are plastic, dependent upon methods and experimental conditions. Rapid progress in molecular phylogenetic methods is now making it possible to recognise stable and well-resolved clades within Colletotrichum.  How these should be reflected in a classification system remains to be resolved. An important step in providing a stable taxonomy for the genus is to epitypify existing names, and in so doing link them to genetically defined clades. We recommend a polyphasic approach to the recognition and identification of species within Colletotrichum, matching genetic distinctness with informative morphological and biological characters. This paper reviews various approaches in the study of 
Colletotrichum complexes including morphology, pathogenicity, physiology, phylogenetics and secondary metabolite production. A backbone phylogenetic tree using ITS sequence data from 42 ex-type specimens has been generated. 
Phylogenetic analysis using ITS sequence data is a useful tool to give a preliminarily identification for Colletotrichum species or place them in species complexes. However, caution must be taken here as the majority of the ITS sequences deposited in GenBank are wrongly named. Multi-gene phylogenetic data provides much better understanding of the relationships within Colletotrichum and should be employed where possible. We propose that an ideal approach for 
Colletotrichum systematics should be based on a multi-gene phylogeny, with comparison made with type specimens, and a well-defined phylogenetic lineage should be in conjunction with recognisable polyphasic characters, such as morphology, physiology, pathogenicity, cultural characteristics and secondary metabolites. Finally a set of protocols and methodologies is provided as a guideline for future studies, epitypification and the description of new species.

The need for species recognition 
Colletotrichum Corda is one of the eco nomically most important genera of fungi, being responsible for anthracnose and other 184 diseases of a wide range of plant species (Sutton, 1980; Hyde et al., 2009). The impor tance of a rigid and stable taxonomy for the determination of Colletotrichum species is, therefore, a significant practical concern (She noy et al., 2007). However, there has been considerable difficulty surrounding Colletotri chum systematics, due to the lack of reliable morphological features, making species boun daries ambiguous and confusing. Traditionally many Colletotrichum species have been named after their host, which suggests host specificity amongst species. In what some considered a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological charac ters, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have been since accepted, based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992).  
The difficulty in recognising Colletotri chum species has resulted from: 1) few and variable morphological characters; 2) an exten sive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; 
Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens are often missing or in poor condition thus they can not be used for molecular study and; 4) numerous rDNA ITS (ITS) and other sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI are often erroneously named (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009). To solve the problem of few morphologically informative characters, researchers have utilised other characters such as nucleic acid sequence data, physiology, secondary metabo lites and pathogenicity, as part of a polyphasic approach (Sutton, 1992; Cannon et al. 2000; 
Than et al., 2008a,b; Crouch et al., 2009b; 
Prihastuti et al., 2009). Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleic acid sequences have been successfully used to differentiate species in other difficult genera or groups (e.g. 
Fusarium—Shenoy et al., 2007; Kvas et al., 2009; O’Donnell et al., 2009; Botryosphaeria ceae—Slippers et al., 2004a,b; Crous et al., 2006; Alves et al., 2006, 2008; Phillips et al., 2007); although unsuccessfully in other genera (e.g. Pestalotiopsis—Jeewon et al., 2002, 2003; 
Lee et al., 2006; Hu et al., 2007; Tesjevi et al., 2007). Such data is especially important in species differentiation and understanding the species relationships in Colletotrichum. 
One potential solution for poor type material is to designate an epitype for the species; this stabilises the species name and should provide sequence data as well as living specimens for future research (Hyde and Zhang, 2008). Thirteen species of Colletotrichum have been epitypified and/or newly combined in the genus (Crouch et al., 2006; Shenoy et al., 2007; 
Cannon et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a; Crouch et al., 2009b; Damm et al., 2009; Weir and 
Johnston, in press), while recently described new species have ex-type cultures (Crouch et al., 2009b; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009; Shivas and Tan, 2009; Yang et al., 2009). 
The use of sequences from type specimens is essential when diagnosing Colletotrichum species or studying their phylogenetic relation ships. Where possible, all previously desig nated Colletotrichum gloeosporioides strains should be compared against the recently desig nated epitype of C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al., 2008) to establish if they are correctly named. 
Colletotrichum taxonomy is presently unsatisfactory and there is a pressing need for a polyphasic approach for identification, which reflects the natural classification of species and subspecific taxa within the genus (Sutton, 1992; Cannon et al., 2000). In this paper a taxonomic framework for describing Colleto trichum epitypes and new species is proposed. 
This utilises a multi-gene phylogeny based on type specimens, and well-defined phylogenetic lineages which correlate with recognisable polyphasic characters such as morphology, cultural characteristics, physiology and pathogenicity. The various approaches that have been used or could be incorporated in the study of Colletotrichum species, with recom mended methodologies and discussion on correlation of characters with phylogenetic types are discussed. A phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene (ITS) from specimens including 42 ex-type strains is also provided (Fig. 1).   Fungal Diversity   185 Established methodology  Morphology 
Traditional identification systems in 
Colletotrichum have relied heavily on morpho logical and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998). Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for a precise identi fication, especially for those species in the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. 
Crouch et al. (2009b) considered that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria were taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis in graminicolous 
Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may have consi derable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels. Recognition of this is particularly important for biosecurity, plant breeding and integrated disease management. 
Taxonomy based on morphology alone is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colleto trichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009). 
Available morphological characters of 
Colletotrichum species include: 1) characters on natural substrata, i.e. size and shape of conidiomata (acervuli), conidia, conidiophores and setae; 2) size and shape of conidia, conidiophores and setae in culture; and 3) size and shape of appressoria. Acervuli, setae and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrata can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some species of Colleto trichum, e.g. C. musae and C. gossypii, consis tently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970) and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966).  
Morphological characters may vary with environmental factors, and incubation condi tions, such as media and temperature, should be standardized (Cannon et al., 2000) for species comparison and identification. Unfor tunately, there is no recommended standard for 
Colletotrichum cultivation. For example, 
Baxter et al. (1983) described species of 
Colletotrichum based on growth on MSA and 
CDY at 20ºC; Sutton (1980) used potato dextrose agar (PDA) under alternating 12 hours near ultra violet irradiation / 12 hour dark at 25ºC; others have used PDA in the dark at 25ºC (Shivas et al., 1998; Nirenberg et al., 2002) or; synthetic nutrient-poor agar (SNA) medium and Anthriscus stems incubated under permanent near ultra violet light at 20 ºC (Damm et al., 2009). Thus, it is difficult to compare morphological and cultural characters due to variation and inconsistency in methodology. To compare isolates/species, a standardised protocol for cultivation of strains should be applied.  
Observations and measurements of coni dial size and shape have usually been made using conidial masses mounted in water, cotton blue, or lactic acid (Cannon et al., 2008). It should be noted that many species of Colleto trichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when com pared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). 
Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterised the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used PDA with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the under surface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). 
Conidial appressoria have been recorded when  conidia are germinated in drops of deionised water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). 
Conidial appressoria are taxonomically unin formative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species, but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that 186 conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. 
The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate or lobed, occasionally becoming complex. In C. hymenocallidis they are ovate or sometimes clavate 
Cultural characteristics on agar media have been applied for the diagnosis of some 
Colletotrichum species (von Arx, 1957). The conidial morphology of C. gloeosporioides and 
C. lindemuthianum are similar, but their cultural characters are distinctly different. 
Colletotrichum lindemuthianum produces dark pigmentation in media and grows consistently slower than C. gloeosporioides (Baxter et al., 1983; Sutton, 1992). Likewise, C. musae grows relatively fast, forming effuse colonies and glabrous conidiomata with many conidia, while 
C. destructivum forms large conidiogenous zones with scattered, relatively short setae and has limited conidial production (Baxter et al., 1983).  
The shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as cultural characters should be evaluated and used with caution, as these characters are highly dependent on the growth conditions. Erroneous diagnosis can largely be avoided if morphology is used in conjunction with other characters such as molecular sequence data, biochemical and physiological characteristics and host range. 
Crouch et al. (2009b) demonstrated that the falcate-spored, grass-associated Colletotrichum species could be distinguished by a combi nation of molecular data, appressorial morpho logy and host range. However, for most 
Colletotrichum species host range has not been determined and available information should be considered with caution, as it is often based on wrongly identified species (Damm et al., 2009).   Molecular phylogeny 
Due to the inadequacies and plasticity of morphological characters, nucleic acid se quence analysis has been regarded as more reliable for Colletotrichum classification (Sutton, 1992; Cannon et al., 2000; Crouch et al., 2009a,b; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009). A major drawback in the reliance on a small proportion of the genome to understand phylogenetic relationships amongst Colletotri chum strains has been the risk of recreating gene trees rather than species trees (Cannon et al., 2000). Thus, multi-gene phylogenetics are employed to systematically characterise Col letotrichum species relationships and to serve as a base for species diagnosis (Crouch et al., 2006, 2009b; Farr et al., 2006; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009). Prihastuti et al. (2009) used six genes, the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, partial 
Actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), Calmodulin (CAL), Glutamine synthetase (GS) and Glyce raldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) to study a few closely related Colletotrichum species (C. gloeosporioides sensu lato) and established that species relationships could be well resolved. Multi-gene phylogenies were also successfully applied to resolve the relationships among Colletotrichum species with curved conidia from graminicolous and from herbaceous hosts (Crouch et al., 2009b; 
Damm et al., 2009). Multi-gene phylogenetics is an accurate and reliable way for the diagnosis of Colletotrichum species, but is neither very efficient nor economical. It is currently impractical to apply multiple gene phylogenetics to every Colletotrichum species, as different research groups use different gene regions. An international collaborative effort is essential in order to standardise research being carried out on the genus. Hyde et al. (2009) listed all the multi-gene sequences derived from the type or epitype cultures of Colleto trichum. This provides an excellent platform for data analysis that aims to study the natural relationships among species.  
The ITS region is the most widely sequenced region but there are some concerns as to whether ITS sequence data can provide adequate resolution to determine and differen tiate Colletotrichum species. Crouch et al. (2009d) have revealed a high error rate and frequency of misidentification (86%) based on 
ITS sequence similarity comparison within the 
C. graminicola species complex. ITS sequence data in the public domain can cause consi derable confusion to the end user; sequence data were often entered under an incorrect specific name and which may comprise several cryptic species. Identical sequence data has regularly been entered under different names. Fungal Diversity   187 
We analysed 343 ITS sequences named “C. gloeosporioides” (accessed on 6 Sept 2009) and found that >86% had considerable evolutionary divergence from the type speci men of C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al., 2008), and most likely represent other Colle totrichum species. It is paramount that sequence data generated from type specimens are used in species similarity comparisons and phylogenetic analysis. Due to ease of acqui sition and an extensive library of existing sequences, the ITS region is still useful in some cases for reconstruction of interspecific rela tionships, although it is not an ideal marker for inferring infraspecific relationships. Currently, 
ITS is also the only gene region that is available from all the ex-type or ex-epitype cultures of Colletotrichum species (Table 1). 
We provide a phylogenetic tree based on ITS sequence data, which includes sequences originated from 42 ex-type or ex-epitype cultures, in order to provide a backbone tree for further diagnosis in Colletotrichum (Fig. 1). 
Taxon names, GenBank accession numbers, culture collection numbers, hosts and origins of the strains are provided in Table 1. The analysis was conducted following the methodo logy outlined by Cai et al. (2008, 2009). The backbone tree can be used to provide a rough, quick identification guide to Colletotrichum species. 
Colletotrichum systematics should utilise a multiple-gene phylogeny and a study of type specimens to establish correlations between the genotype and phenotype. The phenotype should be expanded to a polyphasic sense (morphology, physiology, pathogenicity, infec tion processes, cultural characteristics and secondary metabolites) (Frisvad, 2004; Samson and Varga, 2007). The genotypes in Colleto trichum appear to correlate with a combination of characters but not with a single character. 
These criteria are clearly demonstrated by 
Crouch et al. (2009b), Damm et al. (2009) and 
Prihastuti et al. (2009). Crouch et al. (2009b) correlated the well-defined phylogenetic group ings with combined characters of appressoria and host ranges. Prihastuti et al. (2009) established new taxa in the C. gloeosporioides complex that form distinct phylogenetic lineages with distinct morphological, cultural and physiological characteristics. Taylor et al. (2000) suggested that a genealogical concor dance method should be used to recognise a phylogenetic species, with three criteria for each lineage, i.e. monophyletic, statistically supported and genealogically concordant (i.e. no conflict among the single gene tree). Our proposal is broader as we also emphasize the importance of correlation with phenotypic characters, so as to develop species concepts in a systematic, biological sense.  
Physiology, carbon source utilization and growth rate 
Patterns of carbohydrate utilization have been used to resolve the classification of 
Penicillium species (Bridge, 1985) and this has also been employed to differentiate Colletotri chum species (Waller et al., 1993; Prihastuti et al., 2009). Colletotrichum kahawae Waller & 
Bridge is an economically important pathogen causing coffee berry disease in Africa, which could be distinguished from other Colletotri chum species on coffee by its inability to utilize citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source (Waller et al., 1993; Prihastuti et al., 2009). 
There have been considerable controversies as to whether Colletotrichum kahawae should be a valid species or a sub-population of C. gloeosporioides, as C. kahawae can only be distinguished from C. gloeosporioides and other close relatives by biochemical and phy siological characters (Correll et al., 2000; 
Cannon et al., 2000). Recent phylogenetic analysis using multi-gene data showed that C. kahawae is genetically distinct from other close related species in the complex (Prihastuti et al., 2009). This serves as a good demonstration for correlation between genotypes and phenotypes. 
Relative growth rates in culture is a useful criterion for differentiating some 
Aspergillus and Penicillium species (Frisvad, 2004; Frisvad et al., 2007; Samson and Varga, 2007) and this character has also been employed in delimitating Colletotrichum species. For example, Colletotrichum acutatum grows significantly slower than C. gloeo sporioides and can be distinguished by growth rate (Sutton, 1992). Than et al. (2008b) and 
Prihastuti et al. (2009) showed a good correlation between growth rate in culture and multi-gene phylogeny in species causing chilli anthracnose and coffee berry disease in 188

Thailand. Colletotrichum asianum could easily be distinguished from C. fructicola and C. siamense (all from coffee) by its much slower growth rate (Prihastuti et al., 2009).  
The usefulness of physiological charac ters in differentiating closely related species in 
Colletotrichum has been well demonstrated in a few species. Unfortunately, such physiological characterizations have not been made for most 
Colletotrichum species. In this paper, we suggest that the carbohydrate utilization and relative growth rate should be used as one of the polyphasic characters to study Colletotri chum, especially for those morphologically indistinguishable species that bear phylogene tic distinctiveness.    Pathogenicity testing 
It is important to establish whether a particular Colletotrichum species is host specific or has a wide host range. Host-specific taxa may have a limited distribution, which may have important biosecurity implications. If the taxon has a wide host range the species is likely to be cosmopolitan and possibly an opportunistic pathogen. Host range studies may provide data useful in classification and future delimitation of species. Koch’s postulates have been completed to confirm the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates. For example, 
Vinnere et al. (2002) showed that Rhododen dron anthracnose was caused by C. acutatum; 
Lee et al. (2005) re-infected Euonymus leaves with C. boninense in moist chamber pathogeni city tests; Tomioka et al. (2008) showed that a species referred to as C. dematium (but see 
Damm et al., 2009) was the causal agent of severe spotting, blight and drop of leaves of 
Polygonatum falcatum. Descriptions of new species sometimes include data on pathogeni city testing (Nakamura et al., 2006; Moriwaki and Tsukiboshi 2009; Yang et al., 2009), although this is not usually the case (e.g. Farr et al., 2006). Crouch et al. (2009c) confirmed that a new species, C. navitas, caused anthrac nose of Panicum virgatum. Much of the pathogenicity work that has been carried out needs repeating with verified Colletotrichum species. For example, pathogenicity tests using 
C. acutatum, C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides isolates from chili were carried out on susceptible and resistant varieties of chili (Than et al., 2008b) but names of the Colletotrichum species used need to be re-examined in light of a re-assessment of some of these Colletotri chum species (Shivas and Tan, 2009). Papers epitypifying plant pathogenic taxa should ideally include pathogenicity testing, but this has not usually been done (e.g. Shenoy et al., 2007; Cannon et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a; 
Crouch et al., 2009b; Weir and Johnston, in press).   Other possible methods  Cross mating experiments 
A cross mating test is an in vitro experiment employed to recognise fungal species based on the biological species concept (Mayr, 1940; Taylor et al., 2000). In biological species recognition, groups of mating com patible individuals are regarded as the same species (Taylor et al., 2000). There are major obstacles that limit the application of this theory to fungi including: 1) many fungi are asexual (they may have permanently lost the ability to reproduce sexually) and do not produce ascospores (Reynolds, 1993); 2) some species are able to produce ascospores without a partner (homothallic), e.g. C. falcatum and C. graminicola (von Arx and Müller, 1954; Politis, 1975; Vaillancourt and Hanaui, 1991); 3) failure of some heterothallic fungi to mate in artificial cultivation; and 4) there is much evidence that groups of genetically isolated fungi may retain the ancestral characters of interbreeding. A common result is that mating tests may define species that encompass more than one genetically and phylogenetically iso lated groups (Perkins and Turner, 1988; Chase and Ullrich, 1990; Vilgalys and Sun, 1994; Petersen and Hughes, 1999). 
There have been few studies using cross mating tests to distinguish between Colletotri chum species. Guerber et al. (2003) tested isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato and concluded that two phylogenetically iso lated clades have retained the ability to mate. 
Genetic isolation appears to have occurred before reproductive isolations in the C. acuta tum complex. In the case of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, sexual compatibility had been reported to be limited to individuals that share the same host range (Brasier, 1987). 192 
Cisar et al. (1994) discovered that some iso lates of C. gloeosporioides that are pathogenic to distantly related hosts are also sexually compatible. This result is in agreement with studies on C. acuatum, i.e. genetically isolated strains may retain the ability to mate. Similar findings have been reported for Fusarium and other fungi (Donoghue, 1985; Taylor et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2001; Amata et al., in press). 
It is noteworthy that most Colletotrichum species lack a sexual state (Hyde et al., 2009), and many of the known teleomorphs, such as those of C. graminicola and C. sublineolum (Carvajal and Edgerton, 1944; Politis, 1975; 
Vaillancourt and Hanau, 1992), are charac terised based on mating experiments in the laboratory. In this sense, mating experiments are important for a comprehensive under standing of Colletotrichum species and should be undertaken in studies on Colletotrichum.   Secondary metabolite profiles 
There have been numerous publications on secondary metabolite production by Colle totrichum species and the chemical structures of some of these metabolites have been elucidated. However there have been few attempts to use metabolite profiling as a source of markers for identification and classification purposes (O’Connell et al., 1998; Abang et al., 2009), or to integrate chemotaxonomy within a polyphasic framework for resolving natural relationships of taxa within Colletotrichum. 
Secondary metabolite production has been extensively studied in putative strains of C. capsici, C. dematium, C. fragariae, C. gloeo sporioides, C. lagenarium, C. nicotianae and C. truncatum but was not linked to taxonomy (García-Pajón and Collado, 2003). This is in distinct contrast to Alternaria, Annulohy poxylon, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Hypoxylon, 
Penicillium, Stachybotrys, Stemphylium, and 
Trichoderma species, where secondary meta bolites have been found to be valuable taxonomic markers (Stadler et al., 2004; 
Frisvad et al., 2007, 2008; Anderson et al., 2008;).  
One of the few studies of secondary metabolites as taxonomic markers for dis tinguishing Colletotrichum spp. involved the use of lectins - proteins or glycoproteins that contain binding sites complementary in shape to particular monosaccharides or oligosaccha rides (O’Connell et al., 1998). Although lectin cytochemistry proved to be valuable as a chemotaxonomic tool, the technique is limited by the relatively small number of sugars that are recognised by lectins. A further limitation of this approach is the difficulty to interpret assay results when lectins show affinity for more than one sugar or when binding involves non-specific hydrophobic or ionic interactions (O’Connell et al., 1998). O’Connell et al. (1998) proposed the use of monoclonal anti bodies (MAb) in studies of Colletotrichum identification and chemotaxonomy because they offer a much wider range of binding sites than lectins. Although antibodies have been used in identification of species such as C. gloeosporioides (Peters et al., 1998) and in taxonomic studies of zoosporic fungi (Hard ham et al., 1991), their wider applicability in resolving Colletotrichum systematics remains to be investigated. 
Morphotype, virulence phenotype, phylo type and chemotype were recently used in a polyphasic approach to clarify the taxonomic status of Colletotrichum isolates associated with anthracnose disease of yam (Dioscorea spp.) (Abang et al., 2009). Four morphotypes of C. gloeosporioides sensu lato were recog nised associated with foliar anthracnose of yam: slow growing grey (SGG); fast growing salmon (FGS); fast-growing grey (FGG); and fast growing olive (FGO). The FGG morphotype showed a greater divergence from the other three morphotypes based on ITS sequence data. 
Secondary metabolite profiles in high perfor mance TLC (HPTLC) and high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) showed that the pathogenic SGG and FGS forms had a chemotype (A or B) that was distinct from the non-pathogenic FGG form (chemotype C). A highly phytotoxic HPLC fraction was detected in virulent FGS and SGG strains, but was not detected in the FGG strains. It was not possible to distinguish the pathogenic FGS from SGG forms of Colletotrichum based on their ITS based phylotype; however, they could be clearly distinguished based on their combined 
ITS and metabolite profiles (Abang et al., 2009), which corroborated a previous finding that these strains represented two genetically distinct populations of C. gloeosporioides 
Fungal Diversity   193 sensu lato on yam (Abang et al., 2005). The presence of outliers stresses the necessity to have a large number of correctly identified strains of the same taxon for robust chemo taxonomic analyses (Anderson et al., 2008).  
The chemotaxonomic approach used to elucidate the taxonomic status of Colletotri chum from yam could be applied to resolve the systematics of the genus as a whole. Frisad et al. (2008) noted that, “the use of secondary metabolite profiling seems to be of greatest value in Ascomycetes…” which should motivate those planning to apply this tool to 
Glomerella/Colletotrichum taxonomy. There are important methodological considerations that should be borne in mind in chemotaxo nomic studies, many of which have been discussed by Frivad et al. (2008) and Anderson et al. (2008). For instance, fungal cultures used in comparative chemotaxonomic analysis should be grown on the same medium, incu bated together at the same temperature, and extracted at the same time, to ensure that differences reflected fungal diversity and not environmental conditions (Frisad et al., 2008). 
HPLC methods also need to be standardized and the lack of standards for certain known metabolites makes it difficult to identify many peaks in HPLC-DAD chromatograms.  
A new approach to Colletotrichum systematics, which utilizes metabolite profiling (thus bringing functional characters to the fore), may help provide a better understanding of species relationships in this genus. The correct identification of a species and its strains using 
ITS and other sequence data, is, however, essential before such studies can take place. 
Research in chemotaxonomy in Colletotrichum is at an early stage and recommendations are not made here.  Infraspecific taxonomy 
Infraspecific groups within Colletotri chum species are poorly understood and have been mostly avoided in the paper on current names (Hyde et al., 2009). The current Code of 
Botanical Nomenclature provides a few formal infraspecific categories: subspecies, variety and form. Categories such as forma specialis and pathotype have also been used by plant patho logists for infraspecific groups with distinct host specializations or behaviours (Cannon, 2000). 
The use of subspecies, varieties and forms within Colletotrichum have been va riously used with 33 introductions between 1940 and 2000. The fact that forma species or varieties were intermittently used appear to have depended as much on individual authors as on any rules and until a clear understanding of what constitutes a Colletotrichum species it may be unwise to consider subspecies, forms and varieties any further. From a pathology view point there has been more recent use of forma specialis and pathotype, with pathotypes being most frequently used in the genus (Lubbe et al., 2004; Suman et al., 2005; Moore et al., 2008).  
For true pathotype differences there must be a qualitative or phenotypic difference in infection (virulence) between isolates on a set of differential genotypes (Taylor and Ford, 2007). A quantitative difference in severity of infection based on lesion size is simply a reflection of the variation of aggressiveness of isolates and does not constitute a true pathotype difference (Taylor and Ford, 2007). 
Identification of pathotypes of Colletotri chum species has been based on both qualita tive differences in infection, e.g. C. trifolii in lucerne (Mackie et al., 2003); C. lindemuthia num in bean (Gonzalez-Chavira et al., 2004); C. acutatum in citrus (You et al., 2007); C. sublineolum in sorghum (Moore et al., 2008); 
C. capsici in chili pepper (Montri et al., 2009);  
C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides in chili pepper (Monkolporn et al., 2010) and quantitative differences in severity (C. capsici in chili pepper, Sharma et al. 2005; C. falcatum in sugarcane, Suman et al., 2005) between isolates on specific host genotypes.  
There have been some reports of races of 
Colletotrichum species; however, races of a fungal pathogen only occur where differences in isolates are determined by differences in virulence genes and corresponding host resis tance genes, i.e. a gene for gene relationship as occurs in rust diseases. Mackie et al. (2007) linked races 1, 2 and 4 of C. trifolii to quanti tative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance to 
C. trifolii in lucerne.  However, since the relationship between specific genes for 194 avirulence in the pathogen and resistance genes in the host has not been established, these variations in the pathogen should be referred to as pathotypes as described by Irwin et al. (2006). 
The identification of pathotypes is not only important as a taxonomic tool at the infraspecific level of a Colletotrichum species, but has implications for plant breeders trying to develop new improved genotypes with durable resistance to a pathogen. Pathotypic differences actually help to relate the infraspecific taxo nomy back to the biological interaction of the pathogen to specific genotypes of a host.  The future  
The identification of Colletotrichum species needs to be simple and quick as it has important implications for biosecurity, disease control and plant breeding. There is now a major effort to establish species concepts and formalise names in current use. It is unlikely that morphology will solve many problems in species delineation, but a polyphasic approach can be used to establish species boundaries, for epitypification of existing names and for the introduction of new species. Ideally, a single gene will be found that can be used for barcode-like identification of species in a quick and simple way.  
Searching a suitable gene for barcoding  
DNA barcoding aims to establish an accurate, rapid, cost-effective and universally accessible identification system for organisms by using short and standardised segments of the genome (Herbert et al., 2003, 2004; 
Summerbell et al., 2005). It is particularly important to establish a DNA barcoding system for Colletotrichum species, as they have very simple morphologies and the current taxonomy is very confused. The success of Colleto trichum barcoding relies on highly reliable sequences from the type or verified strains and the selection of most appropriate of gene(s). 
The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides spe cies complex contains taxa with significant biological, morphological, and genetic diver sity (Sutton, 1992; Hyde et al., 2009). Some of these taxa have been named as separate species e.g. C. fragariae (Johnston et al., 2008). ITS region has a poor ability to discriminate clades within this group, hence a more appropriate biomarker is required for use in barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding has low heterogeneity within species, yet enough varia tion to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement allows strains of the same species to be easily grouped and identified. The second requirement ensures that misidentifications are minimised. It is also important, that the gene can be easily se quenced for all species and does not require specific primers for each group (Seifert, 2009; 
Gilmore et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009). 
We used a diverse set of 64 Colleto trichum gloeosporioides sensu lato isolates (and two C. boninense strains as outgroups) previously analysed by Johnston et al. (2008). 
Each isolate was sequenced with six genes: ITS, 
GPDH (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), 
CAL (calmodulin), ACT (actin), CHS (chitin synthase), and EF1α (elongation factor 1α). 
The 64 taxa were assigned to five groups on the basis of a multigene phylogeny (Johnston et al., 2008). Two groups represented named species (C. fragariae and C. horii) and one group represented Colletotrichum gloeospo rioides sensu stricto. The remaining two groups A and B (sensu Johnston and Jones, 1997) consisted of diverse mostly unnamed isolates, although C. musae is in Group A, and 
C. kahawae is in Group B. A similarity matrix was generated for each gene, and results were analysed in TaxonGap 2.4.1 (Slabbinck et al., 2008). 
The results (Fig. 2) graphically summa rise the heterogeneity within each of the assigned groups (light grey bar), and the sepa rability of species (dark grey bar). Separability represents the ability of the gene to distinguish between groups, the minimum separability of 
GPDH, CAL, ACT, and EF1α is good at 12.2, 11.7, 9.5, and 9.9, respectively. In contrast ITS and CHS have low minimum separability values of 3.9 and 0.3, respectively. 
The heterogeneity values (intra-species variation) ideally should be low, certainly less than the respective separability value. In most cases this is true, with the notable exception of 
EF1α in Groups A, B, sensu stricto, and C. boninense. This is likely the result of the high variability of introns in EF1α sequences of Fungal Diversity   195 
Fig. 2. Comparison of intra- and inter-species variation for six potential barcode genes. Species / groups were ordered according to their position in a maximum likelihood phylogenetic tree generated from concatenated sequences of representative strains. Separability (inter-species variation) is presented as dark grey bars, and heterogeneity (intra species variation) is presented as light grey bars. The vertical black line denotes the smallest separability recorded. C. boninense was used as an outgroup.   
Colletotrichum species, which is likely to be more useful in population level studies, rather than systematics or barcoding. Across all the genes the heterogeneity values for Groups A and B are high, this may imply that these groups consist of several different taxa, and should be subdivided further. It can be concluded from this analysis that within 
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato 
GPDH, CAL, and ACT are good candidates for barcodes; whilst ITS, CHS, and EF1α are poor candidates. 
A similar set of six genes (ITS, ACT, 
CHS, GPDH, histone 3, beta-tubulin) was used by Damm et al. (2009) for studying Colleto trichum species with curved conidia from herbaceous hosts, which included six different clades. The separability of the species was best with both GPDH and histone 3 genes, which are superior to ITS, ACT, CHS and beta tubulin. 
The most appropriate gene for barcoding 
Colletotrichum must be selected in the process of species delimitation, since we can only decide for one or more barcoding gene(s) when we know which taxa need to be distinguished by it. A good approach would be to test and establish a selection of loci used by the different groups involved in Colletotrichum systematics in order to work towards the best barcoding gene.   
Detailed protocols for studying Colletotri chum species  Isolation 
Endophytes and pathogens without visible sporulation: Plant tissues are cut into small pieces, surface sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute, in 70% ethanol for 1 minute and rinsed three times with sterilized water and finally dried on sterilized tissue paper. The plant tissues are then placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml tetracycline to allow fungal growth. The mycelia growing from pieces of plant tissues are transferred onto a new PDA plate for morphological or molecular study (Than et al., 2008b).  
Pathogens or epiphytes with visible sporulation: A single spore isolation technique should be applied to plant tissues where spore masses are formed. Spore masses are trans ferred with a sterilized wire loop or fine forceps and suspended in sterilized water. The spore suspension is diluted to a reasonable concentration and spread onto the surface of 
PDA agar, followed by incubation overnight at 25°C. Single germinated spores are picked up with a sterilised needle and transferred onto new PDA plate for further study (Goh et al., 1999).  Morphological studies 
There is a need to standardise incubation parameters for Colletotrichum species as it is difficult or impossible to compare the morpho logy of species that have been grown under different conditions. For inoculation, it is suggested to aseptically punch and transfer a mycelial disc (about 4 mm diam.) from the 196 actively growing edge of a 5 day old single conidium derived culture onto PDA. Cultures are incubated at 20, 25 and 30°C under constant fluorescent light. We do not suggest 
Sutton’s protocol as we think the switch of ultra violet irradiation and dark is not always practical and may bring in many more factors that might impact the growth of fungus. Three replicate cultures of each isolate should be investigated. After 7 days, conidial size and shape from >25 conidia should be measured and recorded, while colony characters can be recorded and photographed (Than et al., 2008a). 
Observation and measurements (e.g. conidial size, appressoria size and conidiogenous cells) should be made in water mounts.  
Appressoria should be produced using a slide culture technique, in which 10 mm2 plugs of PDA are placed in an empty Petri dish. The edge of the agar is inoculated with spores taken from a sporulating culture and a sterile cover slip is placed over the inoculated agar (John ston and Jones, 1997). After 7 days, the shape and size of the appressoria formed on the underside of the cover slip could be recorded (Fig. 3).   Multi-locus phylogeny  
Multi-locus phylogeny is a powerful tool to diagnose Colletotrichum species and has been widely employed (Johnston et al., 2008; 
Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009; 
Yang et al., 2009). Unfortunately, dif-ferent research groups have been utilizing different gene regions. For example Crouch et al. (2009b) used ITS, Apn2, Sod2 and Mat1-2 gene regions; Prihastuti et al. (2009) used ITS, 
CAL, GS, GPDH, ACT and TUB2 gene regions; Johnston et al. (2008) employed additional gene regions such as EF1α and CHS. 
To facilitate future study and comprehensive comparison of Colletotrichum species, it is important that an agreement should be formed on how many and which genes should be sequenced. An even more important issue is the interpretation of phylogenetic groups in terms of classification. Currently there is no con sensus over what constitutes a species, although researchers started to adopt “genealo gical concordance” to recognise phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). In this paper we suggest that species rank should be given to well defined phylogenetic lineages that are in conjunction with recognisable phenotypic characters.   Growth rate 
Punch and aseptically transfer a mycelial disc (about 4 mm diam.) from the actively growing edge of a 5 day old single conidium derived culture onto PDA. Cultures are incubated at 25°C under constant fluorescent light. Three replicate cultures of each isolate should be investigated. Colony diameter of the culture is measured daily for 7 days. Growth rate can be calculated as the 7 day average of mean daily growth (mm per day). After 7 days, colony size and colour of the conidial masses and zonation should be recorded.  Biochemical tests 
Biochemical testing can also be utilized as it has been reported in several studies that biochemical characters, especially the ability to utilize citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source could be used to differentiate some closely related species (Bridge et al., 2008; Prihastuti et al., 2009). The biochemical test based on substrate utilization could be assessed in agar plates according to the method of Bridge et al. (2008). Utilization of citrate and tartrate as a carbon source are assayed on agar plates. 
Medium B (contains NH3H2PO4 1.0g/L; KCl 0.2 g/L; MgSO4.7H2O 0.2g/L in distilled water) with 1.2% (w/v) agar is supplemented with 1% (w/v) citric acid or ammonium tartrate and 0.005% (w/v) bromocresol purple (Waller et al., 1993; Bridge et al., 2008). Positive and nega tive controls containing, respectively, glucose or no additional carbon source are included for each isolate.  
All media should be adjusted to pH 4.5 with NaOH or HCl prior to sterilization (Waller et al., 1993; Bridge et al., 2008). Test media are inoculated with agar plugs (4 mm diam) taken from 5 day old single conidium derived cultures. Utilization is assessed by visual comparison of growth and a rise in the pH of the medium adequate to produce a dark blue to purple colour of bromocresol purple (Waller et al., 1993; Bridge et al., 2008).

Preparation of inocula and test hosts 
Pure cultures of each isolate are grown on PDA for 7–14 days at 25oC under alternating 12 hour fluorescent light /12 hour dark cycle to induce sporulation (Than et al., 2008b). The conidia are harvested by placing 1–5 ml sterilized distilled water onto the culture, which is then gently swirled and scraped to harvest the conidia. The conidial suspension is filtered through two layers of muslin cloth. The spore density is adjusted to a concentration of 1 × 106 spore/ml using a haemocytometer (Tshering, 2006). 
Freshly harvested, untreated, mature but unripe fruits, leaves or other part plants are washed under running tap water for 60 seconds followed by surface sterilization by immersing the fruits in 70% ethanol for 3 minutes, 1% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 minutes and then rinsing three times in sterilised distilled water for 2 minutes each time and drying with sterile tissue paper and then air drying (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Montri et al., 2009).   Inoculation 
The surface sterilized fruits and leaves are placed in a plastic box that contains sterile tissue paper soaked in sterile distilled water to maintain around 95% relative humidity (Montri et al., 2009). The samples are inoculated using the wound/drop and non-wound /drop inoculation methods (Lin et al., 2002; 
Kanchana-udomkan et al., 2004; Than et al., 2008b). Inoculation with wound/drop method is accomplished by pin-pricking the fruits or leaf with a sterile needle in the middle portion of fruit or leaf and then placing 6 μl of conidia suspension onto the wound (Freeman and 
Shabi, 1996; Than et al., 2008b). Control fruits and leaves are inoculated with 6 μl of sterile distilled water. The inoculated samples are incubated in containers at room temperature in normal light regimes for 7–14 days (Figs 4–5) (Than et al., 2008b). The non-wound/drop method involves placing 6 μl of conidial suspension onto the middle of each fruit or leaf (Lin et al., 2002; Kanchana-udomkan et al., 2004).     
Fig. 4. Incubation of fruits inoculated with spore suspension.  
Disease evaluation and data analysis 
Evaluation of anthracnose symptoms such as lesion appearance, lesion size, conidia characteristics and the severity of infection is carried out from 7 to 14 days after inoculation (Figs 6–7). Lesion development on fruits and leaves are assessed by the percentage of disease area on each fruit and leaf (lesion area divided by the total fruit/leaf area). Symptoms are evaluated and scored on a 0-9 point scale based on the percentage of the infected area as outlined by Montri et al. (2009) (Table 2).  198 
Table 2. Anthracnose severity scores and the symptom description.  
Score Symptom description 0 no infection. 1  1–2% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesion or a larger water soaked lesion surrounding the infection site.  3  >2–5% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesion, acervuli may be present/or water lesion up to 5% of the fruit surface.  5 >5–15% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesion, acervuli present/or water soaked lesion up to 25% of the fruit surface.  7 >15–25% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesion with acervuli  9 >25% of the fruit area shows necrosis, lesion often encircling the fruit, abundant acervuli.     
Fig.5. Incubation of leaves inoculated with spore suspension.  
It is worth mentioning that artificial inoculations are often conducted on detached or whole plants under extreme conditions and the success of infection appears to be dependent on inoculum density (Bailey and 
Jeger, 1992), whereas no infection may occur under field conditions (Freeman et al., 1998). 
Artificial host inoculation is, to some extent, not reliable for determining host range or host specificity, but is an indicator of infection potential (Freeman et al., 1998). Some research has shown that pathogenicity tests may not be reliable on detached plant tissues because of suppression of host defense pathways (Liu et al., 2007).  Mating test 
We suggest the protocol as outlined by 
Guerber and Correll (2001) and Guerber et al. (2003). Modified Czapek-dox agar media (2 g 
NaNO3, 1 g K2HPO4, 0.5 g MgSO4·H2O, 0.5 g 
KCl, 0.01 g FeSO4 and 20 g agar, per liter, pH7.8) is used. For inoculation, aseptically punch and transfer a mycelial disc (4 mm diam.) from the actively growing edge of a 5 day old single conidium derived culture to the agar. 
Two parental isolates are placed opposite to each other and approximately 1 cm from the edge of 9 cm Petri plates. Autoclaved flat woody toothpicks are applied to serve as a substrate for ascomata formation. Three toothpicks are placed on the agar in an “N” arrangement. Plates are incubated at 25ºC under constant cool white fluorescent light. 
After 20–30 days, the mating plates are examined under a microscope for the presence of ascomata. Successful crosses result in a ridge of mature ascomata containing asci with ascospores being formed at the line of contact. 
Ascomata are removed from the toothpick using fine forceps and mounted in a drop of sterilized water and crushed under a cover slip. 
A combination of a qualitative and quantitative rating system is used to score the sexual fertility of each cross. Fertility of cross is scored on a scale of 0–7 (Guerber et al., 2003): 0 = no structures; 1 = small sterile structures; 2 = sterile perithecia with beaks, no asci; 3 = sterile perithecia with asci, no ascospores; 4 = asci with a few ascospores; 5 = fertile perithecia with many ascospores, few asci with eight spores; 6 = fertile perithecia with abundant ascospores, many asci with eight spores; 7 = perithecia exuding ascospores from ostiole. Crosses scored 5 or higher are considered fertile. Ascospore viability should be assessed for crosses with a fertility score above 4. Monoascospore cultures are obtained by removing an individual ascomata and placing it into drop of sterile water. The ascospores released into the water are spread onto PDA for growth.   Concluding remarks 
Species concepts in Colletotrichum have evolved from the use of basic morphological Fungal Diversity   199

Fig. 7. Symptom on leaves 7 days after inoculation. data to a polyphasic scrutiny incorporating a powerful molecular component. This has re sulted in traditional classification being less practical, as holotypes or other types are pre sently not very useful as DNA cannot usually be extracted.  
It is recommended that a polyphasic approach should be adopted in future studies before new species of Colletotrichum are introduced or epitypes are designated, and should incorporate molecular, morphological, physiological, and pathogenic data. In the following section we summarise the recommended protocols.   
Protocols for describing new species and epitypes  1. A detailed morphological description of the fungus should be provided (see 
Colletotrichum fructicola Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Fungal Diversity 39: 96 and 
C. anthrisci Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, 
Fungal Diversity 39: 12 for examples). 2. In addition to any distinctive morpho logical or other polyphasic characters, the proposed new species should show suf ficient evolutionary divergence from other closely related taxa based on a multiple gene sequence analysis, and it is essential that any comparisons should be made with type specimens.  3. It is recommended that multiple gene loci should be characterized such as ITS, TUB2, 
GPDH, ACT and others. Sequences should be deposited in a recognised international database. 4. Media used for descriptions and compari son should be as recommended in this paper. Where possible a description should also be provided from a collection on host tissues. 5. The ex-type cultures of any new Colleto trichum species should be deposited in at least two internationally recognised culture collections (preferably more), and all information should be registered in 
MycoBank. 6. Details of growth rate in a standard me dium at a standard temperature and growth condition should be included. 7. Three basic rules should be taken into account when considering the suitability of a specific specimen and derived culture to serve as epitype and ex-epitype (Mcneill et al., 2006). The strain should be A) from the original host, B) from the original geographic locality and C) have well 200 matched morphology and other phenotypic characters as the type which should be examined if available and preferentially illustrated. When an epitype is designated, the holotype, lectotype, or neotype that the epitype supports must be explicitly cited (Mcneill et al., 2006). 8. Pathogenicity testing may be useful and should be carried out where possible.  Acknowledgements
