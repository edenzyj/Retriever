We studied, by means of field experiments, the combined effects of irrigation system, mulching material and genetic resistance on the incidence of strawberry anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum acutatum. All trials involved artificial inoculation with fruits colonized by the pathogen. One experiment examined the effects of drip irrigation, overhead sprinkler irrigation, and localized low-pressure tape irrigation, and the effects of grass (Brachiaria sp.) and plastic (polyethylene) mulches, in a split plot, randomized complete block design with four replicates. Lower disease incidence, indicating lower pathogen dispersal, was verified with low-pressure tape and drip irrigation. Flower blight and fruit rot incidence in drip-irrigated plots was minimal (ca. 2% of the disease levels in the plots otherwise irrigated). Grass mulch reduced flower blight in the sprinkler system (up to 80%), but had no significant effect when disease levels were already low due to use of other irrigation systems. A second experiment compared the effects of grass mulch, pine (Pinus elliotti) mulch, and plastic mulch with overhead sprinkler irrigation on strawberry cultivars partially resistant (‘Dover’) and susceptible (‘Campinas’) to the disease in a factorial completely randomized design (CRD). Both organic mulches reduced flower blight and diseased fruit incidence by up to 76% compared to the plastic mulch treatment, especially in the early stages of the epidemics. ‘Dover’ had 70% lower incidence of flower blight than ‘Campinas’, and the effects of organic mulches were more pronounced in ‘Campinas’. A third experiment, with all three irrigation systems combined with inoculated and non-inoculated plots, estimated yield effects due to disease and irrigation system. All plots were covered with plastic mulch in a CRD with six treatments. This experiment clearly confirmed the higher flower blight and fruit rot incidences when sprinkler irrigation was used. In inoculated treatments, fruit yield was significantly reduced in tape-irrigated plots, and more so in sprinkler-irrigated plots. In drip-irrigated plots yield was reduced by only 1%. Overall, our results confirm the importance of cultural and genetic factors as valuable means of strawberry anthracnose management. Adoption of localized irrigation systems, the use of organic mulches and choice of a partially resistant cultivar significantly reduced disease levels in field plots. The importance of water splash for C. acutatum dispersal and its dependency on the soil mulch characteristics are the likely causes for the results observed.
Keywords: Colletotrichum acutatum; fruit blight; fruit rot; strawberry; Fragaria x ananassa 1. Introduction 
Anthracnose is one of the main strawberry (Fragaria 6 ananassa) diseases worldwide (Maas 1998; Peres et al. 2005), as well as in Brazil (Tanaka and Passos 2002). Several Colletotrichum species are associated with the disease, e.g. C. fragariae Brooks, C. dematium (Pers.) Grove,C. gloeosporioides Penz., andC. acutatum
Simmonds (Gunnel and Gluber 1992). Symptoms occur on fruit, buds, blossoms, petioles, runners, crowns, and foliage. However, the two most destructive forms of the disease are crown rot anthracnose, usually caused by C. fragariae and mainly associated with roots, crowns and fruit; and the flower blight and fruit rot caused by C. acutatum (Howard et al. 1992;Maas 1998).
Fruit rot and flower blight, caused by
C. acutatum, is arguably the main limiting factor for strawberry production in Brazil. The disease causes significant yield losses and is responsible for a large part of the fungicide schedule still adopted by
Brazilian growers (Henz et al. 1992; Furlanetto et al. 1996). However, fungicide applications do not always result in efficient control, and resistance to some active principles has been reported (e.g. Kososki et al. 2001; Pedroso and Café-Filho 2005). Further more, the majority of cultivars, such as Oso Grande,
Sweet Charlie and Campinas are highly susceptible to anthracnose. Cultivar Dover, relatively resistant to the disease, also may sustain high losses when the environment and management practices are condu cive to the disease (Furlanetto et al. 1996).
Conidia of Colletotrichum are produced in masses immersed in a water-soluble mucilage in reproductive structures – acervulae, the function of which is to 5 10 15 20 25 30 35 40 45 50 55 60 65 70 75 80 85 90 95 100 105 110 115 *Corresponding author.

The germination of conidia is inhibited by the mucilage, and its dissolution is necessary for germi nation (Louis et al. 1988; Leite and Nicholson 1992).
Therefore, conidial release and dispersal, and the occurrence of disease epidemics, are heavily depen dent on free water and water splash. Dispersal of
C. acutatum is favored by extended rains (Yang et al.
1990a; Madden et al. 1996), while short periods of precipitation are efficient for the short-distance dispersal among plants (Yang et al. 1990b; Madden et al. 1992, 1996).
In Brazil, strawberry is normally cultivated in the dry winter season when the crop must be irrigated.
The traditional overhead sprinkler irrigation system has been the most popular among growers, but localized systems, such as drip irrigation and low pressure tape irrigation have increasingly become more widely adopted. Localized irrigation is achieved by drip irrigation under plastic mulch or by surface low-pressure streams from plastic tapes, and it is characterized by a high efficiency of application. Drip irrigation has been recommended to improve fruit quality, but it is more expensive and requires more maintenance than surface plastic tapes.
Strawberry fields traditionally are mulched. This practice is widespread in Brazil and allows for better quality of fruit and reduces the costs associated with weed control. However, it has been demonstrated that plastic mulching also favors splash-dispersal of the conidia of Colletotrichum (Yang et al. 1990a, 1990b, 1992; Madden et al. 1993).
The effects of irrigation practices, soil cover and genetically based resistance on strawberry anthrac nose have not been studied in detail in Brazil, where economic losses due to strawberry anthracnose have been important. In addition, complete host resistance is not commercially available, fungal resistance to fungicides is known, and consumer and environmen tal concerns about fungicide use are on the rise.
Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of irrigation systems, mulching material and genetically based resistance, as well as their interactions, on the incidence of strawberry anthracnose caused byColletotrichum acutatum. 2. Materials and methods 2.1. Origin, preparation of inoculum and inoculation 
All experiments were inoculated with a mix of
C. acutatum isolates UnB-1917 and UnB-1922, both collected in commercial fields in Brazlândia, DF,
Brazil, and were previously identified as virulent by
Barros et al. (1997). Prior to the field inoculation, isolates were inoculated onto strawberry fruits and re isolated to ensure virulence. Plots were inoculated with artificially infected strawberry fruits prepared in accordance with Yang et al. (1990a, 1990b). For the first experiment, plots were infested with 35 diseased strawberry fruits placed on 30-cm diameter alumi nium trays 0.10 m above soil level in the space between beds 70 days after transplanting (DAT). For the second experiment, diseased fruits were placed on open Petri dishes with five to seven fruit per dish and five dishes per plot distributed in the centre row of each treatment at 68 DAT. For the third experiment, one focus was created in each plot by placing five diseased fruits around the most central plant of each treatment 65 DAT. Throughout the study, the identity of C. acutatum as the causal agent for the observed symptoms was confirmed by periodic pathogen isolation from symptomatic flowers and flower buds. 2.2. Effect of systems of irrigation and mulching material on the progress of strawberry anthracnose 
Effects of irrigation systems and mulching materials were first studied on cv. Campinas IAC-2712, which is susceptible to anthracnose. Three systems of irrigation were compared: (a) overhead sprinkler irrigation; (b) localized low-pressure tape irrigation; and (c) drip irrigation. Sprinkler irrigation was carried at an average outflow of 0.12 l/s, with sprinklers (West-Wa1) placed at 0.80 m above soil surface. Localized low-pressure tape irrigation system was carried out with low density, laser-perforated plastic tapes (Santape1), with perforations 0.15 m apart and outflow of 12 l/h per m. For the drip irrigated plots, two plastic drip-irrigation lines were placed between the plant rows, and emitters (Typhoom1 125) were placed 0.30 m apart. The outflow of each emitter was of 1.65 l/h. Irrigation events were conducted every 2 or 3 days, with a depth of water calculated according to Klar (1991) and corrected for the efficiency of each system (Pair et al.
1983). Soil moisture was monitored periodically with tensiometers. In order to minimize the effects of wind on the distribution of water, irrigation was always carried out in the morning, with the exception of the day of inoculation, when the irrigations were applied immediately after inoculation at sunset.
Two mulching materials were compared: (a) 0.03 mm black, non-permeable, polyethylene plastic, equivalent to the mulch adopted by most strawberry growers in Brazil, and (b) sun-dried grass mulch (Brachiaria sp.), collected in the areas next to the experiment, to a depth of ca. 4 cm. Mulches were placed onto plots 25 DAT. 
The incidence (%) of flower blight was recorded in all plants at growing radial distances from the foci.
The percent age of flowers showing symptoms of flower blight was estimated by weekly counts of the number of symptomatic flower buds and the total number of flower buds at 20, 27, 34, 41, 47 and 55 days after inoculation (DAI). Values of the areas 120 125 130 135 140 145 150 155 160 165 170 175 180 185 190 195 200 205 210 215 220 225 230 2 M.V.S. Coelho et al. under of disease progress curves (AUDPC) for each plot were calculated according to Shaner and Finney (1977). The percentage of diseased fruits was calcu lated similarly, by recording the number of mature healthy and damaged fruit. Fruits were harvested weekly, starting 72 days after transplant (DAT) when more than two-thirds of the fruit surface was red. The incidence (%) of diseased fruit was recorded at each harvest.
The experiment followed a 3 6 2 factorial in a split-plot design with four replicates. The Irrigation system was the whole-plot factor and mulching material was the sub-plot factor. Beds were 1.10 6 0.20 m, with three rows of plants, 0.35 m apart. Experimental units consisted of two parallel beds with three lines of seven plants, totalling 42 plants. The experimental plots were separated longitudinally by 0.60 m of bare soil, to reduce interplot interference. Incidence data were normal ized prior to statistical analysis and mean separation.
AUDPC values were also subjected to ANOVA and subsequent mean separation (Tukey’s multiple range test). 2.3. Effect of mulching material and partial resistance 
The single and combined effects of mulching materials and partial host resistance on the incidence of flower blight were studied under conditions of overhead sprinkler irrigation. Three mulching mate rials were compared: (a) 0.03-mm black, non-perme able, polyethylene plastic, as described, (b) sun-dried grass mulch (Brachiaria sp.), as described, and (c) sun-dried pine mulch (Pinus elliottii) collected in an area of reforestation adjacent to the experi ment, to depth of ca. 4 cm. Mulches were placed onto plots 25 DAT. 
Two cultivars, with different levels of resistance to anthracnose, were compared: (a) cv. Campinas IAC 2712 (susceptible) and (b) cv. Dover (partially resistant). Although ‘Dover’ is reported as resistant to C. acutatum (Howard et al. 1992; Denoyes-Rothan et al. 1999), resistance is not complete and high losses due to anthracnose have been reported in Brası́lia in this genotype (Furlanetto et al. 1996). Incidence of flower blight and of diseased fruits (%) was recorded weekly at 23, 29, 37 and 44 DAI. AUDPCs were also calculated as described previously.
The experiment was a 2 6 3 factorial in a split plot design with three replicates. The whole-plot factor was cultivar and the sub-plot factor was mulching material. Experimental units consisted of one bed with 18 plants distributed in three lines of six plants. The experimental plots were separated long itudinally by 0.60 m of bare soil. Disease data were compared by ANOVA and subsequent mean separa tion (Tukey’s multiple range test). 2.4. Effect of irrigation system on anthracnose incidence and strawberry fruit yield 
A third experiment was conducted to estimate the effects of the disease and irrigation systems on fruit yield. The effects of overhead sprinkler irrigation, localized low-pressure tape irrigation, and drip irrigation were compared on inoculated and non inoculated plots of cv. Campinas. All plots were covered with plastic mulch as described previously.
The experiment was a 2 6 3 factorial in a completely randomized design with six treatments and six replicates. Experimental units consisted of one bed with 21 plants, distributed in three lines of seven plants. Inoculated and non-inoculated beds were 1.0 m apart and a perpendicular plastic barrier was placed between beds to reduce interplot interference.
The following variables were recorded: (a) in cidence of flower blight; (b) incidence of diseased fruits; and (c) total fruit yield. Disease data were compared by ANOVA and subsequent mean separa tion (Tukey’s multiple range test). 3. Results 3.1. Effect of systems of irrigation and mulching material on the progress of strawberry anthracnose 
First flower blight symptoms due to C. acutatum were observed in the treatments with overhead and localized low-pressure overhead tape irrigation 20 days after the inoculation (DAI) (Figure 1a). Disease occurrence in the drip-irrigated treatment was only observed very late in the season at 47 DAI, albeit at low incidence (0.2%). In the early stages of the epidemics (20 DAI), the interaction between irriga tion systems and mulching materials was significant (P � 0.05), indicating that the magnitude of the effects of the mulches was influenced by the system of irrigation applied. The highest incidence of flower blight was found in the combination of overhead irrigation and plastic mulch material (Figure 1a).
Later in the epidemics (27–47 DAI, not shown), significant interactions between irrigation and mulching materials ceased to be observed (P 4 0.05). Lack of significant interactions between main factors allowed for separate contrasts of irrigation system and mulch type (Figure 2). Disease levels were lower in low-pressure tape-irrigated plots than in the ones irrigated by overhead sprinklers, regardless of the mulch material applied (Figure 2a,
Table 1). Similarly, disease levels in plots covered with grass mulch were lower than when plastic mulch was used (Figure 2b). At the last stages in the epidemics (55 DAI), the interaction between irriga tion systems and mulching material was significant (P � 0.01): for overhead-irrigated plots, use of plastic mulch increased the incidence of flower blight more than 3-fold, while no significant effect of 235 240 245 250 255 260 265 270 275 280 285 290 295 300 305 310 315 320 325 330 335 340 345 
International Journal of Pest Management 3 mulching material was observed for the drip irrigated or plastic tape-irrigated plots (Figure 1b).
No significant interactions between irrigation and mulching materials were found for the AUDPCs of the incidence of blighted flowers. The average
AUDPC values for drip, plastic tapes and overhead irrigation were significantly different (P � 0.01).
AUDPCs between plastic and grass mulch were similar (P 4 0.05, Table 1).
First fruit symptoms were observed 35 DAI. Diseased fruits often had orange-colored masses of spores over lesions. Analogous to the incidence of blighted flowers, the percentage of diseased fruits was significantly (P � 0.05) higher in the overhead irrigated plots (21%), followed by plastic tapes (17%) and drip irrigation (6% diseased fruit).
Incidence of diseased fruit was similar between grass and plastic mulched plots, and ranged between 14.2 and 15.1%.
While no disease gradient was observed in the plastic mulched plots, in the grass mulched plots more diseased fruit was found closer to the inoculum source, decreasing gradually with increasing distances from the inoculum (not shown). 3.2. Effect of mulching material and partial resistance 
The first symptoms of flower blight in this experiment were observed 23 DAI, when a significantly lower percentage of blighted flowers was found in the plots treated with grass mulch (Figure 3a, P � 0.05), while no effects of genetic resistance or of the interaction mulching material 6 cultivar were detected at this point in the epidemics. Twenty-nine DAI, the incidence of blighted flowers in the plots treated with plastic mulch was greater than in the plots treated with either grass or pine mulch (Figure 3b,
P 5 0.05). The effect of genetic resistance was also significant at 29 DAI (P 5 0.05). Disease incidence on cv. Campinas reached 23.3% of flowers, while ‘Dover’ reached only 7.5% blighted flowers. No interaction between mulching material and cultivar was observed at the early stages in the epidemics (23 and 29 DAI). 350 355 360 365 370 375 380 385 390 395 400 405 410 415 420 425 430 435 440 445 450 455 460

Figure 2. Disease progress curves for the single main effects of irrigation system and mulch material on the incidence of flower blight: main effects of irrigation system irrigation (above); and main effects of mulching material (below). No significant interactions were observed for the areas under disease progress curves (AUDPCs) between irrigation system and mulch material. 4 M.V.S. Coelho et al. 
Cultivar differences remained significant later in the epidemics at 37 and 44 DAI (P � 0.01), while the effect of mulching material ceased to be significant (P 4 0.05, Figure 4a). Lower percentages of blighted flowers were observed on ‘Dover’ (always below 15%), while disease incidence on ‘Campinas’ ranged between 45 and 50% (Figure 4b).
AUDPC values for the effects of genetic resistance in the incidence of flower blight were significant (P � 0.01). Cultivar ‘Campinas’ disease units were more than 3-fold those of Dover. Although the shape of the disease progress curves suggested a more rapid disease progress in plastic mulched plots (Figure 4a),
AUDPC values for mulch treatments were similar (P 4 0.05, Table 2).
Despite lower flower blight incidence, more diseased fruit was found in plots of ‘Dover’ (33%) than with ‘Campinas’ (17.4%) (Figure 5). This is probably due to the intense destruction of flowers in ‘Campinas’ early in the season, so that fewer fruits were available for infection latter. Because more flowers of cv. Dover survived earlier, more healthy fruit tissue was available for infection later in the season. Diseased fruit incidence was significantly affected by the interaction mulching material 6 cul tivar genotype (P 5 0.05). Thus, the effect of mulching material was different for each of the cultivars: while incidence of diseased fruit for ‘Dover’ was not affected by mulching material, plastic mulch increased incidence of damaged fruit for ‘Campinas’, 470 475 480 485 490 495 500 505 510 515 520 525 530 535 540 545 550 555 560 565 570 575 580

The first symptoms of flower blight were detected 14
DAI in the overhead and low-pressure irrigated treatments (not shown). In the drip-irrigated plots, only low frequencies of flower blight were observed, and disease was detected much later in the season (50
DAI). No symptoms were observed in the non inoculated control plots. During the whole extent of the epidemics, the highest percentage of infected flowers was found in the overhead-irrigated plots, followed by the plots irrigated with low-pressure tapes. Incidence of blighted flowers in overhead irrigated plots was consistently 2–5-fold greater than in tape-irrigated plots. No disease was recorded in drip-irrigated plots (Table 3).
The first fruit symptoms in this experiment were observed early in the overhead-irrigated plots (7
DAI). Contrastingly, first fruit symptoms in the drip-irrigated plots were observed only at 27 DAI. The percentage of infected mature strawberry fruits was low in drip-irrigated plots (less than 1%), intermediate in low-pressure tape-irrigated plots (3.1%), and 10-fold more in the overhead-irrigated plots (10.3%). The percentage of fruits damaged in the negative controls was lower than 1%, irrespec tive of the irrigation system (Table 3). Fruit yield was not significantly different with the drip irrigation system between inoculated and non inoculated treatments. 4. Discussion 
Incidence of flower blight caused by C. acutatum in field conditions analogous to strawberry growerś practices was strongly affected by irrigation system, type of mulch, and host genetic resistance. Flower blight and fruit rot were minimized with irrigation systems and mulching type associated with reduced water splash. Organic material, especially dried grass mulch, reduced disease levels appreciably under overhead irrigation. Organic mulches did not affect disease levels significantly under localized drip or low pressure irrigation, presumably because water splash is already reduced by these practices.

Figure 5. Effects of mulching material and partial genetic resistance on the incidence of damaged fruit. Bars with different letters are significantly different, according to
Tukey’s multiple range test (P � 0.05). 6 M.V.S. Coelho et al. proved useful in combination with a choice of a proper irrigation system and type of mulch.
The disease progress curves (Figures 2 and 4) display the separate treatment effects of each of the cultural choices (irrigation, mulch and cultivar) for strawberry flower blight. Indeed, the environmental effects of irrigation choice and mulch type and the slow-blighting effect of cultivar resistance on the disease cycle were compounded several times due to the multiple cycles of this polycyclic disease (VanderPlank 1963), resulting in slower overall disease progress and reduced final disease levels.
The overall effects of irrigation system and mulching material during the whole of the planting season were represented by the AUDPC values. This variable, which integrates the cumulative effect of each treatment-combination indicated that the irrigation system was the main driving factor in the epidemics, while choice of grass-mulch was a secondary driving factor. However, since growers do sometimes favor the use of overhead irrigation (because of mite and powdery mildew control), the importance of mulch type becomes more important. Several authors (Yang et al. 1990a, 1990b, 1992; Madden et al. 1992, 1993;
Ntahimpera et al. 1998) have noted a significant reduction in the incidence of flower blight in the treatments with grass mulch in comparison to plastic mulch, with natural or simulated precipitation. These effects occur with common irrigation practices in
Brazil; the most likely explanation is reduced dispersal of C. acutatum conidia, which is highly dependent on water splash. Indeed, while no spatial pattern analyses were performed, the observed decrease in disease levels with increasing distances from the inoculum source in the grass mulched plots, suggests there was reduced pathogen dispersal in these plots.
In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose showed that choice of host genotype, of localized irrigation, and of dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field, with synergistic effects when these practices are adopted concurrently. Contrastingly, choice of a more susceptible cultivar, adoption of overhead sprinkler irrigation and of plastic mulch favored high levels of flower blight. While our results must be interpreted with caution (given the lack of perfectly replicated trials), the effect of each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch and host genotype) was replicated in more than one experiment, which partially validates these conclu sions. Furthermore, the adoption of these cultural practices did not result in yield loss in the absence of the disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of ‘Dover’ than in plots of ‘Campinas’ due to the fact that more flowers of ‘Dover’ survived earlier in the season, so that there was more healthy tissue available for infection later on.
Finally, we would like to stress that strawberry production in Brazil remains very heavily dependent on fungicide applications, which nevertheless are not completely efficient for anthracnose control and elicit many consumer concerns about food safety. Our study shows that management of flower blight can be quite efficient with a combination of cultural choices, which will likely reduce dependency on chemical control.Acknowledgements
