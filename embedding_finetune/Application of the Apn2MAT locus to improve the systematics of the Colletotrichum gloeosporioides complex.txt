Abstract: To improve phylogenetic resolution of the
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex we developed and tested the performance of a new set of primers for the Apn2/MAT locus with a case study of 22 isolates. These were isolated mainly from coffee plants and represent six divergent and well charac terized species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Following previous studies on this locus, we have generated sequence data from an expanded region (. 4600 bp), revealing increased phylogenetic informativeness when compared to other commonly used markers such as ITS, b-tub2 and GS. Within the
Apn2/MAT locus the ApMAT marker alone was almost as informative in terms of phylogenetic resolution as a seven-gene concatenated dataset.
Our results further revealed that gene-tree discor dance may come to be a common issue in resolving evolutionary relationships in the C. gloeosporioides complex, highlighting the importance of multilocus approaches. The use of state-of-the-art data analysis techniques and a highly informative dataset as employed here may abate this issue and hopefully assist in disentangling the C. gloeosporioides complex.

Disentangling species complexes in the Colletotrichum genus will remain a considerable challenge for tax onomists in the years to come. Given the worldwide importance of this genus, mainly comprising plant pathogens, it is essential to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to improve biosecurity and disease control (Johnston and Jones 1997, Freeman et al.
1998, Cai et al. 2009). Morphological, cultural and host-preference criteria have been the primary basis for species identification and delimitation. However, due to the unreliability and limited number of those diagnostic characteristics, studies based on such criteria have led to longstanding and unresolved taxonomic issues (Cannon et al. 2000, Afanador
Kafuri et al. 2002, Du et al. 2005, Hyde et al. 2009a).
As Sutton (1992) stated, morphology alone is unlikely to provide enough information to improve systemat ics of species complexes, such as C. gloeosporioides (e.g. the graminicolous group, Du et al. 2005; the curved spore/dematium group, Damm et al. 2009).
C. gloeosporioides is regarded as the most chal lenging species complex to resolve, comprising the broadest host range of all Colletotrichum species (Du et al. 2005). Fungal strains from this complex have been reported from at least 1800 plant hosts and present such a wide range of morphological and path ogenic variation that the species name is of limited practical use (Hyde et al. 2009a). A major contribu tion for the enlargement of this complex was the revision of the genus by von Arx (1957) in which a wider spore range was established as a criterion for C. gloeosporioides identification (Sutton 1992). As a result, many Colletotrichum strains with similar cylindrical conidia were identified as C. gloeosporioides, lumping together potentially distinct taxa (Hindorf et al. 1970,
Munaut et al. 1998, Freeman et al. 2000, Chakraborty et al. 2002, Xiao et al. 2004, Hyde et al. 2009b). Since

Mycologia, 104(2), 2012, pp. 396–409. DOI: 10.3852/11-145 # 2012 by The Mycological Society of America, Lawrence, KS 66044-8897 396 the revision by Sutton (1992) until the most recent major revision of the genus (Hyde et al. 2009a) most studies on C. gloeosporioides systematics (e.g. Abang et al. 2002, Lubbe et al. 2004, Xiao et al. 2004, Suzuki et al. 2010) addressed only specific hosts, often reclassi fying isolates previously described as C. gloeosporioides into other Colletotrichum species (e.g. Gunnel and
Gubler 1992, Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1994, Ramos et al.
2006). In fact, the exceptionally broad host range of C. gloeosporiodes hampers studies addressing the entire complex.
The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides set an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the
C. gloeosporioides complex (Cannon et al. 2008). Ever since, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference basis to which isolates can be compared. However, the criteria for species delimitation have been subject of much debate throughout the years and Colletotrichum has been an example (Cannon et al. 2008). Until re cently, single-locus phylogenies dominated molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al.
1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones 1997, Nguyen et al.
2009, Polashock et al. 2009). In particular, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8 S ribosomal
RNA is the most widely sequenced region in Colleto trichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based
C. gloeosporioides-specific primers (Mills et al. 1992) have been widely used for identification of Colleto trichum fungi over the past 10–15 y. However there are serious concerns about the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al. 2009, Crouch et al.
2009b). The limitations of ITS and other similar markers are already recognized, and thus the develop ment and use of more informative loci has become increasingly necessary.
Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective method to determine species boundaries—particularly by using the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (Taylor et al. 2000)—and also to better understand species’ evolutionary relationships (Crouch et al. 2006, 2009a). The synergy of epitypification with the emergence of multilocus phylogenetic analyses provides an opportunity to unravel the species richness of the C. gloeosporioides complex. For instance studies focused on Arabica coffee plants (Coffea arabica) in Thailand and on cacao (Theobroma cacao) and other plant species in
Panama were able to identify six new species from the C. gloeosporioides complex that represented phylogenetically distinct lineages from the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides (Prihastuti et al. 2009,Rojas et al. 2010).
Here we report the development and use of several primer sets for the Apn2/MAT locus to improve systematic resolution and knowledge of the C. gloeosporioides complex, using species inhabiting
Coffea spp. As shown by Crouch et al. (2009a), sequence data from this locus allowed the successful resolution of the graminicolous Colletotrichum group.
Rojas et al. (2010) have also amplified and sequenced an orthologous region in a phylogenetic study of C. gloeosporioides s.l., further revealing its usefulness. In the present study, we have further exploited this region for primer development and assessed the usefulness of the locus compared to other commonly used nuclear genes or regions, focusing on a well characterized group of species from coffee hosts.
These included fairly divergent and well recognized species, such as the coffee berry disease (CBD) pathogen, C. kahawae, and other opportunistic pathogens characterized by Prihastuti et al. (2009) that occur on a number of other hosts as well as representatives of C. gloeosporioides s.s. We also applied a recent Bayesian data analysis technique for species tree reconstruction and compared it to the routinely used method of concatenation (Liu 2008).MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Fungal material and DNA extraction.—Colletotrichum spp.
isolates used in this study is provided (TABLE I). Nineteen isolates were obtained from the collection maintained at
CIFC/IICT (Portugal) and three from the Mae Fah Luang
University collection (Thailand), representing six previously characterized species from the C. gloeosporioides complex, namely C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. asianum, C. siamense and C. fructicola, including ex-type specimens for the three latter species. C. kahawae isolates were identified based on BLAST queries of the ITS and b-tubulin 2 (b-tub2) sequences compared to the holotype (GenBank accession numbers FJ972608 [E value 5 0, Max ident. 5 100%] and FJ907432 [E value 5 0, Max ident. 5 100%]) and on their ability to cause CBD symptoms on detached green coffee berries. The latter was shown to be the most reliable method to identify true C. kahawae isolates because recent results revealed the existence of non
C. kahawae isolates with identical genetic sequences for several nuclear markers, including ITS and b-tub2 (data not shown). The C. gloeosporioides sampling comprised isolates that are similar to the ex-epitype strain at the ITS and b-tub2 loci (GenBank accession numbers EU371022 [E value 5 0,
Max ident. 5 98%] and FJ907445 [E value 5 0, Max ident.
5 99%] respectively). Likewise, BLAST queries of the
MAT1-2-1 HMG locus enabled the identification of five iso lates as C. fragariae by comparison with the species epitype (GenBank accession number DQ002827 [E value 5 9e-87,
Max ident. 94%]). Except for isolates CR21, PT111 and
PR220 (C. gloeosporioides s.s.), which were obtained from
Citrus limon and Olea europaea (TABLE I), all other isolates

N o t se q u en ce d 398 MYCOLOGIA were obtained from Coffea spp. Isolates were revived on malt extract agar 1% with a bacterial inhibitor (KCNS, 50 mM) and grown 5–7 d. Isolates were grown in liquid media containing 3% malt extract and 0.5% Peptone 12–14 d at 25 C in the dark. DNA was extracted from freeze dried mycelia with the DNeasy plant Minikit (QIAGEN, Hilden,
Germany) according to manufacturer’s instructions.
Apn2/MAT locus marker development strategy.—A novel set of specific primers was developed to amplify a portion of the
Apn2/MAT locus (FIG. 1), using C. gloeosporioides GenBank accession AY357890 as the main template. This genomic sequence spans 11 592 bp and includes the Apn2/MAT locus, which comprises two genes, Apn2 (2244 bp) and
MAT1-2-1 (842 bp), connected by an intergenic region of 713 bp, and flanking regions. A representative sample of 10 isolates (TABLE I), comprising the six species, was used to amplify and sequence the full portion of this locus. Primers were designed with PerlPrimer 1.1.18 (Marshall 2004). The first two sets of specific primers, AM-F (59- TCATTCTACG
TATGTGCCCG-39)/AM-R (59-CCAGAAATACACCGAA
CTTGC-39) and M5L-F (59-ATCTTTGCGGTAGAGAAT
GAAGG-39)/M5L-R (59-GACCCTTCTATGAACGAGCC-39) were designed within and flanking the conserved HMG domain of MAT1-2-1 (FIG. 1). These conditions were used for PCR amplification: 3 min at 94 C followed by 30 cycles of 45 s at 94 C, 45 s at 62 C and 1 min at 72 C, with a final extension of 7 min at 72 C. The amplification products were sequenced and used as templates along with the
C. gloeosporioides accession, for further primer design. Based on these, primer pairs CM-F (59-TCTACCTCATCGACG
CTGCT-39)/CM-R (59-CATGTGGGCAAAGGATGGC-39) and A5L-F (59-CAAGCGACGAAGTATACGAG-39)/A5L-R (59-GCATCACGGGAATAACTAGG-39) were designed to amplify the remainder MAT1-2-1 gene and the 59 end of the Apn2 gene respectively (FIG. 1). PCR conditions were identical, except for the use of a 66 C annealing temperature for the CM-F/CM-R pair. With the sequences obtained from the 59 end of Apn2 used as templates, primers AEx3-F (59-CTCATCGGCACCTACAGC-39)/AEx3-R (59-CAAGATGTCTCCGAGCGTC-39) and subsequently primers A3L-F (59-TGACATGGAACGGTGAGTG-39)/A3L
R (59-TTCCAGTCCTCGACCGTCA-39) were designed to amplify the remaining portion of the Apn2 gene (FIG. 1).
Amplification reactions were performed as follows: 3 min at 94 C followed by 30 cycles with 45 s at 94 C, touchdown annealing step for 45 s starting at 62 C and decreasing 0.5 C per cycle until stabilizing at 57 C during the remaining 20 cycles, 1 min at 72 C and a final extension of 7 min at 72 C. For all PCR reactions a total of 50 ng genomic DNA was used as template in a 15 mL PCR reaction mix containing 250 mM of dNTP mix (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), 0.5–0.8 pmol each primer, 1 U DreamTaq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas) and 13 PCR buffer with 2 mM MgCl2 (MBI Fermentas). The nomenclature of the molecular markers developed is as follows (from the 39 of Apn2 onward): Apn23L, with A3L-F/A3L-R; Apn2Ex3, with
AEx3-F/AEx3-R; Apn25L, with A5L-F/A5L-R; ApMAT, with
AM-F/AM-R; MAT1-2-1 and MAT5L, with CM-F/M5L-R (FIG. 2). Sequences were deposited at GenBank under the accession numbers herein (TABLE I). 
Molecular data.—Using the complete taxa sampling of this study (TABLE I), five nuclear genes and two intergenic regions were sequenced. From the Apn2/MAT locus (FIG. 1) the two intergenic regions (ApMAT and MAT5L) as well as the MAT1-2-1 gene and the Apn25L gene fragment were selected, considering both their informative potential and sequence length. The ITS nuclear region (Brown et al. 1996) and two gene fragments from b-tub2 (O’Donnell and Cigelnik 1997) and glutamine synthetase (GS) (Prihastuti et al. 2009) were also analyzed with primers and PCR conditions previously described. PCR products were verified by electrophoresis on a 1.2% w/v agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified with SureClean (Bioline, London, UK). Sequencing reactions were carried out with the BigDye 3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems,
USA) on an ABI prism 310 automated sequencer. Ampli cons were sequenced in both directions and chromato grams were manually verified for errors in Sequencher 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan). 
Data analysis.—Datasets for each marker were aligned in
Mafft 6.717b (Katoh et al. 2009) with the L-INS-i method, followed by manual refinement in BioEdit 7.0.5.1. Using all studied loci, the nucleotide diversity (p) and its standard deviation were estimated for each selected marker in
DNasp 5 (Rozas et al. 2003). In addition, to compare the polymorphisms between and among all used markers in the representative sample, a sliding window analysis of nucleo tide diversity was performed with a window length of 50 bp and step of 25 bp. Sites with alignment gaps were not considered in the length of the windows, and all estimations were performed with the standard parameters of the program. Output graphics were produced on the R package 2.10.1 with the ggplot2 library.
For the phylogenetic analysis we adjusted the ApMAT marker sequence boundaries to separate intergenic from coding regions because these are likely to evolve according to different evolutionary models. In this way, given that both ends of the ApMAT original sequence were composed of the 39 end of the Apn2 (, 46 bp) and MAT1-2-1 genes (, 16 bp) (FIG. 1), these fragments were cut and merged with the original Apn25L and MAT1-2-1 sequences, respectively.
The phylogenetic performance of each individual marker

SILVA ET AL.: APN2/MAT IN SYSTEMATICS 399 first was assessed with the online application PhyDesign (Lopez-Giraldez and Townsend 2011), which implements an empirical metric of phylogenetic informativeness (Town send 2007). This provides a quantitative prediction of the utility and information that individual partitions contain to resolve phylogenetic questions. The required ultrametric tree was provided with the UPGMA method implemented in the program MEGA 5 (Tamura et al. 2011). Site rates for each partition were estimated with the HyPhy script, as recommended by the author. Phylogenetically informative values were calculated on a per-site basis to avoid biases from gene length and minimize the phylogenetic noise (Lopez-Giraldez and Townsend 2011).
To create concatenated matrices from the individual datasets the Concatenator 1.1.0 software was used (Pina
Martins and Paulo 2008). Three molecular marker combi nations were assembled for subsequent comparative pur poses and designated as: Apn-MAT dataset, comprising only
Apn2/MAT locus makers, except MAT1-2-1; traditional dataset, combining ITS, b-tub2 and GS; and the total concatenated dataset. MAT1-2-1 was not included in the
Apn-MAT dataset to balance the sequence length of both
Apn-MAT and traditional datasets, providing a more even comparison. Five C. fragariae isolates were used as outgroup taxa to root phylogenetic trees (Cai et al. 2009). Additional outgroup taxa could not be considered because ortholo gous regions to all our developed markers were unavailable in public databases, with the exception of C. graminicola whose sequences were too divergent for accurate and reliable alignments. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the individual and combined analyses of the seven nuclear regions with maximum likelihood (ML) and a Bayesian framework with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) algorithm. Gaps were treated as missing data. The ML analysis was run in PAUP* 4.0d99 (Swofford 2003) with heuristic searches of 100 replicates with random sequence addition and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm. Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted with 1000 pseudoreplicates with 10 random additions and TBR branch swapping. ModelTest 3.7 (Posada and Crandall 1998) was used to select the best fit model of nucleotide evolution under the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each dataset. The BMCMC analysis was run in MrBayes 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003) with the optimal model selected under the AIC, as implemented in MrModelTest 2.3 (Nylander 2004), specified as prior for each partition. For the individual and combined datasets, Bayesian posterior prob abilities were generated from 3 3 107 and 1 3 108 generations respectively, sampling every 1000th generation. The analysis was run three times with one cold and three incrementally heated Metropolis-coupled Monte Carlo Markov chains, starting from random trees. A total of 1 3 106 generations were discarded as burn-in. Trees were combined and summarized on a 50% majority rule consensus tree.
FIG. 2. Sliding window analysis of the nucleotide diversity (p) estimated from the molecular markers used, based on a 10 isolate representative sample. The window length is 50 bp and the step size is 25 bp. For the Apn2/MAT locus, below the sliding window plot, a schematic representation of gene and intergenic segments along their length is presented. In the
Apn2/MAT locus plot the vertical dot lines represent the molecular markers’ boundaries. Graphics were produced and adapted from DNasp 5 estimates with the R statistics package. 400 MYCOLOGIA 
The total combined dataset also was analyzed with the species-tree approach implemented in BEST (Liu 2008) to incorporate the signals of each marker. BEST has been shown to deal with the common issue of deep coalescence in recently diverged species. It uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate the joint posterior distribution of multiple gene trees and is known to provide more accurate estimates than the concatenation method in some multi locus datasets (Edwards et al. 2007, Liu and Pearl 2007).
The BEST analysis was run in MrBayes 2.3, and model priors for each partition were estimated as in the BMCMC analysis.
Priors included an inverse gamma distribution (3, 0.003) for theta and a uniform distribution (0.2, 2) for gene mutation and were estimated as part of the analysis. A total of 2.5 3 109 generations were sampled every 2000 generations.
Convergence and mixing were assessed for all parameters with Tracer 1.4 (Drummond and Rambaut 2007). The species tree was constructed from the combined runs.
Topology tests.—The current taxonomic relationship of the studied species also was assessed through topology tests on each relevant dataset. Alternative hypothesis were tested against the most recent hypothesis of relationships between our species of interest (Phoulivong et al. 2010) with the topological test of Shimodaira and Hasegawa (SH) (Shimo daira and Hasegawa 1999) as implemented in PAUP* 4.0d99 (Swofford 2003). Although this current taxonomy was not formally addressed, it provided an objective starting point for our analysis. First we tested the unconstrained phylogenies of each dataset that revealed discordant phylogenies to assess whether their branching order was significantly incongruent with the current taxonomy. In addition because C. siamense received only moderate support in the current taxonomy we also tested the alternative hypothesis of its monophyly to the second closest taxa, C. asianum (i.e. {[C. siamense, C. asianum],
C. fructicola}, instead of the current taxonomy {[C. siamense,
C. fructicola}, C. asianum]) for congruent datasets. One thousand replicates were performed by resampling the partial likelihoods for each site (RELL model).RESULTS 
Molecular marker analysis.—The newly developed set of primers allowed the amplification of , 4061 bp from the Apn2/MAT locus. Each primer pair pro duced partially overlapping fragments that in combi nation spanned all but the first 21 codons of Apn2, the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1, the complete MAT1-2-1 gene and a small intergenic region adjacent to the 39 end of MAT1-2-1 (FIG. 1).
As in previous Colletotrichum studies, only one mating type (MAT) locus idiomorph, MAT1-2-1, was identi fied. Clean bands were reproducibly amplified by PCR for all the isolates using all primer sets, generating amplicons of , 740 bp for Apn23L, , 760 bp for
Apn2Ex3, , 840 bp for Apn25L, , 910 bp for
ApMAT and , 1040 bp for MAT1-2-1 and MAT5L. An overview of the Apn2/MAT locus map is included herein (FIG. 2), along with the position and length of each developed marker, excluding overlapping seg ments. The ITS, b-tub2 and GS markers generated products of the expected size.
The complete set of markers was first sequenced for a representative sample of 10 isolates comprising the five studied species (C. kahawae, C. gloeosporioides, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. siamense) plus the outgroup (C. fragariae). This preliminary dataset was subjected to a sliding window analysis to quantify nucleotide polymorphisms along the sequence of each marker and to provide a comparative exploratory analysis between markers (FIG. 2). The commonly used ITS region had the lowest overall nucleotide diversity (p 5 0.0077) because it was mostly invariable. The intron rich b-tub2 (p 5 0.0436) and GS (p 5 0.0433) gene fragments presented a greater degree of nucleotide variation but still revealed regions of low polymor phism. The greatest nucleotide diversity was provided by the Apn2/MAT locus because even the most conserved region of this locus, Apn2Ex3, was more polymorphic (p 5 0.0467) than b-tub2 and GS. The
ApMAT intergenic region showed the highest nucle otide diversity (p 5 0.1282), exceeding by more than twofold the diversity of b-tub2 or GS fragments. The
MAT1-2-1 gene (p 5 0.0512) showed a considerable diversity in its introns (p 5 0.1135), particularly the second one in the HMG region, in contrast with exon sequences (p 5 0.0419). In the Apn2 gene the nucleotide diversity was highest in the Apn23L marker region (p 5 0.0739) due to the presence of two introns. The Apn25L region (p 5 0.0559) also showed a considerable diversity, particularly along the exon sequence.
Based on this assessment, two gene fragments (Apn25L and MAT1-2-1) plus two intergenic regions (ApMAT and MAT5L) were selected for the multi locus phylogenetic analyses. A total of 22 sequences were obtained for each of the seven nuclear markers (ITS, b-tub2, GS, ApMAT, Apn25L, MAT1-2-1,
MAT5L), producing , 4676 bp of sequence data for each studied isolate. According to the output of the
PhyDesign web application, the index of phylogenetic power per base pair of each dataset varied widely, but all of our developed primers generated sequences with a superior resolution power throughout the phy logeny (FIG. 3). After visual inspection, the ApMAT sequence is predicted to be the most informative, followed by MAT5L, Apn25L, MAT1-2-1, GS and b-tub2, whose differences in phylogenetic informa tiveness were less evident. The ITS sequence had the lowest predicted resolution power. All of the newly developed markers revealed more information than the traditional markers, as determined with parsimo ny and nucleotide diversity statistics as comparative 
SILVA ET AL.: APN2/MAT IN SYSTEMATICS 401 benchmarks (TABLE II). ApMAT, Apn25L, MAT5L and MAT1-2-1 were 35%, 19%, 20% and 17% parsimony informative, compared with 3%, 13% and 16% for ITS, b-tub2 and GS, respectively (TABLE II). Regarding the combined datasets, even excluding
MAT1-2-1 to balance the sequence length of the two partially concatenated datasets, the Apn-MAT dataset exhibited 478 parsimony informative characters from a total of 1886 (25%), while the traditional markers contributed with only 232 parsimony informative characters from a total of 1965 (12%) (TABLE II). Altogether the total concatenated dataset presented 801 (17%) parsimony informative nucleotide charac ters with parsimony criteria.
Phylogenetic analysis.—We first constructed phyloge nies from each of the individual markers (FIG. 4). The
ML and BMCMC analyses always resulted in identical topologies for each dataset, although not all gene trees had the same resolution. For example, ITS and
MAT5L provided such poorly resolved trees that no discernible topology could be recovered and thus were not analyzed individually (data not shown). In contrast, ApMAT provided the best resolving ability in which all species/group and even some intragroup nodes were distinguishable with high support in both analyses (FIG. 4a).
Most C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates clustered with the ex-type strains of C. siamense and C. fructicola (TABLE I, FIG. 4). Generally species/groups were reciprocally monophyletic, although with varying degrees of support. An exception was the GS gene tree in which two isolates from the C. siamense group were part of a monophyletic group with C. fructicola.
However further incongruities were found when comparing the relative taxonomic position of the ingroup species. Excluding C. kahawae, which was consistently revealed as the most basal lineage, all other species showed different taxonomic relation ships in each of the independent loci analyzed due to significant gene-tree discordance. For example C. siamense was found to be part of the same monophy letic group with either C. asianum (FIG. 4a; bootstrap: 97, posterior probability [PP]: 1.00) or C. fructicola (FIG. 4d; bootstrap: 78, PP: 0.99). In the GS gene tree, although there was little support for the reciprocal monophyly of C. siamense isolates, the best ML and
BMCMC trees supported a close relationship with C. fructicola rather than with C. asianum. The second most basal lineage identified also was subject of discordance because it was either C. gloeosporioides (FIG. 4a–d; bootstrap: 82–99; PP: 0.80–1.00) or C. asianum (FIG. 4e; bootstrap: 84; PP: 0.98). As it was clearly shown, these discordances among loci were well supported by both bootstrap and posterior probability values in each loci dataset and conse quently, the phylogenetic relationships of all but one of our species were not obvious based on the topologies of gene trees alone.
Phylogenetic reconstructions were carried out for the three combined datasets to assess how these discordances affected species relationships and their node support in multilocus datasets and to compare degrees of resolution. Overall, both the traditional and
Apn-MAT datasets provided almost completely re solved and highly supported trees but presented two different topologies in which C. siamense was again either reciprocally monophyletic with C. asianum (FIG. 5a; bootstrap: 95; PP: 1.00) or C. fructicola (FIG. 5b; bootstrap: 78; PP: 1.00). When all markers

Species-tree approach and topology tests.—The current taxonomic and evolutionary relationships of the included species from the C. gloeosporioides complex were further assessed by two statistical methods. First, the species-tree approach of the BEST software was carried out because it has the useful property of accounting for discrepancies between gene trees and uses the coalescent theory to combine those gene trees to infer a species tree. The obtained tree shared the same topology as the Apn-MAT and total concatenated datasets, albeit with a much smaller support for the reciprocal monophyly between
C. siamense and C. asianum (FIG. 6). Nonetheless the remaining relationships were highly supported.
For the topological tests we assumed the null hypothesis of the most recently reported species relationship (Phoulivong et al. 2010), which is identical to that exhibited by the traditional dataset (SH test, TABLE III). Except for b-tub2, all individual datasets were discordant, but only the branching

P 5 0.035 and P 5 0.000 respectively). Likewise, the combined Apn-MAT topology was significantly differ ent (SH test, P 5 0.000) but the deviation of the total combined dataset was only marginally significant (SH test, P 5 0.076). We also tested whether the traditional dataset presented a significant deviation from the alternative scenario in which the true species relationship is similar to that recovered in the total dataset. Indeed, when the topology for this alternative scenario was constrained, it was not significantly different from the unconstrained phylogeny (SH test,P 5 0.143).DISCUSSION 
Resolving species complexes in Colletotrichum, par ticularly the C. gloeosporioides complex, is a de manding quest in which molecular systematic tools are becoming of the utmost importance for taxono mists. However, genomic regions are not equally informative and thus it is important to select the most useful loci to address this issue. The MAT locus has been employed with great success in phylogenetic studies of Colletotrichum (Du et al. 2005; Crouch et al.
2006, 2009a; Rojas et al. 2010) as well as in other genera, such as Cochliobolus (Turgeon 1998), Fusar ium (O’Donnell et al. 2004) and Leptosphaeria (Voigt et al. 2005). In our work a newly developed set of primers enabled the analysis of an expanded region of the Apn2/MAT locus in relation to other studies exploring this locus (Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al.
2009a, Rojas et al. 2010). In fact, our primer sets were able to generate not only orthologous sequences to those already published (e.g. the 39 end of the Apn2 gene and intergenic region between MAT1-2-1 [Crouch et al. 2009a, Rojas et al. 2010] or the intron in the HMG region of the MAT1-2-1 gene [Du et al.
2005]) but also the remainder of the Apn2 gene sequence as well as the complete MAT1-2-1 gene

Overall, our analyses further demonstrated the potential of this genomic region to provide an outstanding im provement in phylogenetic informativeness to face the taxonomic challenges of the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Even though our analyses focused mostly on Coffea spp.-inhabiting species of the C. gloeosporioides com plex, this sampling strategy proved valuable under the current taxonomic knowledge. First, the six species used in our study encompass relatively divergent lineages within the complex (4.5–10.1% sequence divergence). Therefore, despite probably not covering all of the putatively high species richness of the complex, they provide a wide range of sequence diversity, which is useful to assess the robustness of the developed primers and also enhances their potential applicability to other species in the C. gloeosporioides complex. Second, unlike the myriad undescribed and poorly known lineages in this complex, the species used here are well characterized and recognized by multilocus phylogenetic and mor phological studies, which is paramount when investi gating the value of the newly developed molecular tools for systematic purposes. Third, all these species were already used simultaneously in previous and independent phylogenetic studies, providing an ob jective starting point of their taxonomic relationships and allowing a much more meaningful comparison of the traditional gene-tree concatenation and the recent species-tree reconstruction methods.
Regarding their informative potential, all newly developed primer pairs generated sequences that were superior to ITS and to the two commonly used gene fragments, b-tub2 and GS, even though the latter had been useful and regarded as fairly informative (Talhinhas et al. 2005, Prihastuti et al.
2009, Rojas et al. 2010). The ITS sequence in particular, which is considered one of the most promising regions for fungal barcoding (Seifert 2009), performed poorly in our benchmark compar isons, being unable to distinguish taxonomic groups and recover their relationships. This also has been observed in other studies (Cai et al. 2009, Crouch et al. 2009b, Yang et al. 2009). As evidenced by the sliding window analysis of polymorphism and parsi mony statistics, the intergenic region between the
Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes was revealed to be the most variable segment and thus a promising marker for both taxonomic and population genetic studies in the complex. Intergenic regions are expected to be much more variable because they generally are not under functional constraints or any direct selective pressures (O’Donnell et al. 2004, Thomson et al.
2010), but for the same reason they are unsuitable regions for primer design over a broad range of species. However, the ApMAT intergenic segment is flanked by fairly conserved regions for which primers can be designed, making it an ideal marker for the
C. gloeosporioides complex. To a lesser extent, both the introns from MAT1-2-1 gene and the two Apn2 gene extremities were variable and should also prove useful for systematic purposes, as reported in other
Colletotrichum studies (Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al.
2006, 2009a; Rojas et al. 2010). Nevertheless, these markers are not barcode candidates, and attempts to use them outside the range of the C. gloeosporioides complex probably will fail due to their highly variable nature even in priming sites. For example, the markers developed by Crouch et al. (2009a) to amplify partial fragments of the Apn2 gene and intergenic region in the same locus for the gramini colous Colletotrichum species could not be used in the isolates analyzed in this study (data not shown). In fact, after obtaining the homologous sequences from isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex alignments revealed a high divergence between the two groups of species. However, these markers are much more suitable than barcode genes to accurately dissect and unravel the diversity and evolutionary relation ships in a complex of closely related species.
Moreover, as Cai et al. (2009) stated, the selection and decision of the most suitable barcode gene(s) can be made only in the process of species delimitation because only then we know which taxa need to be distinguished. In other words, we first need to fully resolve the C. gloeosporioides complex with a set of highly informative genes to adequately search and select a barcode gene.
In agreement with other studies in Colletotrichum, our study revealed the ubiquitous presence of only one MAT gene idiomorph, MAT1-2-1 (Vaillancourt et al. 2000, Chen et al. 2002, Rodrı́guez-Guerra et al.
FIG. 6. Species tree of C. gloeosporioides complex inferred with the BEST software for the total combined dataset and rooted with C. fragariae. Values above branches indicate posterior probability support.
SILVA ET AL.: APN2/MAT IN SYSTEMATICS 405 2005, Garcı́a-Serrano et al. 2008). In the fungal king dom MAT idiomorphs are known to code for trans cription factors that regulate sexual development and recognition (Kronstad and Staben 1997). However their configuration in Colletotrichum species seems to deviate from the great majority of the ascomycetes, where a single MAT locus (MAT1) exists as two al ternate idiomorphs (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2) (Turgeon 1998). Thus the exclusive presence of a MAT1-2 homolog in all species included in this work supports the idea that the genetic control underlying sexual reproduction in this genus does not conform to any known system in the entire fungal kingdom (Rodrı́guez
Guerra et al. 2005, Crouch and Beirn 2009).
In our phylogenetic analyses of the individual gene trees the ApMAT marker was singular in its ability to resolve species and even intraspecific relationships.
Alone it provided essentially the same information and support as the concatenated tree of seven genes, a feat that was not achieved by any other single marker. The other markers had variable degrees of resolution and support, ranging from low to moder ate, as is normally expected for nuclear gene markers when addressing recently diverged taxa (Thomson et al. 2010).
However, gene trees are only single realizations of the true species tree and they may not reflect the actual pattern of lineage splitting and divergence due to coalescent stochasticity (Degnan and Rosenberg 2009, Carstens and Dewey 2010). Therefore, it is useful to reconstruct individual gene trees to provide an overview of how each marker depicts species relationships. In this way, several incongruities were revealed by comparing the topology of each gene tree. For example, two isolates that were consistently shown to cluster with the C. siamense group (Mal5 and CCM5) were monophyletic with isolates from the
C. fructicola group in the GS gene tree. Moreover, each analyzed locus provided with strong support a discordant species branching order with each other and the correct relationship of the studied Colleto trichum species was not clear. In fact only one gene tree (b-tub2) was congruent with the current taxo nomic understanding of the sampled species whereas the ApMAT and MAT1-2-1 gene trees revealed a significantly deviated phylogenetic signal. Even when different combinations of genes are concatenated these discordances remain significant, as evidenced by the ambiguous relationship of C. siamense, C. fructicola and C. asianum between the traditional and
Apn-MAT datasets. There are several causes for discordance between gene trees in phylogenetic studies, including horizontal gene transfer (Anders son 2005), hybridization (Meng and Kubatko 2009) or incomplete lineage sorting (Degnan and 
Rosenberg 2009). To our knowledge this is the first report of gene-tree discordance among species of theC. gloeosporioides complex.
In this study, even though the total concatenated dataset provided a single resolved topology congruent with that of the combined Apn-MAT and individual
ApMAT datasets, the concatenation method assump tion of no heterogeneity between the embedded gene trees was violated. In addition, the longer and more informative markers, such as those from the Apn2/
MAT locus, may bias tree topology toward themselves simply because their phylogenetic signal overwhelms the information contained in less informative markers (Knowles and Carstens 2007). Because the evolution ary history of species is widely considered to be mostly a stochastic process (Kingman 1982) we have applied a recent statistical framework that accounts for the discrepancies of gene trees from multiple unlinked loci and is specifically conceived to estimate the species tree. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, the
BEST program is able not only to accommodate gene trees heterogeneity but also to retrieve useful infor mation from it and provide a more accurate estimate of the true species tree (Edwards et al. 2007). The resultant species-tree topology supported that of the total concatenated dataset, except for the C. siamense and C. asianum relationships. Although all other nodes were highly supported, there was little support for the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense and C. asianum and the relationship of these two species plus C. fructicola was unresolved. This result was obtained in spite of using the large and highly informative sequence data of our analysis. Nonethe less, it is expected that the problems and difficulties derived from incomplete lineage sorting increase as the time since species divergence decreases (Degnan and Rosenberg 2009). Thus it seems likely that these species diverged recently and consequently their relationships may still not be easily resolved. None theless, to further understand the processes that promote speciation and the evolution of phenotypic traits it will be essential to recognize and delimit nascent evolutionary lineages (Wiens 2007). In addition, it will be interesting to assess the effects of using different outgroup taxa in the phylogenetic inference as the current taxonomic knowledge of
Colletotrichum increases and molecular tools improve.
Altogether this study demonstrates the consider able improvement that the Apn2/MAT locus may provide to the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex. We report the development and application of a novel set of primers as valuable, promising tools to generate sequence data able to dissect species and even population relationships.
Indeed, based on our data, an alternative view of the 406 MYCOLOGIA evolutionary relationships of the studied species is hypothesized. Because we also showed that gene tree discordance may be a problem in recently diverged species of this complex we stress the fact that highly variable markers, such as the ApMAT, are much more likely to surpass those problems and successfully dis cern how species are phylogenetically related. It is hoped that this contribution may assist and stimulate further research on this challenging complex and eventually lead to a more comprehensive under standing of its structure, evolution and diversity.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
