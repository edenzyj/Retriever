Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, University of California, Riverside Abstract 
Anthracnose crown rot of strawberry, caused by Colletotrichum acuta tum, is an important disease affecting California nursery and fruit produc tion. Preplant dip treatments of transplants with fludioxonil-cyprodinil or azoxystrobin are industry standards for managing the disease and have been used extensively. Following reports of reduced efficacy of azoxy strobin in the field, high levels of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resis tance were detected in California isolates of the pathogen. Resistance was associated with the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene, sim ilar to a previous report from Florida, and there were no detected fitness penalties in pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, several alternative fungicides were investigated in laboratory and field studies. Subse quently, the new biofungicide natamycin was identified. Baseline sensi tivities of 74 isolates of C. acutatum to natamycin were determined to be unimodal, with a range from 0.526 to 1.996 mg/ml (mean 0.973 mg/ml).
Although this toxicity was considerably lower than that of azoxystrobin (using sensitive isolates), fludioxonil, or cyprodinil, dip treatments of transplants with natamycin (at 500 or 1000 mg/liter) were highly effec tive. Disease severity and plant mortality in field studies with inoculated transplants were reduced to similarly low levels as treatments containing fludioxonil, whereas azoxystrobin failed in inoculations with QoI-resistant isolates ofC. acutatum. Fruit yieldwas also significantly increased by nata mycin as compared with the inoculated control. Differences in disease sus ceptibility were observed among cultivars evaluated, with Monterey and
Portola more susceptible than Fronteras. Natamycin has a unique mode of action that is different from other fungicides registered on strawberry and, based on this research, was registered in the United States as a preplant, biofungicide dip treatment of strawberry transplants for management of anthracnose crown rot.
Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria × ana nassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016).
All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in signif icant yield loss from any of the different phases of the disease, includ ing crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992;
Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are asso ciated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae
A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, and
C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds most commonly causing foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and
Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most com mon causal agent for all above- and belowground phases of the dis ease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently,
C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).
Salmon- to orange-colored conidial masses are produced by 
C. acutatum in acervuli on infected tissues at high humidity. They are spread short distances by water splash from overhead sprinkler irrigation or rainfall, and long distances by infected plant material, soil associated with transplants, or contaminated equipment (Debode et al. 2015; Eastburn and Gubler 1990; Howard et al. 1992). The pathogen can survive in infected plant debris and soil for at least 9 months in the absence of a host (Eastburn and Gubler 1990;
Freeman et al. 2002). In fields that have been fumigated, disease out breaks are attributed to planting of infected nursery stock. Trans plants that appear healthy may have quiescent infections that are activated once conditions are favorable (Debode et al. 2015; Horn and Carver 1968; Leandro et al. 2001), typically under warm, wet en vironments (King et al. 1997). Crown infections can cause the entire plant to wilt and die during early establishment of fruit production fields where overhead irrigation is common (Eastburn and Gubler 1990). Ma jor anthracnose crown rot outbreaks occurred in California nurseries during the 2000–01 (Daugovish et al. 2009) and 2015–16 (K. Ivors, un published) seasons, resulting in high economic losses.
For anthracnose crown rot management, water wash or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been used in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al.
2009; Freeman et al. 1997). Running water removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially removing inoculum, but does not control any infections already present (Koike et al. 2008). Preplant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot but only two products are currently registered for this use in the
United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhib itor (QoI) azoxystrobin has been used extensively as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for management of anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al. 2002; Koike et al. 2008; Turechek et al. 2006). Resistance, however, has been reported against this fun gicide group in C. acutatum populations from strawberry in Florida (Forcelini et al. 2016). During the 2015–16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixture product of the anilinopyrimidine cypro dinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered but phyto toxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under some environmental conditions or following off-label plant exposure †Corresponding author: J.

In addition to chemical treat ments, heat treatment of transplants may reduce mortality from an thracnose but this practice is not widely used because it can reduce plant vigor (Freeman at al. 1997). In-season fungicide spray applica tions are common to prevent foliar and fruit infections (Koike et al.
2008; MacKenzie and Peres 2012) but these are ineffective against crown rot and root necrosis (Daugovish et al. 2009).
Natamycin, also known as pimaricin, is a natural polyene macro lide derived from fermentation of Streptomyces spp. (i.e., Streptomyces natalensis, S. chattanoogensis, S. gilvosporeus, and S. lydicus), and has been used as an antifungal additive in the food industry since the 1960s (Aparicio et al. 2016; Lu et al. 2008). Currently, it is reg istered in the United States as a biopesticide on mushroom beds and, recently, as a postharvest treatment on stone fruit and citrus.
Because of its unique mode of action and because resistance has never been reported in filamentous fungi during extensive use in the food industry (Aparicio et al. 2016), this fungicide could be valuable in strawberry production where QoI resistance has been reported in C. acutatum and new rotational products are needed for dip treatments.
The purpose of this research was to evaluate new fungicides with registration potential for use as preplant dip treatments of bareroot strawberry transplants for the management of anthracnose crown rot. The specific objectives were to (i) determine whether QoI resistance is present in C. acutatum populations in California and confirm with molecular tools; (ii) establish in vitro sensitivity ranges of effective concentration to inhibit mycelial growth or co nidial germination by 50% (EC50) values for selected new fungi cides for QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates of C. acutatum; (iii) evaluate the efficacy of fungicide dip treatments on disease sever ity, plant mortality, and fruit yield; and (iv) evaluate susceptibility of selected cultivars to disease.Materials and Methods
Fungal isolates and culture methods. Seventy-four isolates of 
C. acutatumwere obtained in 2015 and 2016 from commercial straw berry fields in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura, Santa
Cruz, Stanislaus, Tehama, San Joaquin, and Merced Counties of
California (Table 1). The transplant materials used to establish these fields were originally sourced from five independent nursery companies that have operations throughout the state (Table 1).
Crowns and petioles of symptomatic plants were sectioned into small pieces (10 mm3) using a scalpel, surface disinfested in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 min, triple-rinsed with sterile distilled water, and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) acidified with 1 ml of 85% lactic acid per liter (APDA). Isolates were obtained from fruit lesions by touching a sterile cotton swab onto the le sion and then streaking the swab onto the surface of APDA plates.

Colonies with morphological characteristics of Colletotrichum spp. were subcultured onto PDA and examined microscopically.
Colonies of C. acutatum were differentiated from other species of Colletotrichum by conidial morphology (Adaskaveg and Hartin 1997; Smith and Black 1990), and a subset of 26 isolates (Table 1) was confirmed to belong to the C. acutatum species complex us ing CaInt-1 and CaInt-2 primers targeting the internal transcribed spacer region of ribosomal DNA (Adaskaveg and Hartin 1997;
Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996). Cultures were stored in liquid nitro gen, and working stocks were kept as PDA plugs in sterile water at 12°C. For conidial production, a mycelial suspension was pre pared from 4- to 7-day-old PDA cultures, spread onto new PDA plates, and allowed to air dry; then, 5 to 10 1.5-cm-long auto claved strawberry petiole pieces were randomly placed onto the agar surface. Orange conidial sporulation was present after 3 to 4 days of incubation at 25°C and was used for inoculations or in vitro assays within 4 weeks.
Fungicides. Formulated products of natamycin (DelvoCid Instant; 
DSM, Heerlen, The Netherlands), azoxystrobin (Abound Flowable;
Syngenta Crop Protection Inc., Greensboro, NC), chlorothalonil (Bravo Weather Stick; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.), cyprodinil (Vangard 75WG; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.), fludioxonil (Scholar 50WP; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.), and pydiflumetofen (experimental product A19649B; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.) were used for in vitro sensitivity studies (Fig. 1). For treatment of plants, these products were used by themselves or in premixtures of fludioxonil and cyprodinil (SwitchWG; Syngenta Crop Protection
Inc.) or of pydiflumetofen and fludioxonil (experimental product
A20560C; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.) (Fig. 2). Additionally, the biological control S. lydicus WYEC 108 (minimum of 103 
CFU/g of formulated product; Actinovate AG; Valent U.S.A. LLC,
Walnut Creek, CA) was included in field trials. Aqueous solutions were used in all studies.
Evaluation of in vitro sensitivity of fungicides. Fungicide sensi tivities for all isolates of C. acutatum were determined using the spiral gradient dilution method (Förster et al. 2004). Briefly, an ex ponential concentration gradient for each fungicide was obtained by depositing appropriate stock concentrations radially onto 15-cm
PDA plates using a spiral plater (Autoplate 4000; Spiral Biotech,
Inc., Norwood, MA). For azoxystrobin, PDA was amended with sal icylhydroxamic acid at 100 mg/ml. Stock concentrations were 1,000 mg/ml for natamycin, 100 or 5,000 mg/ml for azoxystrobin, 200 mg/ml for chlorothalonil, 50 mg/ml for cyprodinil, 20 mg/ml for fludioxonil, and 10,000 mg/ml for pydiflumetofen. Sterile water was applied to control plates. After 2 to 4 h, 10 ml of each conidial suspension (5 × 105 spores/ml) was streaked radially from the outer edge toward the center of the plate using a sterile pestle. Each isolate was replicated on opposite sides of the plate, and four isolates were evaluated on each plate. Plates were incubated in the dark for 20 h at 20°C for evaluation of conidial germination (azoxystrobin only) or

Molecular characterization of QoI resistance inC. acutatum.A subset of 5 QoI-sensitive and 11 QoI-resistant C. acutatum isolates (Table 1) were grown for 7 to 10 days on PDA. DNA was extracted from mycelia using the MPBio FastDNA kit (MPBio, Santa Ana,
CA). Polymerase chain reaction amplification was done using pri mers C.gramcytb-bf1 and C.gramcytb-br1 targeting the cytochrome b gene (cytb), according to Forcelini et al. (2016). Product ampli fication was confirmed by agarose (1%) gel electrophoresis in 0.5×
Tris-borate-EDTA buffer. Amplicons were purified using ExoSap
IT (Affymetrix Inc., Santa Clara, CA) and sequenced at the Core
Instrumentation Facility of the University of California Riverside Insti tute for Integrative Genome Biology. Sequences were aligned using the BioEdit software (www.mbio.ncsu.edu/BioEdit/bioedit.html).
Effect of preplant dip treatments on disease severity and plantmortality.Two trials were conducted using Portola and Fronteras (trial 1) or Monterey and Fronteras (trial 2) strawberry cultivars.
Bareroot transplants were obtained from two nurseries and dipped for 4minwith agitation in aqueous conidial suspensions (106 conidia/ml) of a mixture of four each of QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates of
C. acutatum (Table 1). Plants were stored at 20°C for 8 h to allow conidia to germinate and infect, and then up to 3 days at 5°C. Plants were then dipped in aqueous fungicide solutions for 4 min with ag itation. Inoculated control plants were dipped in water or were left untreated. Excess solution was allowed to drain for approximately 2 min, and transplants were stored in plastic bags at 5°C overnight.
Planting in the field was done on 4 March 2016 (trial 1), and 29 Oc tober 2016 (trial 2), at the University of California Riverside Agri cultural Operations facility. The field area had been fallow for over 1 year, and had not been planted with strawberry previously. No fumigation treatment was applied prior to planting. Plants were spaced 30 cm apart in double-row beds in a randomized complete block design. Each bed represented a block (replication) of plots, and there were four blocks each for plants inoculated with QoI sensitive or -resistant isolates in each study. Each replication of treatments consisted of a plot of 10 plants of each cultivar.

Bar height represents the number of isolates within each bin, and bin widths were calculated using Scott’s method (Scott 1979). For determination of bin width for azoxystrobin evaluations, only sensitive isolate values were considered.

Overhead irrigation was applied 3 days each week for 30 min each in the morning and afternoon for the first month, and drip irrigation was applied for 2 days each week for 2 h throughout the study. Fer tilizer was applied through drip irrigation weekly or biweekly. No foliar fungicide or insecticide applications were made.
Plants were evaluated periodically for disease. Fungal isolations were done from diseased tissues of 15 randomly selected, symptom atic plants each that were inoculated with QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates to validate that C. acutatum was the causal agent. Isolations from crown, leaf, and fruit tissues were done as described above, ex cept that tissues were plated onto PDA amended with ampicillin (130 mg/ml) and rifampicin (20 mg/ml). Plants in the field were evaluated after 5 (trial 1) or 14 (trial 2) weeks for disease severity on aboveground growth using the following scale: 0 = healthy, vigorous plant; 1 = growth reduced; 2 = growth and vigor reduced, less than 50% the size of healthy plants; 3 = growth and vigor extremely reduced, less than 25% the size of healthy plants, and 4 = plant dead. Severity ratings were averaged for each 10-plant replication. The incidence of plant mortality was based on the number of dead plants (rating = 4) of the 10 plants of each cultivar in each replication.
Effect of preplant dip treatments on fruit yield. Crop yield was determined using Fronteras. In trial 1, a single harvest of all mature red, commercially acceptable fruit for each treatment replication was conducted 10 weeks after planting, and fruit were weighed. In trial 2, flowers and immature fruit were removed 7 and 12 weeks after planting, similar to commercial practices to encourage vegetative growth during thewinter period.Allmature red, commercially acceptable fruit were harvested 20 and 23 weeks after planting, and fruit weights were combined for the two harvests for each treatment replication.
Statistical analysis. For in vitro fungicide toxicity experiments, variances were homogeneous for the two experiments according to
Bartlett’s test, and data were combined for each isolate–fungicide combination. This data set was used to determine mean values and

Plants were evaluated after 5 or 14 weeks for aboveground vegetative growth based on a rating scale of 0 = healthy, vigorous plant; 1 = growth reduced; 2 = growth and vigor reduced; 3 = growth and vigor extremely reduced; and 4 = dead. Average disease severity was determined based on 10 plants for each of four replications in each experiment. Bars followed by the same letter within a graph are not significantly different based on least significant difference mean separation (P > 0.05) procedures.

Data for incidence of mortality were arcsin-transformed, whereas yield data were transformed using y = log10(x + 1) prior to statistical analysis for both trials. All data for disease severity, incidence of mortality, and yield were normally distributed according to Shapiro
Wilk’s test. Data were combined from different experiments when variances were homogeneous according to Bartlett’s test. Analyses of variance or generalized linear model procedures were performed following a factorial design with cultivar, inoculum type, and fun gicide treatment as the main factors. When interactions between cultivar and inoculum type were significant, data were analyzed separately for each combination, with treatment as the single factor.
Multiple comparisons for treatment means were conducted using
Fisher’s least significant difference test. All statistical procedures were done using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), with a significance value of a = 0.05.Results
In vitro sensitivity of isolates of C. acutatum to fungicides. Of the 74 isolates tested, 29 were determined to be QoI resistant, with
EC50 values for mycelial growth and conidial germination higher than 40 mg/ml (Table 1). The remaining 45 isolates were QoI sensi tive, with mean EC50 values for mycelial growth and germination in hibition of 0.034mg/ml (range 0.015 to 0.064mg/ml) and 0.129mg/ml (range 0.060 to 0.267 mg/ml), respectively. Mean EC50 values for my celial growth for all 74 isolates for chlorothalonil, cyprodinil, fludiox onil, and natamycin were 0.267 mg/ml (range 0.115 to 0.549 mg/ml), 0.025mg/ml (range 0.012 to 0.390mg/ml), 0.001mg/ml (range 0.0006 to 0.0014 mg/ml), and 0.973 mg/ml (range 0.526 to 1.996 mg/ml), respectively. Sensitivity data are presented separately in Table 2 for
QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. For azoxystrobin, a >1,000× difference in sensitivity between sensitive and resistant groups was observed. No significant differences in sensitivity to cyprodinil (P = 0.3468), fludioxonil (P = 0.2556), and natamycin (P = 0.1010) were found for QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. For chlorothalonil,
QoI-sensitive isolates were significantly (P = 0.0375) less sensitive (mean EC50 value of 0.276 mg/ml) than QoI-resistant isolates (mean
EC50 value of 0.250 mg/ml) (Table 2). Pydiflumetofen was not inhib itory to mycelial growth at concentrations of up to 80 mg/ml tested.
Frequency distributions of EC50 categories for each fungicide are shown in the histograms of Figure 1A to F. Distributions for all fun gicides were unimodal, except for azoxystrobin, where a bimodal distribution was observed.
Molecular characterization of QoI resistance in C. acutatum.
All 11 QoI-resistant isolates selected for cytb sequencing were found to contain a single amino acid substitution from glycine (G) to ala nine (A) at codon 143 (G143A mutation), resulting from a base pair substitution from guanine to cytosine. None of the QoI-sensitive iso lates sequenced showed this mutation.
Effect of preplant dip treatments on disease severity and plant mortality. The overall models for severity and mortality dis ease measurements, as well as for the independent variables cultivar, type of inoculum (i.e., QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates of C. acutatum), and treatment, were highly significant (P < 0.0001). There were sig nificant (P < 0.0001) interactions between cultivar and treatment, as well as between type of inoculum and treatment, but not between cultivar and type of inoculum (P = 0.8133 and 0.0564 for severity and mortality, respectively). Due to these interactions, data were analyzed separately for each cultivar and inoculum type. In trial 1, Fronteras was significantly (P < 0.0001) less susceptible to an thracnose crown rot (mean severity 1.4, mean mortality 24.9%) than Portola (mean severity 2.3, mean mortality 52.2%). Similarly, in trial 2, Fronteras was significantly (P < 0.0001) less susceptible (mean severity 1.6, mean mortality 22.4%) than Monterey (mean se verity 2.2, mean mortality 39.9%). Inoculation with QoI-resistant iso lates resulted in significantly (P < 0.0001) higher disease severity (mean 2.1) and incidence of mortality (mean 40.7%) than when using
QoI-sensitive isolates (mean severity 1.6, mean mortality 29.0%).
Disease severity and incidence of mortality of untreated, inocu lated control plants were high at evaluation time 5 weeks after spring time planting of Portola or 14 weeks after fall planting of Monterey strawberry. After inoculation with QoI-sensitive isolates, disease se verity was 3.5 and 3.2 and incidence of mortality was 85.0 and 69.1% for untreated Portola and Monterey controls, respectively (Figs. 2 and 3A to D). After inoculation with QoI-resistant isolates, these values were 4.0 and 3.4, and 100 and 74.6%, for the two cultivars, respectively. In contrast, average disease severity and mortality for two studies with Fronteras planted in the spring or fall were 2.1 and 32.9%, respectively, for QoI-sensitive inoculum and 2.5 and 47%, respectively, for QoI -resistant inoculum (Figs. 2E and F and 3E and F). Fungal isolations from diseased tissues of randomly se lected symptomatic plants confirmed C. acutatum as the causal agent of disease symptoms. Water dip treatments of transplants were gen erally ineffective in reducing disease and mortality as compared with the untreated control, and only resulted in a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in disease severity for Monterey inoculated with QoI resistant isolates of C. acutatum (Fig. 2D).
Transplants of all three strawberry cultivars that were inoculated with QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates and dip treated with nata mycin at either rate or with the pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil or fludioxonil-cyprodinil premixtures in all cases showed signifi cantly (P < 0.05) lower disease severity (Fig. 2) and plant mortality (Fig. 3) as compared with the controls. Furthermore, there were generally no significant (P > 0.05) differences among these four treatments, and the new fungicides provided similar control to the registered premixture of fludioxonil and cyprodinil. Among the six cultivar–inoculum combinations, the 0.5 g/liter rate of natamycin was significantly (P > 0.05) less effective than the 1 g/liter rate only for Portola inoculated with QoI-resistant isolates (Figs. 2B and 3B).
No stunting of plants or other signs of phytotoxicity were observed in any treatment in these trials.
Treatments with azoxystrobin provided a high level of disease control when transplants were inoculated with QoI-sensitive isolates of the pathogen, and efficacy was similar to natamycin or the two pre mixtures containing fludioxonil (Figs. 2A, C, and E and 3A, C, and
E). Azoxystrobin, however, was not effective when plants were

Among the remaining treatments, chlorothalonil showed inconsis tent performance. The fungicide significantly reduced disease se verity as compared with the untreated control in five of the six cultivar–inoculum combinations (Fig. 2) and plant mortality in four of the six combinations (Fig. 3). Efficacy of chlorothalonil was often statistically lower than that of natamycin and the two premixture treatments containing fludioxonil. Pydiflumetofen was among the least effective treatments, and disease severity was significantly reduced from the untreated control only onMonterey using QoI-sensitive inoculum (Fig. 2C). The biocontrol S. lydicus was ineffective in all studies.
Effect of preplant dip treatments on fruit yield.Because harvest frequency and timing were different for the two trials conducted in different growing seasons with Fronteras, data were analyzed sepa rately for each study and inoculum type. Yield data generally reflected performance of the treatments in reducing disease severity and plant mortality (Table 3). Water dip treatments did not result in increased yield as compared with the untreated control except in the first trial with QoI-sensitive inoculum. In both studies, natamycin treatments had yields statistically similar to those of the industry stan dard fludioxonil-cyprodinil or the experimental pydiflumetofen fludioxonil premixture. Yield of azoxystrobin-treated transplants was statistically higher (P < 0.05) than the untreated control and sta tistically similar to natamycin and fludioxonil-containing treat ments in inoculations with QoI-sensitive isolates (Table 3). Yield for azoxystrobin, however, was similar to the untreated control in both studies after inoculation with QoI-resistant isolates.
Fruit yields of the remaining treatments (i.e., water control, S. lydicus, pydiflumetofen, and chlorothalonil) were not significantly different from the untreated control in trial 1. In trial 2, results were similar but chlorothalonil and S. lydicus significantly (P < 0.05) increased yield from the untreated control for transplants inoculated with
QoI-sensitive isolates. Still, natamycin at both rates, fludioxonil containing treatments, and azoxystrobin (in inoculations with QoI sensitive isolates) had the highest numerical yields among all treatments.

Plant Disease /September 2018 1693 Discussion
Preplant dip treatments of strawberry transplants for the man agement of anthracnose crown rot have relied on the use of fludioxonil-cyprodinil and azoxystrobin since the early 2000s. With extensive use of these fungicides for pre- and postplant disease man agement, there is a high risk for selection for resistance. Thus, new pre plant fungicide treatments are needed that have different modes of action from registered products. In this study, we report the distribution and genetic basis for QoI resistance in California populations of
C. acutatum, and we identify a new, highly effective preplant treat ment, the biofungicide natamycin, that has a unique mode of action from all other fungicides registered on strawberry worldwide.
QoI resistance was first described in C. acutatum from strawberry in Florida in 2013 (Forcelini et al. 2016). G143A and F129L muta tions in cytb were identified conferring high and moderate resistance levels, respectively. In our study on California isolates, only the
G143A mutation was detected although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced of the total of 29 isolates that we identified. Because all of our resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml and, thus, were highly resistant, other resistance geno types may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight counties sam pled. Therefore, resistance currently may still be limited in distribu tion but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide infor mation if resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important because resistance conferred by the G143A mutation char acteristically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fernández
Ortuño et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011). Additionally, this mutation was shown to be stable in C. acutatum populations and did not result in a fitness penalty in laboratory assays (Forcelini et al.
2018). In our study, QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were similarly pathogenic but disease severity and mortality after inoculation with resistant isolates were higher than for QoI-sensitive isolates. Several studies on other fungal pathogens have indicated that resistant isolates harboring theG143Amutation did not have reduced fitness as compared withwild-type sensitive isolates (Corio-Costet et al. 2011; Karaoglanidis et al. 2011; Rallos et al. 2014). Fitness of resistant isolates ofMagnaporthe oryzae, however, was reduced (Ma and Uddin 2009).
In vitro toxicities of chlorothalonil, cyprodinil, fludioxonil, and natamycin all exhibited unimodal distributions of sensitivities. Al though cyprodinil and fludioxonil have been used for many years in California strawberry production, no resistant isolates were de tected in our samplings, and results reflect current sensitivity levels in C. acutatum populations in the sampling locations. A high in vitro activity of the fludioxonil-cyprodinil premixture was previously de termined for C. truncatum (Torres-Calzada et al. 2015), and values were in a range similar to that in our evaluation of the individual active ingredients. Because natamycin has never been used in com mercial strawberry production, EC50 values determined can be considered a baseline sensitivity that can be used as a reference in future resistance monitoring.
Although in vitro toxicity of natamycin to C. acutatum was con siderably lower than that of azoxystrobin (using sensitive isolates), fludioxonil, and cyprodinil, dip treatments of strawberry transplants with natamycin were highly effective and similar to those with azoxystrobin (when disease was caused by QoI-sensitive isolates) or fludioxonil-cyprodinil. Chlorothalonil was inconsistent in reducing anthracnose crown rot and plant mortality in our studies. This con firms previous studies on strawberry anthracnose where chlorotha lonil was not very effective (Daugovish et al. 2009). Fruit yields increased as disease severity and plant mortality decreased after treat ment with fungicides that were effective against anthracnose crown rot. Yields overall were much lower in the first trial that was initiated in the spring because high temperatures that sporadically occur at the inland California field site in the spring caused plants to decline. The second trial that was initiated in fall to winter and was harvested in the spring allowed time for greater plant growth. Additionally, flowers during early growth were removed to encourage vegetative growth, and two consecutive harvests were combined in the second study. For both spring- and fall-planted trials, the lack of foliar fun gicide sprays that are standard in commercial field settings also likely contributed to lower overall yield values.
Treatments were evaluated as dips of transplants because planting material is a main source of introducing C. acutatum into a field and, currently, dip treatments of transplants are a common practice in Cal ifornia in the establishment of new strawberry fields. As shown in our results, plant mortality was reduced significantly by natamycin and fludioxonil-cyprodinil when transplants were inoculated with QoI sensitive or -resistant isolates. Under highly favorable disease condi tions, additional foliar treatments will have to be applied to protect plants from petiole and leaf lesions, as well as fruit rot throughout the season, and these can be integrated with those for management of gray mold caused by Botrytis spp. The experimental fungicide pydiflumetofen was not effective against C. acutatum in our in vitro and field studies. This fungicide, however, is very active against
B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew of strawberry (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot of strawberry but this was most likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has po tential as a broad-spectrum postplant field fungicide for strawberry.

Natamycin is classified as a biofungicide because it is a commer cial fermentation product of S. natalensis (Delves-Broughton 2014).
The dip application of transplants developed in this study led to its registration (as the product Zivion M; DSM) on strawberry, repre senting the first use of natamycin in field agriculture. Natamycin pre viously was registered for management of dry bubble disease of mushroom caused by Verticillium fungicola var. fungicola, and as a postharvest treatment for managing citrus and stone fruit decays caused by Monilinia, Penicillium, Geotrichum, and Botrytis spp.
(Chen et al. 2016). Its unique mode of action is the direct binding to ergosterol, the primary sterol in fungi, leading to disruption of membrane function and cellular transport (Aparicio et al. 2016;
Hamilton-Miller 1974). It does not inhibit ergosterol production as do sterol biosynthesis- or demethylation-inhibiting fungicides. Thus, in 2017, it was assigned its own Fungicide Resistance Action Com mittee Code, Number 48 (FRAC 2017). Natamycin is designated as a biopesticide by the United States Environmental Protection Agency and, therefore, it is exempt from pesticide tolerances in the United
States, and is “generally recognized as safe” by the U.S. Food and
Drug Administration. The registration of natamycin is furthermore important for the strawberry industry because, after many years of use in the food industry, resistance in filamentous fungi has not been reported (Delves-Broughton 2014).Acknowledgments
