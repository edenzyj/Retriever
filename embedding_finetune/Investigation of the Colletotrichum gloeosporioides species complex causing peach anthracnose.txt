Hu, M.-J., Grabke, A., and Schnabel, G. 2015. Investigation of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex causing anthracnose fruit rot of peach in South Carolina. Plant Dis. 99:797-805.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. truncatum are causal agents of anthracnose disease of peach in South Carolina, but more recent investigations show that C. gloeosporioides is a species complex that has not yet been investigated among peach isolates. A to tal of 28 Colletotrichum spp. isolates associated with peach fruit an thracnose were collected in 2012 from Chesnee (10 isolates), McBee (10 isolates), Monetta (2 isolates), and Ridge Spring (6 isolates), South
Carolina. Morphological characteristics indicated that all 28 isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and b-tubulin (TUB2) gene sequences identified two species, C. siamense and C. fructicola.
Cultural characteristics such as colony growth rate, shape and size of conidia, and appressoria from representative isolates of the two species largely matched previous descriptions for C. siamense and C. fructi cola. Koch’s postulates for C. siamense and C. fructicola were ful filled, confirming pathogenicity of the two species on peach. A new, two-step multiplex PCR assay was developed to facilitate differentia tion of the four known Colletotrichum spp. causing anthracnose of peach in South Carolina, including C. acutatum, C. truncatum, C. sia mense, and C. fructicola. The first step distinguished C. acutatum from
C. truncatum and the two members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The second assay distinguished C. siamense from C. fructi cola isolates.
The filamentous fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum gloeospor ioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph = Glomerella cin gulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk) causes anthracnose disease on various fruits including peach (Bernstein et al. 1995;
Kim and Hong 2008; Ramsey et al. 1951), blueberry (Hartung et al. 1981; Smith et al. 1996), strawberry (Denoyes and Baudry 1995; Freeman et al. 2002; Smith and Black 1990), almond (Ogawa and English 1991), avocado (Stanley et al. 1996), apple (Bernstein et al. 1995; Shi et al. 1996), papaya (Gamagae et al. 2003), and citrus (Alahakoon and Brown 1994; Liyanage et al. 1992). The disease can develop on stems or twigs, leaves, and fruit of host plants. On peach, the pathogen often occurs in areas and during seasons with high rain fall and warm temperatures (Ogawa et al. 1995). Symptoms include sunken lesions with circular rings where conidia of the fungus are produced in acervuli. Anthracnose disease can occasionally cause yield loss in commercial peach orchards of the southeastern United
States, especially during wet and warm summers.
Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts were based on host specificity and morphological features such as col ony growth rate, color of cultures, conidial size and shape, and shape of appressoria. However, many of the morphological features can change with repeated subculturing or vary under different growing conditions.
Therefore, it is not sufficient to identify fungal species only based on morphological features (Weir et al. 2012). Penzig (1882) first proposed the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, which was collected from citrus in Italy. Von Arx (1957) defined C. gloeosporioides as the anamorph of all fungi with the G. cingulata teleomorph and artificially expanded the spore size range for C. gloeosporioides to overcome the instability of spore mor phology from different hosts or measured under different cultural con ditions. As a consequence, large numbers of Colletotrichum strains with cylindrical conidia from various studies were synonymized with the name C. gloeosporioides (Phoulivong et al. 2010). Some of the synonymy was subsequently found to be incorrect. For example,
C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al.
2003) were segregated from C. gloeosporioides defined by von Arx (1957). In addition, several species regarded as synonyms of the
C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1957) were later identified to be members of the C. acutatum or the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012a, b).
Cannon et al. (2008) used aC. gloeosporioides isolate from an Ital ian orange as epitype. Living strains and sequence data are available from the epitype so that Colletotrichum isolates can be compared by
DNA sequence analyses to identify species, overcoming the inade quacies of traditional morphological identification (Cai et al. 2009;
Hyde et al. 2009a). More than 86% of the ITS sequences from iso lates designated as C. gloeosporioides in GenBank were not conspe cific with the C. gloeosporioides epitype (Cai et al. 2009; Hyde et al.
2009b). Therefore, multi gene loci, which have more informative sites compared with the ribosomal ITS regions, along with morpho logical analyses were used to distinguishColletotrichum species (Cai et al. 2009; Prihastuti et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2009). Recently, Weir et al. (2012) systematically described theC. gloeosporioides species com plex based on phylogenetic analyses of up to eight genes. He reported 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides species com plex. All taxa accepted within this clade were morphologically similar to the broadly defined C. gloeosporioides, as it has been applied in the literature for the past 50 years (Weir et al. 2012).
Bernstein et al. (1995) identified C. gloeosporioides and C. acuta tum as causal agents of peach anthracnose. Recently, a third species,
C. truncatum, was reported to cause anthracnose on peach in South
Carolina (Grabke et al. 2014). Anthracnose symptoms were observed frequently on peach fruit grown in Aiken, Chesterfield, Saluda, and
Spartanburg counties in South Carolina during a disease survey in
August of 2012. Because the C. gloeosporioides species complex has not been investigated in depth for isolates causing peach anthrac nose, there was potential for improving taxonomic delineation of existing species. The objectives of this study were to morphologi cally and phylogenetically characterize C. gloeosporioides isolates from key peach production areas in South Carolina and to develop

Fungal isolates and culture conditions. Peach fruit showing symptoms of anthracnose disease were collected from commercial peach farms in South Carolina during summer 2012. Twenty-eight isolates were collected from different locations in South Carolina, which included Chesnee (10 isolates), McBee (10 isolates), Monetta (2 isolates), and Ridge Spring (6 isolates). The locations represent three key production areas in South Carolina, including the “Ridge” (Monetta and Ridge Springs), the “Piedmont” (Chesnee), and the “North of Midlands” (McBee). To isolate Colletotrichum spp. from these peaches, fruits were surface-sterilized in 10% bleach for 2 min, and then rinsed with sterile distilled water. Lesions were cut in half, and necrotic tissue from the inside of the fruit was placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA). Plates were incubated at 22°C with a 12-h cycle of fluorescent light until sporulating colonies ofColletotrichum spp. had grown. For single-spore isolation, conidia were scraped off the plate using a sterile toothpick, and suspended in 1 ml sterile distilled water. Fifty microliters of the conidial suspen sion was spread on 1.5% (w/v) water agar plates and incubated at 22°C overnight. One germinated conidium was transferred onto po tato dextrose agar (PDA) plates (Difco Laboratories, Sparks, NJ), and plates were incubated at 22°Cwith a 12-h cycle of fluorescent light to induce sporulation. Each isolate was stored as dried mycelium on fil ter paper (Whatman Inc., Maidstone, UK) at −20°C as previously de scribed (Zhu et al. 2012). In addtion, an isolate of C. acutatum (Schnabel et al. 2006) and an isolate of C. truncatum (Grabke et al.
2014), both from peach, were used to validate the identification method developed in this study.
DNA extractions. Isolates selected for phylogenetic analysis were grown on PDA at 25°C for 4 days in the dark. Single agar plugs con taining actively growing mycelium were taken from the periphery of the advancing colonies and transferred to 250-ml flasks containing 40 ml of potato dextrose broth (PDB). Flasks were shaken at 110 rpm for 4 days at 25°C. Developing mycelium was removed from the broth, rinsed under sterile deionized water, and genomic
DNA was subsequently extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR amplification and sequencing. Gene nuclear sequences were obtained from the calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and b-tubulin (TUB2) genes, respectively. The CAL gene region was amplified from genomic
DNAwith primer pairs CL1C/CL2C (Weir et al. 2012). The standard
GAPDH (Templeton et al. 1992) and TUB2 (O’Donnell and Cigelnik 1997) primers yielded poor or nonspecific amplification. Therefore, new primers were designed. Forward primer (GDF1) was designed for GAPDH amplification and reverse primer (TubR1) was designed for TUB2 amplification based on the C. graminicola M1.001 (also known as M2) genome sequence and based on the TUB2 sequence of a C. gloeosporioides isolate from GenBank (U14138), respec tively (Table 1).
All amplifications were performed using the T100 Bio-Rad ther mal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) in a total vol ume of 25 ml. The PCR mixtures contained 1 × PCR buffer, 20 ng template DNA, 0.6 mM of each primer, 200 mM of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich,
MA). The amplification parameters for the CAL gene consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min followed by 34 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 57°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min, and a final elongation step of 72°C for 5 min. The parameters for amplification of the GAPDH and TUB2 genes were largely as described above, except that the annealing temperature were reduced to 55°C, and extension times were 30 s and 2 min for the GAPDH and TUB2 amplifications, re spectively. Unincorporated primers and dNTPs remaining in the
PCR products were removed using ExoSAP-IT reagent according to the manufacturer’s instruction. Sequencing was conducted at
Clemson University Genomics Institute (CUGI; Clemson, SC). Phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to characterize and identify Colletotrichum species of peach. Weir et al.
(2012) determined that C. siamense and C. fructicola are separate spe cies.We performed an analysis for a combined data matrix of the three coding loci (CAL,GAPDH, and TUB2). Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using DNASTAR (DNASTAR Inc., Nevada City,
CA) and CLUSTALX v. 2.1 (Larkin et al. 2007; Thompson et al.
1997). CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences of Colletotri chum species within theMusae clade (Weir et al. 2012) were obtained from GenBank as reference sequences, including those for C. sia mense, C. fructicola, C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum,
C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. queens landicum, C. salsolae, and C. tropicale (Table 2). Maximum parsimony (MP) method and maximum likelihood (ML) methods were used to carry out phylogenetic reconstruction respectively using MEGA ver sion 6.0 (Tamura et al. 2013). The MP tree was inferred using the subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPR) search option and 1,000 random sequence additions (level = 1). For theML tree, the following settings were used: the Tamura 3-parameter model, gamma distributed (5 cat egories), and heuristic method using SPR-extensive. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates was used to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (Felsenstein 1985).
Morphological and cultural characterization. Starter cultures were prepared by plating each isolate onto PDA at 25°C. Five millimeter-diameter plugs were aseptically removed from the periph ery of actively growing, 4-day-old cultures using a sterile cork borer.

Each plug was placed onto a petri dish (90 mm diameter) filled with 20 ml of PDA and grown at 25°C in the dark. Three replicate cultures of each isolate were investigated. The colony diameter was measured daily for at least 5 days and the growth rate was calculated in milli meter per day. After 6 days of incubation, conidia were harvested in 200 ml of sterile water. The length and width of at least 20 conidia from each isolate were measured with a stage micrometer using an
OLYMPUS BX41TF microscope (Olympus Optical Co., LTD.,
Japan) at 400× magnification. For appressorial formation, two drops of a conidial suspension (20 ml; 105 conidia/ml) were placed on a mi croscope slide and then placed inside petri dishes containing moist filter paper. The slides were incubated at 25°C in darkness for 2 days.
Appressoria were formed from germ tubes and their sizes and shapes were measured as described above. Mean and standard deviation val ues were calculated for mycelial growth rate, the size of conidia, and appressoria.
Pathogenicity assay on detached fruit. Ripe but still firm peach fruit were washed with soap and water, surface sterilized for 2 min in 10% bleach, and rinsed with sterile distilled water. Wetted paper tow els were placed on the bottom of a carbon fiber tray containing 18 perforated pockets. Fruit were placed in a randomized block design on 4 cm i.d. plastic rings located in the pockets of the tray and air dried overnight. For inoculation, a 10-ml droplet of conidial suspen sion prepared in sterile distilled water (1 to 2 × 104 spores/ml) was placed on three equidistant points, each about 2 cm apart, on each peach fruit. Control fruit received sterile water without conidia.
The trays were covered with domes, wrapped in a clear plastic bag for 2 days to keep the relative humidity high, and incubated at room temperature for 6 days. Disease incidence (DI) was expressed as the percentage of infected spots compared with the total number of spots inoculated. Lesion diameters (LDs) were measured with a ruler.
Three isolates of each species were used for inoculation and six fruit were used for each isolate. The experiment was performed twice.
Bartlett’s test for equal variances was performed to test whether the LD data of the two independent experiments could be combined.
T-test and Fisher’s exact test were used to determine whether the LD and DI of the two species were statistically different from each other, respectively. Analysis of variance and significant difference proce dures were conducted using JMP Pro 10.0.0 software (SAS Institute
Inc., Cary, NC). Development of a multiplex PCR method to distinguish the 
Colletotrichum species.A two-step PCR assay was developed to dis tinguish among Colletotrichum species from peach. In the first PCR, five primers were combined to amplify fragments from bothCAL and
GAPDH genes. Primer pair GDF1 / C-GAPDH-R amplified a frag ment from GAPDH from each of the four species as a positive con trol. Primer pair CALF1 / Cg-R amplified a fragment of CAL only from theC. gloeosporioides species complex and primer pair CALF1 /
Ca-R1 amplified a fragment of CAL only from C. acutatum. The sec ond PCR distinguished the two species in theC. gloeosporioides spe cies complex. This PCR cocktail contained four primers, including primer pair G3F1 / C-GAPDH-R that amplified aGAPDH gene frag ment from both species as a positive control. Primer pair CL1C /
CALR1 amplified a fragment from the CAL gene from C. fructicola isolates but not from C. siamense isolates. GAPDH gene primers for species delineation were designed based on the aligned sequences from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and
C. fructicola) isolates, C. acutatum (JQ948686), and C. truncatum (KC109617). CAL gene primers were designed based on the aligned sequences from C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. acutatum isolates from our collection with the exception of the CL1C primer (Weir et al. 2012). PCR reactions were carried out in a volume of 25ml con taining 1 × PCR buffer, 200mMof each dNTP, 20 ng template DNA, 0.25 mM of each primer, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (New
England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). For the first PCR, the amplification program consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for 4 min fol lowed by 35 cycles of 40 s at 94°C, 40 s at 56°C, and 1 min at 72°C, and a final extension step at 72°C for 5 min. For the second
PCR, amplification parameters were identical to the first PCR, except that the annealing temperature was increased to 58°C. Products were

Phylogenetic analysis of CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 sequences.
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using the combined sequences of the CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 genes from the 28 isolates of this study and reference strains (Table 2). There were 1,664 nucleotide positions included in the final dataset. In the MP phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1), the 28 isolates from South Carolina clustered into two large groups with high bootstrap support (99%). All isolates coded OD12,
EY12, and isolates RR12-2, RR12-4, and RR12-6 formed a clade with
C. siamense reference strains ICMP 17795, ICMP 18121, and ICMP 18642. This clade was most closely related to a clade formed by two reference isolates of the C. aeschynomenes and C. tropicale species.
All isolates coded SE12, and isolates RR12-1 and RR12-5 clustered with C. fructicola reference strains ICMP 18646 and ICMP 18727, whereas isolate RR12-3 clustered with another C. fructicola reference strain ICMP 18645 (Fig. 1). The ML analysis of the combined DNA sequences generated a topological structure that was largely identical to the structure obtained using MP analysis (Fig. 2). CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences were deposited in GenBank (Table 2).
Colony morphology and mycelial growth rate. Distinct colony morphology on PDA medium was observed in C. siamense and
C. fructicola after 6 days of incubation (Fig. 3A and B). Colonies pro duced by isolates fromC. siamense varied in color fromwhite or gray to pale brown with dense whitish-gray aerial mycelium and a few bright orange conidial masses near the center (Fig. 3A). Colonies produced byC. fructicola isolates were more uniform and were white or gray at first, and later became dark green with dense pale gray ae rial mycelium (Fig. 3B).
The mean and range of colony growth rate on PDA medium were similar for C. siamense and C. fructicola (Table 3). The mean colony growth rates of C. siamense isolates were 12.9 ± 1.9 mm per day, ranging from 9.7 to 17 mm per day. The mean colony growth rate of C. fructicola was 13.1 ± 1.7 mm per day, ranging from 9.8 to 16.5 mm per day (Table 3).
Characterization of conidia and appressoria. There was little difference between the C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates in regard to the size and shape of conidia. Conidial shape of these two species were both cylindrical with obtuse to rounded ends.
The mean length and width of conidia was 16.0 ± 2.1 × 4.9 ± 0.2 mm, ranging from 8.4 to 20.5 × 4.8 to 6.0 mm for C. siamense, whereas the mean length and width was 16.8 ± 3.3 × 5.0 ± 0.5 mm, ranging from 8.4 to 26.5 × 4.8 to 6.0 mm for C. fructicola (Table 3). Appressorial shapes produced by C. siamense were ovate,

There were a total of 1,664 positions in the final dataset. 800 Plant Disease /Vol. 99 No. 6 whereas the shape varied from clavate to ovate in C. fructicola iso lates. The average appressorial size of C. fructicola isolates was larger than that for C. siamense isolates (Table 3). The mean length and width of appressoria was 7.3 ± 1.0 × 4.8 ± 0.8 mm, ranging from 5.1 to 9.6 × 3.1 to 6.7 mm for C. siamense, whereas the mean length and width was 8.2 ± 1.1 × 5.1 ± 0.6 mm, ranging from 6.0 to 10.8 × 3.6 to 6.0 mm for C. fructicola.
Pathogenicity of C. siamense and C. fructicola. Both C. sia mense and C. fructicola tested were pathogenic and sporulated on peach fruit. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled by reisolating the fungus from symptomatic fruit and reidentifying the pathogen to the species level (data not shown). LD data of each isolate of the two indepen dent experiments was merged, because variances between experi ments were equal (P > 0.05). The average LD of C. fructicola isolates was significantly larger than that of C. siamense isolates (P < 0.05). The mean LD for C. fructicola was 1.57 ± 0.34 cm, and ranged from 0.60 to 2.15 cm, whereas the mean LD for C. siamense was 1.40 ± 0.30 cm, ranging from 0.70 to 1.85 cm. There was no sig nificant difference between the DI values of C. siamense isolates and
C. fructicola isolates (P > 0.05). The average DI value ofC. siamense isolates was 92.6% and ranged from 91.7 to 94.4%, whereas the av erage value for C. fructicola isolates was 95.4% ranging from 88.9 to 100% (Table 4). C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates produced largely identical symptoms, except that the lesions on fruit inoculated with C. siamense developed a denser, whiter mycelium than those of
C. fructicola isolates (Fig. 4A and B). Development of a molecular tool to distinguish Colletotrichum species affecting peach. A two-step multiplex PCR method was de veloped to differentiate South Carolina Colletotrichum species on peach. The first PCR amplified a 359-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene with primer pair GDF1 / C-GAPDH-R from all Colletotrichum species. The cocktail also contained forward primer CALF1 and re verse primers Cg-R and Ca-R1, which produced amplicons 649 or 491 bp in length from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and C. fructicola) or C. acutatum, respectively (Fig. 5A).
For the second PCR, primer pair G3F1 / C-GAPDH-R generated a 280-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene from both C. siamense and C. fructicola and primer pair CL1C / CALR1 generated a 550-bp fragment from the CAL gene from C. fructicola, but not from C. sia mense (Fig. 5B). All isolates used in this study for the phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity tests were subjected to this test and pro duced the expected amplicon sizes with this newmultiplex PCR tool.Discussion
The main objective of this study was to identify and character ize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of peach in South Carolina based on DNA sequence data and mor phological characters. All isolates collected for this study were

A discrete gamma distribution was used to model evolutionary rate differences among sites (five categories (+G, parameter = 0.1303)). There were a total of 1,664 positions in the final dataset.
Plant Disease / June 2015 801 micromorphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides according to von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, previous identification methods were based on morphology alone, which cannot unequivo cally place an isolate in this species complex. For example, species in
C. gloeosporioides species complex (Cannon et al. 2012; Weir et al.
2012) are micromorphologically similar to C. cliviae (Yang et al.
2009) and members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b). Weir et al. (2012) defined the limit of the Colletotri chum species complex genetically on the basis of up to eight gene sequences, and delimited 22 species within the species complex that formed a strongly supported clade based on ITS sequences (Cannon et al. 2012). It clearly indicated 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. But further analyses deter mined that not all eight gene sequences are necessary to reliably distinguish Colletotrichum species; GAPDH and TUB2 gene se quences distinguished species reliably for most taxa within this spe cies complex (Weir et al. 2012). In addition, CAL gene sequences distinguished between C. siamense and C. fructicola better than sequences of ITS, GAPDH, TUB2 (b-tubulin 2), ACT (actin),
CHS-1 (chitin synthase),GS (glutamine synthetase), or SOD (manga nese superoxide dismutase) (Weir et al. 2012). In this study, the com bined sequence data of GAPDH, TUB2, and CAL clearly identified
C. gloeosporioides isolates from South Carolina to be either C. sia mense or C. fructicola when compared with sequences available inGenBank.
This is the first time C. siamense and C. fructicola were isolated from peach. Both species were originally isolated from coffee berries in northern Thailand (Prihastuti et al. 2009). According

(2012), these two species are biologically and geo graphically diverse. Besides infecting Coffea, C. siamense has been found on many hosts including Persea americana, Pistacia vera, Hymenocallis americana, Dioscorea rotundata, Carica pa paya, Capsicum annuum, Vitis vinifera, Fragaria × ananassa,
Malus domestica, and Jasminium sambac, whereas C. fructicola was isolated from Pyrus pyrifolia, Limonium, Malus domestica,
Fragaria × ananassa, Persea americana, Ficus, Dioscorea, Theo broma, and Tetragastris (Weir et al. 2012). C. siamense and C. fruc ticola have been isolated from strawberry and C. siamense from blueberry from the southeastern United States, which along with this study supports their role as fruit pathogens in the southeast (Hu et al.2015).
CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences from C. siamense isolates were variable but phylogenetic analysis revealed all isolates from our collection clustered around C. siamense reference isolates
ICMP 17795, ICMP 18642, and ICMP 18121. The genetic variabil ity may in part be explained by the geographic isolation of some of the distinct genotypes (e.g., OD isolates were collected 160 km apart from other isolates). Rojas et al. (2010) noted the occurrence of two distinct haplotype subgroups (A4-3 and A5-4) within their species concept of C. ignotum (C. fructicola), which was confirmed by Weir et al. (2012). Together, the haplotype subgroups were monophyletic within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides species complex.
Both clades include isolates from a wide range of hosts from many countries, and both are similar in cultural appearance and morphol ogy (Weir et al. 2012). Two isolates from group I (ICMP 18646 and ICMP 18727) and one isolate from group II (ICMP 18645; named “group I” and “group II” for the two subgroups in this study) ofC. fructicolawere selected as references for phylogenetic analysis.
Results of this study showed that isolates from both groups existed on peaches from South Carolina and both occurred at the same location (Ridge Spring; Figs. 1 and 2). In comparison with the previous study (Weir et al. 2012), our MP and ML analyses indicated group II iso lates of C. fructicola were more closely related to the species of
C. tropicale andC. aeschynomenes than to group I isolates ofC. fructicola (Figs. 1 and 2). The difference between the studies may be a result of different nucleotide sequences used in each phylogenetic analysis.

In addition to the phylogenetic analysis, morphological features including cultural characteristics, colony growth rate, shape and size of conidia, Appressoria, and detached fruit assays were investigated in this study (Table 3). Cultural characteristics of C. siamense and
C. fructicola isolates were in agreement with previous studies (Prihastuti et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2009). Colonies of C. siamense were either white with some gray or white with some orange, while
C. fructicola colonies had dark gray centers and white peripheral my celium. Moreover, the differences of conidia size between our C. sia mense and C. fructicola isolates were consistent with the variation of conidia size for C. siamense and C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012). For example, conidial size variation of these two species was similar within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Mean length of
C. siamense conidia was slightly shorter than that of C. fructicola, whereas the mean width of C. siamense conidia was nearly identical to that of C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012). In addition, the colony growth rate and appressorial size of C. fructicola were higher and larger, respectively, compared with those of C. siamense when grown on PDA at 28°C in the dark, which was consistent with data published previously (Prihastuti et al. 2009). However, there were differences in size of conidia and appressoria between the studies.
For example, the mean conidia length of our C. siamense isolates was 16.0 mm, whereas Prihastuti et al. (2009) reported a mean length of 10.17 mm. This may be a result of a different cultural condition or because isolates were from different hosts. Yang et al. (2009) used the same C. siamense isolates of the Prihastuti et al. (2009) study and determined conidial length to be 15.3 mm.
Four Colletotrichum species are now known to cause anthracnose fruit rot of peach in South Carolina. They are C. siamense, C. fructi cola (both described in this study), C. acutatum, and C. truncatum (Grabke et al. 2014; Schnabel et al. 2006). The prevalence of anthrac nose fruit rot is still very low in South Carolina according to a survey conducted at recent production meetings in Gaffney and Edgefield,
SC. Previous studies had shown that C. acutatum and species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex are the most common spe cies and that they can easily be confused based on morphological parameters (Damm et al. 2012a; Simmonds 1965). Therefore, a new PCR-based method was developed in this study to differentiate
Colletotrichum spp. infecting peach. The method is based on a two step PCR assay that distinguished the four species and included an internal PCR control in both steps to verify suitable PCR amplifica tion material and conditions. The Colletotrichum isolates included in this study were successfully identified as C. siamense, C. fructicola, or C. acutatum using our new PCR-based assay. Additional C. acu tatum isolates in our collection that were characterized in a previous study (Schnabel et al. 2006) were also accurately identified (data not shown). We do not know the composition of species within the
C. gloeosporioides complex from other peach production areas and therefore this PCR assay may have to be validated with isolates from other geographic areas. Also, this identification method may not be applicable to distinguishC. gloeosporioides andC. acutatum isolates from other hosts on a species level since both species represent spe cies complexes that include more than 20 different species each (Damm et al. 2012a; Weir et al. 2012).
C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum are common causal agents of anthracnose on different fruits (Adaskaveg and Hartin 1997;
Bernstein et al. 1995; Kim and Hong 2008; Phoulivong et al.
2010). Bernstein et al. (1995) identified most of the isolates collected from peach in South Carolina to be C. acutatum; only one isolate of 19 was C. gloeosporioides. This is in sharp contrast to the collection examined in this study, as we only found two isolates of C. acutatum in the locations sampled (data not shown). This may have been due to our small sample size. However, a more likely explanation is based on inherent differences in fungicide sensitivity of C. acutatum com pared with C. gloeosporioides. Bernstein et al. (1995) found that
C. acutatum strains were more resistant to benzimidazole (also known as MBC) fungicides. Relative growth of C. acutatum isolates ranged between 17 and 47% on the discriminatory dose of 2 mg/ml benomyl, whereas none of the C. gloeosporioides isolates from peach grew at that dose. MBC fungicides were used more commonly at and prior to the Bernstein study for control of different fruit diseases compared with recent years, which may have given C. acutatum a selective ad vantage. However, MBC fungicides were gradually replaced by new site-specific fungicides for disease management over the past two to three decades due to benzimidazole resistance concerns in the major target pathogen Monilinia fructicola (Zehr et al. 1991).
In conclusion, this study establishes the existence of two species within C. gloeosporioides species complex causing anthracnose fruit rot of peach in South Carolina as documented by pathogenicity stud ies. Together with C. acutatum and C. truncatum, a total of four spe cies are now known to cause peach anthracnose in the southeast.
A molecular assay designed based on GADPH and CAL nucleotide sequences data was developed and used successfully to distinguish the four species.

GAPDH-R produced a 359-bp fragment (lanes 1 to 6) from all four species. Forward primer CALF1 and reverse primers Cg-R and Ca-R1 produced amplicons 649 bp (lanes 1 to 4) or 491 bp (lane 5) in length from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and C. fructicola) or C. acutatum, respectively. For the second PCR (B) primer pair G3F1/C
GAPDH-R produced a 280-bp fragment (lanes 1 to 4) from both C. siamense and C. fructicola. Primers CL1C and CALR1 produced a 550-bp fragment from C. fructicola (lanes 3 and 4) but not from C. siamense (lanes 1 and 2). 804 Plant Disease /Vol. 99 No. 6 Acknowledgments
