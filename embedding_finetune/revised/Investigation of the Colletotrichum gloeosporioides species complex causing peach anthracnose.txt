Hu, M.-J., Grabke, A., and Schnabel, G. 2015. Investigation of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex causing anthracnose fruit rot of peach in South Carolina. Plant Disease 99:797-805.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. truncatum are causal agents of anthracnose disease in peach in South Carolina. More recent investigations reveal that C. gloeosporioides is a species complex that has not yet been studied among peach isolates. A total of 28 Colletotrichum spp. isolates associated with peach fruit anthracnose were collected in 2012 from Chesnee (10 isolates), McBee (10 isolates), Monetta (2 isolates), and Ridge Spring (6 isolates) in South Carolina. Morphological characteristics indicated that all 28 isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Phylogenetic analysis of the combined calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and β-tubulin (TUB2) gene sequences identified two species: C. siamense and C. fructicola.
The filamentous fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph = Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk) causes anthracnose disease on various fruits, including peach (Bernstein et al. 1995; Kim and Hong 2008; Ramsey et al. 1951), blueberry (Hartung et al. 1981; Smith et al. 1996), strawberry (Denoyes and Baudry 1995; Freeman et al. 2002; Smith and Black 1990), almond (Ogawa and English 1991), avocado (Stanley et al. 1996), apple (Bernstein et al. 1995; Shi et al. 1996), papaya (Gamagae et al. 2003), and citrus (Alahakoon and Brown 1994; Liyanage et al. 1992). The disease can develop on stems, twigs, leaves, and fruit of host plants. On peach, the pathogen often occurs in areas and during seasons with high rainfall and warm temperatures (Ogawa et al. 1995). Symptoms include sunken lesions with circular rings, where conidia of the fungus are produced in acervuli. Anthracnose disease can occasionally cause yield loss in commercial peach orchards in the southeastern United States, especially during wet and warm summers.
Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts were based on host specificity and morphological features such as colony growth rate, color of cultures, conidial size and shape, and the shape of appressoria. However, many of these morphological features can change with repeated subculturing or vary under different growing conditions. Therefore, it is insufficient to identify fungal species solely based on morphological features (Weir et al. 2012). Penzig (1882) first proposed the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, which was collected from citrus in Italy. Von Arx (1957) defined C. gloeosporioides as the anamorph of all fungi with the G. cingulata teleomorph and artificially expanded the spore size range for C. gloeosporioides to overcome the instability of spore morphology from different hosts or under different cultural conditions. Consequently, a large number of Colletotrichum strains were identified.

Cylindrical conidia from various studies have been synonymized with the name C. gloeosporioides (Phoulivong et al., 2010). However, some of these synonymies were later found to be incorrect. For instance, C. acutatum (Simmonds, 1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al., 2003) were segregated from C. gloeosporioides, as defined by von Arx (1957). Additionally, several species previously regarded as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx were subsequently identified as members of the C. acutatum or C. boninense species complex (Damm et al., 2012a, b).
Cannon et al. (2008) used a C. gloeosporioides isolate from an Italian orange as an epitype. Living strains and sequence data are available from this epitype, allowing for comparison of Colletotrichum isolates through DNA sequence analyses, which helps overcome the limitations of traditional morphological identification (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2009a). More than 86% of the ITS sequences from isolates designated as C. gloeosporioides in GenBank were not conspecific with the C. gloeosporioides epitype (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2009b). Consequently, multiple gene loci, which offer more informative sites compared to the ribosomal ITS regions, along with morphological analyses, were utilized to distinguish Colletotrichum species (Cai et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009). Recently, Weir et al. (2012) systematically described the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on phylogenetic analyses of up to eight genes. They reported 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. All taxa accepted within this clade were morphologically similar to the broadly defined C. gloeosporioides, as it has been referenced in the literature for the past 50 years (Weir et al., 2012).
Bernstein et al. (1995) identified C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum as causal agents of peach anthracnose. Recently, a third species, C. truncatum, was reported to cause anthracnose on peach in South Carolina (Grabke et al., 2014). Anthracnose symptoms were frequently observed on peach fruit grown in Aiken, Chesterfield, Saluda, and Spartanburg counties in South Carolina during a disease survey in August 2012. Since the C. gloeosporioides species complex has not been thoroughly investigated for isolates causing peach anthracnose, there is potential for improving the taxonomic delineation of existing species. The objectives of this study were to morphologically and phylogenetically characterize C. gloeosporioides isolates from key peach production areas in South Carolina and to develop a rapid, PCR-based method for differentiating the identified Colletotrichum species.
DNA Extractions: Isolates selected for phylogenetic analysis were grown on PDA at 25°C for 4 days in the dark. Single agar plugs containing actively growing mycelium were taken from the periphery of the advancing colonies and transferred to 250-ml flasks containing 40 ml of potato dextrose broth (PDB). Flasks were shaken at 110 rpm for 4 days at 25°C. Developing mycelium was removed from the broth, rinsed under sterile deionized water, and genomic DNA was subsequently extracted using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (Qiagen Inc., Valencia, CA) according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
PCR Amplification and Sequencing: Gene nuclear sequences were obtained from the calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and β-tubulin (TUB2) genes, respectively. The CAL gene region was amplified from genomic DNA with primer pairs CL1C/CL2C (Weir et al. 2012). The standard GAPDH (Templeton et al. 1992) and TUB2 (O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997) primers yielded poor or nonspecific amplification. Therefore, new primers were designed. Forward primer (GDF1) was designed for GAPDH amplification, and reverse primer (TubR1) was designed for TUB2 amplification based on the C. graminicola M1.001 (also known as M2) genome sequence and the TUB2 sequence of a C. gloeosporioides isolate from GenBank (U14138), respectively (see Table 1).
All amplifications were performed using the T100 Bio-Rad thermal cycler (Bio-Rad Laboratories Inc., Hercules, CA) in a total volume of 25 ml. The PCR mixtures contained 1× PCR buffer, 20 ng template DNA, 0.6 mM of each primer, 200 mM of each dNTP, and 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (New England Biolabs, Ipswich, MA). The amplification parameters for the CAL gene consisted of an initial denaturation at 94°C for 3 min, followed by 34 cycles of 94°C for 40 s, 57°C for 40 s, and 72°C for 1 min, with a final elongation step of 72°C for 5 min. The parameters for amplification of the GAPDH and TUB2 genes were largely as described above, except that the annealing temperature was reduced to 55°C, and extension times were 30 s and 2 min for the GAPDH and TUB2 amplifications, respectively. Unincorporated primers and dNTPs remaining in the PCR products were removed using ExoSAP-IT reagent according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Sequencing was conducted at Clemson University Genomics Institute (CUGI; Clemson, SC).
Phylogenetic Analysis: Phylogenetic analysis was conducted to characterize and identify Colletotrichum species of peach. Weir et al. (2012) determined that C. siamense and C. fructicola are separate species. We performed an analysis for a combined data matrix of the three coding loci (CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2). Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using DNASTAR (DNASTAR Inc., Nevada City, CA) and CLUSTALX v. 2.1 (Larkin et al. 2007; Thompson et al. 1997). CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences of Colletotrichum species within the Musae clade (Weir et al. 2012) were obtained from GenBank as reference sequences, including those for C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. queenslandicum, C. salsolae, and C. tropicale (see Table 2). The maximum parsimony (MP) method and maximum likelihood (ML) methods were used to carry out phylogenetic reconstruction respectively using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al. 2013). The MP tree was inferred using the subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPR) search option and 1,000 random sequence additions (level=1). For the ML tree, the following settings were used: the Tamura 3-parameter model, gamma distributed (5 categories), and heuristic method using SPR-extensive. The bootstrap consensus tree inferred from 1,000 replicates was used to represent the evolutionary history of the taxa analyzed (Felsenstein 1985).

Each fungal plug was placed on a 90 mm diameter Petri dish filled with 20 mL of PDA and grown at 25°C in the dark. Three replicate cultures for each isolate were evaluated. The colony diameter was measured daily for at least five days to calculate the growth rate in millimeters per day. After six days, conidia were harvested in 200 mL of sterile water, and the length and width of at least 20 conidia from each isolate were measured using an OLYMPUS BX41TF microscope at 400x magnification. For appressorial formation, two drops of a conidial suspension (20 µL at 10^5 conidia/mL) were placed on a microscope slide and incubated on moist filter paper in Petri dishes at 25°C in darkness for two days. The sizes and shapes of appressoria formed from germ tubes were also measured, and mean and standard deviation values were calculated for mycelial growth rate, conidia size, and appressoria.
Ripe but firm peach fruit were washed with soap and water, surface sterilized in 10% bleach for 2 minutes, and rinsed with sterile distilled water. Wet paper towels were placed at the bottom of a carbon fiber tray containing 18 perforated pockets. The fruit were arranged in a randomized block design on 4 cm diameter plastic rings in the tray and air-dried overnight. For inoculation, a 10 µL droplet of conidial suspension (1 to 2 × 10^4 spores/mL) was placed at three equidistant points (about 2 cm apart) on each peach. Control fruit received sterile water without conidia. The trays were covered with domes and wrapped in a clear plastic bag for two days to maintain high humidity, then incubated at room temperature for six days. Disease incidence (DI) was calculated as the percentage of infected spots relative to the total number of spots inoculated. Lesion diameters (LDs) were measured with a ruler. Three isolates of each species were used for inoculation, with six fruits per isolate, and the experiment was repeated twice. Bartlett's test for equal variances was conducted to assess the LD data from the two experiments. A T-test and Fisher’s exact test were employed to evaluate whether the LD and DI of the two species were statistically different, with analysis of variance and significant difference procedures performed using JMP Pro 10.0.0 software (SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC).
This table summarizes the GenBank accession numbers associated with various species of Colletotrichum isolates utilized in the phylogenetic analyses. It includes entries for the following species: C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. queenslandicum, C. salsolae, and C. tropicale.
Each isolate is categorized by its culture source and is accompanied by specific accession numbers for three genes: CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2. For instance, isolates OD12-1, EY12-1, EY12-2, EY12-3, and others are included under C. siamense, with respective accession numbers listed. The table provides a comprehensive reference for tracking genetic information linked to these isolates, showing both new findings from the current study and previously established data from GenBank.
Phylogenetic analysis of the CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 sequences was performed using combined sequences from 28 isolates, revealing two major clusters with strong bootstrap support (99%). Isolates grouped by their respective codes (e.g., OD12, EY12) formed distinct clades alongside reference strains, particularly for C. siamense and C. fructicola. The phylogenetic trees generated were consistent across different analysis methods.
In terms of colony morphology, C. siamense exhibited varied coloration on PDA medium, ranging from white to pale brown, with prominent orange conidial masses. In contrast, C. fructicola colonies were more uniform, transitioning from white or gray to dark green over time.
Growth rates were similar for both species, with C. siamense averaging 12.9 ± 1.9 mm per day, and C. fructicola averaging 13.1 ± 1.7 mm per day, indicating comparable mycelial growth under the same conditions.
Fig. 1. Phylogeny of the Colletotrichum isolates from peach and species within the Musae clade of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A maximum parsimony (MP) tree was inferred from the dataset containing the combined DNA sequences of CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2. The numbers labeled at each node indicate the bootstrap (BS) percentage (n = 1,000). The consistency index, retention index, and composite index for parsimony-informative sites were 0.679245, 0.915842, and 0.622081, respectively, and the composite index for all sites was 0.790787. There were a total of 1,664 positions in the final dataset.
In the study, the shape of appressoria varied from clavate to ovate in C. fructicola isolates. The average appressorial size of C. fructicola isolates was larger than that of C. siamense isolates (see Table 3). The mean length and width of appressoria for C. siamense were 7.3 ± 1.0 µm and 4.8 ± 0.8 µm, respectively, ranging from 5.1 to 9.6 µm in length and 3.1 to 6.7 µm in width. For C. fructicola, the mean length and width were 8.2 ± 1.1 µm and 5.1 ± 0.6 µm, with ranges from 6.0 to 10.8 µm in length and 3.6 to 6.0 µm in width.
Pathogenicity of C. siamense and C. fructicola: Both C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates tested were pathogenic and sporulated on peach fruit. Koch's postulates were fulfilled by reisolating the fungus from symptomatic fruit and reidentifying the pathogen to the species level (data not shown). The lethal dose (LD) data from each isolate of the two independent experiments were combined because variances between experiments were equal (P > 0.05). The average LD for C. fructicola isolates was significantly larger than that for C. siamense isolates (P < 0.05). The mean LD for C. fructicola was 1.57 ± 0.34 cm, ranging from 0.60 to 2.15 cm, while the mean LD for C. siamense was 1.40 ± 0.30 cm, ranging from 0.70 to 1.85 cm. There was no significant difference between the disease index (DI) values of C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates (P > 0.05). The average DI value for C. siamense isolates was 92.6%, ranging from 91.7% to 94.4%, whereas the average value for C. fructicola isolates was 95.4%, ranging from 88.9% to 100% (see Table 4). The isolates of C. siamense and C. fructicola produced largely identical symptoms, except that lesions on fruit inoculated with C. siamense developed a denser, whiter mycelium than those of C. fructicola isolates (see Fig. 4A and B).
Development of a molecular tool to distinguish Colletotrichum species affecting peach: A two-step multiplex PCR method was developed to differentiate Colletotrichum species affecting peach in South Carolina. The first PCR amplified a 359-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene using primer pair GDF1/C-GAPDH-R from all Colletotrichum species. The cocktail also contained forward primer CALF1 and reverse primers Cg-R and Ca-R1, which produced amplicons of 649 bp or 491 bp in length from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and C. fructicola) or C. acutatum, respectively (see Fig. 5A). In the second PCR, primer pair G3F1/C-GAPDH-R generated a 280-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene from both C. siamense and C. fructicola, while primer pair CL1C/CALR1 generated a 550-bp fragment from the CAL gene from C. fructicola, but not from C. siamense (see Fig. 5B). All isolates used in this study for phylogenetic analysis and pathogenicity tests were subjected to this test and produced the expected amplicon sizes with this new multiplex PCR tool.
The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of peach in South Carolina based on DNA sequence data and morphological characteristics. All isolates collected for this study were...
Micromorphologically, the isolates were typical of C. gloeosporioides according to von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). Previous identification methods relied solely on morphology, which cannot unequivocally place an isolate within this species complex. For example, species in the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Cannon et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012) are micromorphologically similar to C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) and members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b). Weir et al. (2012) defined the genetic limits of the Colletotrichum species complex based on up to eight gene sequences, identifying 22 species that formed a strongly supported clade based on ITS sequences (Cannon et al. 2012). This indicated 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Further analyses showed that not all eight gene sequences are necessary to reliably distinguish Colletotrichum species; the GAPDH and TUB2 gene sequences were sufficient for most taxa within this complex (Weir et al. 2012). Additionally, CAL gene sequences provided better distinction between C. siamense and C. fructicola than ITS, GAPDH, TUB2 (β-tubulin 2), ACT (actin), CHS-1 (chitin synthase), GS (glutamine synthetase), or SOD (manganese superoxide dismutase) sequences (Weir et al. 2012). In this study, the combined sequence data of GAPDH, TUB2, and CAL clearly identified C. gloeosporioides isolates from South Carolina as either C. siamense or C. fructicola when compared with sequences available in GenBank.
This is the first time C. siamense and C. fructicola have been isolated from peach. Both species were originally isolated from coffee berries in northern Thailand (Prihastuti et al. 2009). According to Weir et al. (2012), these two species exhibit biological and geographical diversity. Besides infecting Coffea, C. siamense has been found on various hosts including Persea americana, Pistacia vera, Hymenocallis americana, Dioscorea rotundata, Carica papaya, Capsicum annuum, Vitis vinifera, Fragaria ananassa, Malus domestica, and Jasminum sambac. In contrast, C. fructicola has been isolated from Pyrus pyrifolia, Limonium, Malus domestica, Fragaria ananassa, Persea americana, Ficus, Dioscorea, Theobroma, and Tetragastris (Weir et al. 2012). Both C. siamense and C. fructicola have been isolated from strawberries, with C. siamense also isolated from other hosts.
The table provides a detailed morphological characterization of the two Colletotrichum species. It lists colony characteristics, mycelial growth rates in mm per day, conidial shape, and appressorial shape and sizes in mm for multiple isolates. For C. siamense, colonies are described as white, becoming pale brown or greenish gray, with an average mycelial growth rate of approximately 12.9 mm per day. The conidia are cylindrical with obtuse ends, and the appressoria are ovate, measuring between 4.8 and 6.0 mm. In contrast, C. fructicola colonies are gray to dark gray with age, exhibiting an average growth rate of around 13.1 mm per day. Its conidia are also cylindrical, while the appressoria are clavate to ovate, measuring 4.8 to 6.0 mm.
This table presents data on the lesion diameter and disease incidence for various Colletotrichum isolates on peach fruit. It details the mean lesion diameter in centimeters and the disease incidence percentage for each isolate. For example, isolate EY12-3 showed a mean lesion diameter of 1.49 cm with a disease incidence of 94.4%. Another isolate, SE12-1, had a mean diameter of 1.62 cm with a 100% incidence rate. The data highlight the varying degrees of virulence among the different isolates tested.
Independent experiments have shown that Colletotrichum siamense is a significant pathogen affecting blueberries in the southeastern United States. This study, along with previous research (Hu et al. 2015), supports their role as fruit pathogens in this region.
The CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences from C. siamense isolates exhibited variability. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that all isolates from our collection clustered closely around reference isolates of C. siamense (ICMP 17795, ICMP 18642, and ICMP 18121). The observed genetic variability may partly be attributed to the geographic isolation of some distinct genotypes; for instance, the OD isolates were collected 160 km apart from other isolates. Rojas et al. (2010) noted two distinct haplotype subgroups (A4-3 and A5-4) within their species concept of C. ignotum (now known as C. fructicola), a finding later confirmed by Weir et al. (2012). Collectively, these haplotype subgroups were found to be monophyletic within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Both clades include isolates from a wide range of hosts across various countries and exhibit similar cultural characteristics and morphology (Weir et al. 2012).
In our study, two isolates from group I (ICMP 18646 and ICMP 18727) and one isolate from group II (ICMP 18645)—designated as group I and group II based on the subgroups identified—were selected as references for phylogenetic analysis. Results indicated that isolates from both groups were found on peaches from South Carolina, occurring at the same location (Ridge Spring; see Figs. 1 and 2). In comparison with the previous study (Weir et al. 2012), our Maximum Parsimony (MP) and Maximum Likelihood (ML) analyses suggested that group II isolates of C. fructicola were more closely related to C. tropicale and C. aeschynomenes than to group I isolates of C. fructicola (Figs. 1 and 2). This difference may stem from the distinct nucleotide sequences employed in each phylogenetic analysis.
Fig. 4. Symptoms of infection by Colletotrichum siamense and C. fructicola on peach fruit (cv. Red Globe) after six days of incubation at room temperature. Panel A shows lesions resulting from infection by C. siamense (isolates EY12-7, EY12-2, and RR12-2 from left to right). Panel B depicts lesions caused by C. fructicola (isolates RR12-3, SE12-1, and RR12-1 from left to right).
In addition to phylogenetic analysis, we investigated morphological features, including cultural characteristics, colony growth rate, and the shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as detached fruit assays (see Table 3). The cultural characteristics of C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates were consistent with findings from previous studies (Prihastuti et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2009). Colonies of C. siamense appeared either white with gray or white with some orange, while C. fructicola colonies featured dark gray centers and white peripheral mycelium. Additionally, the size variation of conidia between our C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates aligned with the known variability within the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). Specifically, the mean length of C. siamense conidia was slightly shorter than that of C. fructicola, although the mean width of conidia from both species was nearly identical (Weir et al. 2012). Furthermore, the colony growth rate and appressorial size of C. fructicola were higher and larger, respectively, compared to those of C. siamense when cultured on PDA at 28°C in the dark, consistent with previous data (Prihastuti et al. 2009). However, differences in conidial and appressorial sizes were noted across studies. For instance, the mean length of conidia from our C. siamense isolates was 16.0 µm, while Prihastuti et al. (2009) reported a mean length of 10.17 µm, which may be due to variations in cultural conditions or differences in host sources. Yang et al. (2009) used the same C. siamense isolates as those in the Prihastuti et al. study and recorded a conidial length of 15.3 µm.
In this study, we successfully identified isolates as C. siamense, C. fructicola, or C. acutatum using our new PCR-based assay. Additional C. acutatum isolates from our collection, previously characterized by Schnabel et al. (2006), were also accurately identified (data not shown). We do not know the composition of species within the C. gloeosporioides complex from other peach production areas; therefore, this PCR assay may need validation with isolates from different geographic regions. Additionally, this identification method may not effectively distinguish C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum isolates from other hosts at the species level since both species belong to complexes that include more than 20 different species each (Damm et al. 2012a; Weir et al. 2012).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum are common causal agents of anthracnose in various fruits (Adaskaveg and Hartin 1997; Bernstein et al. 1995; Kim and Hong 2008; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Bernstein et al. (1995) identified most isolates collected from peaches in South Carolina as C. acutatum, with only one out of 19 being C. gloeosporioides. This sharply contrasts with our findings, as we only identified two C. acutatum isolates from the locations sampled (data not shown). This discrepancy may stem from our small sample size; however, a more plausible explanation is the inherent differences in fungicide sensitivity between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. Bernstein et al. (1995) found that C. acutatum strains were more resistant to benzimidazole fungicides (also known as MBC). The relative growth of C. acutatum isolates ranged from 17% to 47% at a discriminatory dose of 2 mg/ml benomyl, while none of the C. gloeosporioides isolates from peaches grew at that dose. MBC fungicides were more commonly used at the time of the Bernstein study for controlling various fruit diseases, which may have given C. acutatum a selective advantage. However, over the past two to three decades, MBC fungicides have gradually been replaced by new site-specific fungicides for disease management due to concerns over benzimidazole resistance in the major target pathogen, Monilinia fructicola (Zehr et al. 1991).
In conclusion, this study establishes the existence of two species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex responsible for causing anthracnose fruit rot in peaches in South Carolina, as documented by pathogenicity studies. Together with C. acutatum and C. truncatum, a total of four species are now recognized as causing peach anthracnose in the Southeast. A molecular assay based on GAPDH and CAL nucleotide sequences was developed and successfully used to distinguish these four species.
Figure 5 depicts the results of multiplex PCR for Colletotrichum species from peach. The Gene Ruler 100 bp DNA ladder (Thermo Scientific) is shown in lane M. In the first PCR (A), the primer pair GDF1/C-GAPDH-R produced a 359-bp fragment (lanes 1 to 6) from all four species. The forward primer CALF1 and reverse primers Cg-R and Ca-R1 produced amplicons of 649 bp (lanes 1 to 4) or 491 bp (lane 5) from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and C. fructicola) or C. acutatum, respectively. In the second PCR (B), the primer pair G3F1/C-GAPDH-R yielded a 280-bp fragment (lanes 1 to 4) from both C. siamense and C. fructicola. Primers CL1C and CALR1 produced a 550-bp fragment from C. fructicola (lanes 3 and 4) but not from C. siamense (lanes 1 and 2).
