Denoyes-Rothan, B., Guérin, G., Délye, C., Smith, B., Minz, D., Maymon, M., and Freeman, S. 2003. Genetic diversity and pathogenic variability among isolates of Colletotrichum species from strawberry. Phytopathology 93:219-228.
Ninety-five isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberry) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberry), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 sequence data provided clear genetic evidence of two subgroups in C. acutatum. The first subgroup, designated as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberry and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses.
Three species have been reported as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). These species cause similar symptoms on strawberries, including crown rot, fruit rot, and stolon lesions. In Europe, C. acutatum is the most prevalent species causing anthracnose, while C. gloeosporioides is found only occasionally, and C. fragariae has not yet been observed.
Colletotrichum spp. are currently identified using morpho-taxonomic criteria, such as morphological characters, including conidial shape and size, appressorium morphology and size, and setae morphology, as well as temperature response on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Recently, various molecular approaches have been employed to discriminate among different Colletotrichum spp. or to study the genetic diversity within these species. Some of these studies have focused on Colletotrichum spp. isolated from strawberry, distinguishing the three species pathogenic to strawberries.
Although significant progress has been made in identifying Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberries, the genetic diversity within these species has been investigated to a lesser extent.

Moreover, no correlation between genetic polymorphism and the two groups of pathogenicity has been studied. The purpose of this work was (i) to investigate genetic polymorphism and pathogenicity of C. acutatum, the major pathogen isolated from strawberry in Europe, and (ii) to determine the genetic relatedness of this pathogen to representative isolates of C. acutatum obtained from strawberry and other hosts from various countries worldwide. Additionally, isolates of C. gloeosporioides, which are occasionally observed on strawberry in Europe, were included in this work.
Fungal isolates: The 62 isolates of C. acutatum isolated from strawberry were selected from various collections representing a range of isolation dates (1978 to 1998) and geographic regions worldwide. Nineteen C. acutatum isolates from other host plants were included in the study for comparison. Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic. Additionally, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries originating from Europe and the United States, as well as one isolate from mango used as an outgroup, were studied. All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4°C as described by Perkins. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests. All isolates were identified using classical taxonomic criteria, such as conidial shape and growth on PDA.
Isolation of genomic DNA: Fungal mycelium was produced in 200 ml of liquid medium (24 g/liter of potato dextrose broth [PDB], 1 g/liter of yeast extract, and 1 g/liter of casein hydrolysate). Cultures were shaken at 100 rpm for 5 days at 27°C. Mycelium was harvested by filtration through mesh sieves (40 µm), washed with sterile water, and deposited onto Whatman paper to remove excess water. Mycelium was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and stored at –80°C. Three grams of mycelium powder was transferred to a 50-ml tube, and DNA was extracted using a method adapted from Saghai-Maroof by the addition of two chloroform/octanol phases and the addition of 10 mg/ml RNase A. DNA concentration was assessed using spectrometric measurement (GeneQuant II, Pharmacia Biotech).
PCR amplification: All 95 Colletotrichum isolates were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR).
The table summarizes the origins of 95 single spore isolates of Colletotrichum species analyzed in the study. The isolates are categorized based on their color when grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA), the corresponding RAPD genetic group, and their specific source, primarily C. acutatum from strawberry.
The isolates were collected from various countries, including France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States, with the majority originating from France. The years of collection span from 1984 to 1996. The color of the isolates on PDA varied, primarily categorized as orange or chromogenic. The genetic classification indicated that many isolates were from the CA-clonal group, with some identified as CA-variable.
Notably, there were also references to other strawberry representatives, including 138 clonal isolates from Israel. This diversity in geographical origin and genetic grouping highlights the broad distribution and potential variability within the Colletotrichum species studied.
The study utilized specific primers to amplify the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, including the 5.8S rDNA, from representative isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, chosen based on RAPD analysis. The amplification process involved an initial denaturation step at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension at specific temperatures.
Post-amplification, the products were analyzed through electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide, allowing visualization under UV light. Consistency in the results was ensured by repeating the ITS-PCR experiments multiple times.
For the sequencing procedure, PCR-amplified rDNA products were extracted from agarose gels and subjected to sequencing using the Big Dye Terminator DNA sequencing kit. This sequencing was carried out at the Molecular Biology Center in Rehovot, Israel, confirming the successful determination of the ITS2 regions.
This table lists various isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum, detailing their geographic origin, color on potato dextrose agar (PDA), and RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) genetic group. The isolates are primarily from the United States and several countries in Europe, including France, Switzerland, and Israel.
The isolates are categorized with specific identifiers (e.g., Goff, Jenkins, La30, etc.) along with their respective geographic origins, which include a mix of fruit types such as strawberry, bilberry, raspberry, and others. The color observed on PDA varies between orange and chromogenic, indicating different growth patterns. The RAPD genetic group classification includes categories like "CA-clonal" and "CA-variable," which signify genetic similarities or variations among the isolates.
In summary, the table organizes data into columns that reflect the isolate name, geographic origin, color on PDA, and genetic group, highlighting the diversity and distribution of C. acutatum across different hosts and regions.
Analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were carried out using the program package ARB. Sequence alignment was performed using the ARB automated alignment tool, followed by manual refinement. Phylogenetic analyses employed ARB's parsimony, distance matrix, and maximum-likelihood methods. The branching order was consistent across all methods. To assess the robustness of the phylogenetic trees, analyses were performed on both the original dataset and a dataset with highly variable positions removed using a 50% conservation filter for Colletotrichum species. This was done to reduce potential artifacts that may arise from multiple base changes. All sequences in this study were aligned based on 155 bases in the ITS2 region and were used for phylogenetic analysis. The analysis included sequences from representative isolates of C. acutatum from various sources: strawberry (Cha-s, France; 1267b, France; F3c, France; F3e, France; Cooley2, United States; Coll.15a, Switzerland; and TUT-5954, Israel), tomato (BJS Tomato and Tomato ARK, United States), blackberry (Coll.14a, France), raspberry (120V.211, United States), grape (Nantana A.1, United States), and bilberry (Myrtille.a, France); as well as C. gloeosporioides from strawberry (1159.5d, Spain) and several sequences previously sequenced by the authors, along with additional sequences retrieved from GenBank. As previously shown, DNA sequence analysis of the ITS2 region was more informative and displayed greater interspecies divergence than the ITS1 region alone. Complete ITS1-2 sequences of the isolates were submitted to GenBank, with accession numbers listed in the accompanying table.
Six plants of each cultivar, Belrubi and Elsanta, were inoculated with the tested isolates. For statistical analysis, the means of disease ratings from two experiments were pooled for each cultivar and isolate. Isolates of C. acutatum were classified into pathogenicity group 1 when disease ratings were similar for both cultivars, and into pathogenicity group 2 when Belrubi exhibited significantly greater resistance (disease rating < 1) compared to Elsanta (disease rating = 1), based on Student’s t-test (P = 0.05).
Table 2 presents the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 sequences of various Colletotrichum isolates used in this study. The table lists different isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, along with their respective accession numbers from GenBank. For instance, C. acutatum isolates include CBS 172.51b, IMI-080025c, and others, along with their species associations such as Fragaria × ananassa (strawberry), Malus domestica (apple), and more. The isolates are associated with unique accession numbers indicating their sequence data in GenBank. This comprehensive dataset facilitates the understanding of the diversity and relationships among different Colletotrichum species.

RAPD polymorphism was assessed using four RAPD primers to amplify DNA from 95 Colletotrichum isolates. A total of 69 reproducible RAPD fragments were obtained, with each primer yielding an average of 17 fragments, ranging in size from 450 to 3,200 base pairs (bp). Representative RAPD banding patterns obtained with primers OPC02 and OPA13 are shown in Figure 1. UPGMA cluster analysis of the 69 RAPD fragments resulted in a dendrogram (Fig. 2), where the 95 isolates clustered into two distinct groups: C. acutatum (CA) and C. gloeosporioides (CG).
Among the 81 isolates of C. acutatum, 49 fragments were identified. None of these fragments were monomorphic or specific to group CA, although one fragment was specific to all C. acutatum isolates except isolate 120V-II. Three isolates—120V-II from raspberry, Coll.14a from blackberry, and G4a from lupin—exhibited the most divergent patterns within group CA, showing 10, 5, and 5 specific fragments, respectively. Within the CA group, two subgroups were distinguished: CA-clonal, consisting of 54 isolates, and CA-variable, comprising 24 isolates. The 54 CA-clonal isolates, collected from strawberry between 1983 and 1998 in North America and Europe, displayed salmon-orange coloration in culture on PDA and clustered into a single clade, present in 100% of the bootstrap-generated trees. These isolates exhibited identical banding patterns, including a total of 11 monomorphic fragments, six of which were specific to subgroup CA-clonal, while five were also present in several isolates of subgroup CA-variable.
The 24 CA-variable isolates, collected from various host plants in North America and Europe between 1984 and 1998, are detailed in Table 1. These isolates, with the exception of F3e, F3c, and 1159-2a, exhibited a pink-chromogenic coloration in PDA culture. The RAPD patterns of the CA-variable subgroup displayed 22 fragments, eight of which were monomorphic. Five of the monomorphic fragments were specific to this subgroup. The CA-variable isolates could be separated into two subgroups, present in 99% of generated trees according to bootstrap analysis. One subgroup included all isolates from tomato (three isolates), bilberry (three isolates), and grape (one isolate) and displayed four specific fragments. The other subgroup included isolates from strawberry, peach, blackberry, dogwood, raspberry, bilberry, and apple, with two specific fragments.
The 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides displayed a total of 23 RAPD fragments, four of which were monomorphic. Among these, three monomorphic fragments were specific to this group, while one was also present in the RAPD patterns of two C. acutatum isolates (120V-II and Coll.14a). The isolate Manguier.a from mango exhibited the most divergent pattern within group CG, containing six specific fragments. Within this group, the 13 isolates from strawberry clustered into a subgroup that was present in 99% of the dendrograms generated by bootstrap analysis (Fig. 2). Within this subgroup, two Japanese isolates, Na8a and Shi1a, were the most divergent, while all four European isolates (1159.5d, 1159.5e, 9.89n1, and 9.89r2) formed a distinct subgroup supported by bootstrap analysis (75% of generated trees).

The RAPD patterns of C. gloeosporioides (CG, 3 isolates) were obtained using primers A (OPC02) and B (OPA13). Lane M indicates DNA markers in kilobases.
Fig. 2. Dendrogram generated by unweighted pair-group method with arithmetic average cluster analysis of RAPD data from 95 isolates of two Colletotrichum species, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. Numbers at major nodes indicate the frequency of the group of isolates on the left side of the node, based on a sample of 100 bootstrap-generated dendrograms. CA represents the C. acutatum group; CG represents the C. gloeosporioides group; Ca indicates C. acutatum; Ca/c indicates C. acutatum exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in potato dextrose agar culture; and Cg represents C. gloeosporioides. Host plants from the isolates are noted as follows: ap = apple; bi = bilberry; bl = blackberry; bu = blueberry; do = dogwood; gr = grape; pe = peach; ra = raspberry; st = strawberry; to = tomato; lu = lupin; and ma = mango. Scored bands are indicated by arrows.
The analysis included raspberry isolate 120V.2II from the United States; grape isolate Nantana A1 from the United States; and bilberry isolate Myrtille.a from France. The representative isolate 1159.5d of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry in Spain was also sequenced.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the ITS2 region (see Table 2; Fig. 3). A comparative analysis of ITS2 sequences produced a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 3) that supported earlier findings published by Freeman et al. (9) and Sreenivasaprasad et al. (28). Analysis of the ITS2 fragments corroborated the phylogeny inferred from the RAPD dendrogram, which separated CG isolates from CA isolates. This analysis confirmed that 24 of the C. acutatum isolates, including 12 from this study, were grouped separately from reference cultures of C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, and C. graminicola. Additionally, the ITS2 sequence analysis revealed two C. acutatum clusters that corresponded to the previously identified CA-clonal and CA-variable subgroups via RAPD-PCR (Fig. 2). The three representative CA-clonal isolates were grouped together due to nearly identical sequences, distinct from the other subgroup of CA-variable isolates, which were further divided into subsets indicating the diversity of these populations (Fig. 3). The analysis was based on the ITS2 sequences of the 12 isolates mentioned above, along with 18 additional sequences available in GenBank (see Table 2). It is important to note that sequences submitted to GenBank were not independently confirmed in this study.
Pathogenicity testing: C. acutatum isolates were assigned to pathogenicity group 1 when disease ratings were similar on cultivars Belrubi and Elsanta, or to pathogenicity group 2 when cv. Belrubi was found to be resistant (disease rating of <1), while cv. Elsanta was susceptible (disease rating of ≥1) (see Table 3). All 35 C. acutatum isolates inoculated onto strawberry caused at least one developing lesion on cv. Elsanta (disease rating of 1).
The main objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of a large representative population of Colletotrichum acutatum isolated from strawberries, comprising 62 isolates primarily from Europe and the United States. Results based on RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) and ITS2 (Internal Transcribed Spacer 2) sequence analyses provide clear genetic evidence of at least two well-characterized groups among the tested C. acutatum isolates from strawberries. The subgroup CA-clonal was homogeneous, containing isolates exclusively from strawberries that exhibited identical RAPD patterns and nearly identical ITS2 sequence data. The other, larger genetic subgroup, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts, including strawberries, that exhibited variable RAPD patterns and ITS2 sequences. These two main subgroups were well supported by bootstrap analysis of RAPD markers and sequence phylogeny.
According to RAPD analysis, isolates 120V.2II, Coll.14a, and G4a of C. acutatum could not be assigned to either of these two subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. This suggests the extreme variation already known to exist in the broad species of C. acutatum. Therefore, additional subgroups, such as that of isolate NL-12A from the ornamental anemone, may also exist. However, all tested isolates of C. acutatum, including these three exceptions, were grouped within the C. acutatum species, as confirmed by ITS2 sequence analysis.
Past studies on C. acutatum have focused more on species identification, which is of paramount importance since C. acutatum is subjected to statutory quarantine requirements, rather than on genetic diversity. However, by using mtDNA, rDNA RFLPs, and isozymes, Buddie et al. suggested the existence of one probable clonal population of C. acutatum on strawberries. Since these markers discriminate more efficiently between species than between subgroups within one species, we found it necessary to use RAPD markers to distinguish between subgroups within C. acutatum. This study confirms the existence of one CA-clonal group that is clearly distinct from other C. acutatum genetic subgroups, such as CA-variable. Additionally, the CA-clonal group, which included 54 of the 62 strawberry isolates, is the most prevalent group from this host in France, Israel, and probably in other European countries. This subgroup also includes isolates from the United States.
The larger genetic group, CA-variable, comprised eight additional C. acutatum strawberry isolates and 15 isolates from other hosts that produced orange to red chromogenic pigments. Freeman and Rodriguez suggested two genetically distinct groups that were differentiated according to their ability to produce red pigment (chromogenic). In this study, however, no clear correlation was found between genetic grouping and pigmentation, as 20 of the 23 C. acutatum isolates in subgroup CA-variable were chromogenic, whereas none of the 53 isolates within group CA-clonal possessed this trait. These results further support the existence of a polymorphic C. acutatum species, which includes the chromogenic isolates.
Clonal isolates were analyzed to confirm or reject the hypothesis of host specialization of CA-clonal isolates on strawberry. Sreenivasaprasad et al. (26) suggested that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberry are distinct from U.S. C. acutatum isolates found in a variety of hosts. In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California. Freeman and Katan (7) also observed identical RAPD patterns in pathogen isolates from both countries, suggesting that C. acutatum was introduced from the United States into Israel.
Table Description: The table presents a summary of disease ratings for various European Colletotrichum strains isolated from strawberry. It includes data on the isolates, the date of isolation, geographical origin, and genetic group classification. The isolates are categorized into two pathogenic groups: pathogenic group 1 and pathogenic group 2. For each isolate, the geographical origin and isolation date are listed, alongside their corresponding disease severity ratings on two strawberry cultivars, Belrubi and Elsanta. The disease severity is quantified on a scale from 0 to 5, where 0 indicates no symptoms and 5 indicates a dead plant. The mean disease ratings were calculated based on symptoms recorded from six plants across two experiments, and the results were pooled. This table effectively highlights the relationship between the geographic origins of the isolates and their pathogenicity levels on the tested strawberry cultivars.
For the first time, four European isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from strawberry, which have been rarely observed, were included in a study of genetic polymorphism and pathogenic variability. The RAPD patterns of all 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides showed a high level of polymorphism, as previously described. Because isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry collected in Europe and the United States were closely related genetically, it is possible that the C. gloeosporioides isolates pathogenic on strawberry were also introduced into Europe from North America through plant trade, similar to what has been suggested for C. acutatum. The dissemination of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum through plant exchanges between Europe and the United States, along with genetic and pathogenic variation within both species, could be further investigated using Californian and European isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides.
While high levels of virulence have been reported for isolates of C. gloeosporioides from the southeastern United States, European isolates collected from strawberry exhibited low virulence and could even be considered nonpathogenic. This discrepancy may be due to differences between European and southeastern United States isolates or the temperate climatic conditions in Europe. The latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that optimal growth of C. gloeosporioides in vitro occurs at higher temperatures than those for C. acutatum. Alternatively, the low virulence of C. gloeosporioides on strawberry observed in Europe could be related to limited epidemics of this species in the region.
RAPD fragments specific to different genetic groups of C. acutatum, namely CA-clonal and CA-variable, may be very useful for designing specific PCR primers for rapid and reliable detection and differentiation between the subgroups pathogenic on strawberry. This is particularly important for the detection of C. acutatum and for identifying the genetic groups CA-clonal or CA-variable in epidemiological studies. Furthermore, using additional primers or other markers such as AFLPs would increase the likelihood of detecting avirulence genes associated with pathogenic variability. This approach could help discriminate between the two pathogenicity groups within the CA-clonal group and differentiate between the highly virulent United States isolates of C. gloeosporioides and the predominantly mildly virulent isolates in Europe.
