Global food security is threatened by the emergence and spread of crop pests and pathogens. This spread is primarily facilitated by human transportation, but there is growing concern that climate change enables these organisms to establish themselves in previously unsuitable regions. However, the interactions between climate change, crops, and pests are complex. The extent to which crop pests and pathogens have altered their latitudinal ranges in response to global warming remains largely unknown. In this study, we demonstrate an average poleward shift of 2.7 ± 0.8 km per year.
The influence of weather on crop diseases has led to speculation about the effects of anthropogenic climate change on global food security. Projections are complicated by the interacting influences of increasing atmospheric CO2 concentrations, changing climatic regimes, altered frequency and intensity of extreme weather events, and differing responses of plants and their pests. However, a general pattern of increasing latitudinal range with mean global temperature is anticipated, either through direct effects of climate change on the pests or on the availability of host crops.
Latitudinal shifts in species distributions, as organisms track temperature optima, have been detected in thousands of wild populations. However, a comprehensive analysis of latitudinal range shifts of crop pests has not been attempted until now. Here, we undertake this analysis using published observations of 612 crop pests and pathogens. The data were examined for the presence of observational biases, which may arise from latitudinal gradients in the abilities of countries to detect, identify, and report pests, as well as latitudinal trends in observations for individual pest species.
Identifying reporting biases is central to the analysis of latitudinal trends in pest observations. The earliest observation for a particular pest in a specific region reflects the true date of arrival plus a delay related to observation, identification, reporting, and the selection of reliable records for inclusion in the database. In a regression of the latitude of observation against the observation date, a positive regression coefficient indicates an observed increase over time, a negative coefficient indicates a decrease, and a coefficient statistically indistinguishable from zero indicates no trend. A bias will occur if the delay period is related to latitude. Scientific and technical capacity is generally greater for countries at high latitudes, which also report more pests. Thus, countries at high latitudes are expected to report earlier than those at low latitudes, leading to a negative regression coefficient of latitude on the year of observations in the absence of any real latitudinal trend.
During the first decade of observations, two-thirds of pests were found either solely in the Northern Hemisphere (restricted above 23.4° N) or in both northern and tropical (between 23.4° S and 3.4° N) zones. Approximately one-tenth of the pests were found exclusively outside the tropics, another tenth within the tropics, while the remainder were global (present in both tropical and extra-tropical zones). Only two pests were restricted to the southern hemisphere (below 23.4° S). By the end of the observation period, more than half of the pests had a global distribution, a third were either northern or northern and tropical, and less than one-tenth were restricted to tropical or tropical and southern zones. Of those originally restricted to the tropics, more than two-thirds spread out, with most becoming global. Of those originally found outside the tropics, half were later found in the tropics.
The latitudinal range (the difference between the most northerly and most southerly known latitudes) for a pest in a given year increased roughly linearly with the longitudinal range. However, this increase occurred more rapidly over smaller ranges, such that, on average, the rate of increase was approximately equal for latitude and longitude.

Fitted values (solid line) and standard errors (dashed lines) are derived from generalized additive mixed models.
Linear mixed-effects models were fitted to detect average trends within pest species or pathotypes. For all pests combined, the mean latitudinal shifts were not significant (Supplementary Table S3), likely due to large variability among pest groups (Supplementary Tables S4 and S5). Across all years, observations of Coleoptera and Lepidoptera shifted north in the Northern Hemisphere, while Nematoda and viruses shifted south (Fig. 4). Since 1960, Acari, Coleoptera, Fungi, Hemiptera, and Lepidoptera have shifted north, while Nematoda and viruses have shifted south towards the Equator (Fig. 4). Taking multiple comparisons into account, significant trends were identified in a few pests (Supplementary Table S6). From 1960 onwards, 12 pests (ten of which were fungi) showed significant trends towards the Equator, while 17 pests (six of which were nematodes) exhibited trends away. These results indicate significant positive latitudinal shifts for many important groups of crop pests and pathogens.
Overall, there has been a significant trend of increasing numbers of pest and pathogen observations at higher latitudes globally, in both the Northern and Southern Hemispheres. The mean shift in detection since 1960 is 26.6 km per decade, which is more rapid than that reported for many wild species (17.6 km per decade; ref. 22) and nearly identical to that expected due to temperature changes (27.3 km per decade; ref. 21). Latitudinal variation in countries' abilities to report pests could bias the data towards earlier detection at higher latitudes. Consequently, the positive trends cannot be solely attributed to this potential bias. Trends in new observations may reflect increased detection probabilities at high latitudes unrelated to predictors like gross domestic product (GDP) or may result from genuine shifts in pests that have not yet been detected at lower latitudes.
Models for mean shifts within species were also fitted. Within-species shifts were significant for some groups, particularly mobile invertebrate pests such as Lepidoptera, Coleoptera, and Hemiptera, as well as for Fungi. Viruses and Nematoda showed clear observational shifts towards the Equator. Since both viruses and Nematoda lack means for airborne dispersal, their trends may be attributed to trade alone, while aerially dispersed groups exhibit poleward shifts. Other possibilities include the difficulty in identifying viruses and Nematoda in the field, as they are soil-borne, and their symptoms might be misidentified as abiotic stresses. Thus, reporting bias due to latitudinal variation in scientific and technical capacity could explain these negative trends.
It is likely that movements of wild species are hindered by habitat fragmentation, dispersal limitations, and long generation times. A climatic debt may be incurred, meaning species do not move as rapidly as expected given shifting climatic regimes. In contrast, pathogens have evolved to disperse and grow rapidly, and their spread is facilitated by global trade in seeds and agricultural produce. It is probable that anthropogenic and aerial dispersal continuously introduces pathogens to new areas.
Observed changes in pest distributions align with observations of wild species, the direct responses of pests to warming, and expectations for expanding pest ranges under climate change. Although recent climate change is considered a significant driver of these observations, other factors may influence the results. New crop varieties and agricultural technologies have extended the agricultural margin northward in the USA, while deforestation has increased production in tropical regions, creating new opportunities for pest invasions at both high and low latitudes. Correlations between land use change and climate change can obscure analyses based on species' temperature ranges. Range expansions may be biased in one direction if equatorial barriers, such as the Sahara Desert, are more restrictive to pest movement than poleward barriers like permafrost. However, randomization tests have shown that no latitudinal shift would be expected in the absence of a directional temporal trend. Although factors like land use change do affect species distributions, the impact of such confounding factors diminishes in large-scale studies, making it unlikely to detect climate signals in noisy data without real climate drivers.
Global food security relies on numerous physical, agronomic, and socioeconomic factors. However, it is clear that climate change and its effects on plant health will increasingly threaten human populations, especially those in poorer regions. We have demonstrated that reported observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens are consistent with the hypothesis of climate change drivers, as opposed to the hypothesis of enhanced detection capabilities in developed countries. While countries at higher latitudes are better equipped to monitor and manage emerging pests and diseases, they also tend to have the highest productivity per unit of land area, raising concerns about food security. If climate change facilitates the spread of crop-destroying organisms, there will be a renewed need to monitor pest and disease occurrences and control them effectively.

a. In other words, if countries at higher latitudes delay reporting longer than those at lower latitudes, it will appear as though pests arrived at higher latitudes later, leading to a potentially erroneous inference of a poleward latitudinal shift. Conversely, if countries at lower latitudes report later, a latitudinal shift towards the Equator would be inferred.
b<0. Consequently, the likely bias in observational capacity suggests that a positive latitudinal shift in observations is unlikely in the absence of a real climate change signal.
The data were tested for non-Gaussian errors and spatial autocorrelation before applying linear mixed-effects models and generalized additive mixed models to estimate latitudinal shifts in observations across the entire dataset, taxonomic groups, and individual species. Linear mixed-effects models were constructed on 1,000 randomizations of year against latitude, with pest as a random effect, to remove any temporal trend in pest observations. This approach allowed us to determine the expected latitudinal shift in the absence of a global trend, such as climate change. The latitudes of the centroids of countries or regions were utilized in the analysis. Randomization tests provided an expected latitudinal shift of...
