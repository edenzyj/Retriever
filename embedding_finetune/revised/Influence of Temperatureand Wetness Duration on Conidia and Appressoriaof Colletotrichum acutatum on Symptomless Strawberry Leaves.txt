Leandro, L. F. S., Gleason, M. L., Nutter, F. W., Jr., Wegulo, S. N., and Dixon, P. M. 2003. Influence of temperature and wetness duration on conidia and appressoria of Colletotrichum acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves. Phytopathology 93:513-520.
Strawberry leaves (cv. Tristar) inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum conidia were incubated at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C under continuous wetness, and at 25°C under six intermittent wetness regimes. The number of conidia and appressoria was quantified on excised leaf disks. To assess pathogen survival, inoculated leaves were frozen and then incubated to induce acervular development. Germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by temperature and wetness duration.
Additional Keywords: anthracnose fruit rot, phyllosphere.
The fungus was shown to survive on asymptomatic leaves of several plant species under greenhouse conditions (12). Studies suggested that symptomless foliage might play an important role in the anthracnose disease cycle, acting both as a refuge for fungal survival and as a source of inoculum for fruit and flower infections (12, 19, 33). Temperature and wetness have been reported to affect mycelial growth (1, 7, 11, 21, 37, 39), as well as the germination and sporulation of C. acutatum on agar (11), and its infection and sporulation on fruit (18, 39). However, similar studies on strawberry foliage have not been conducted. Additionally, the production of secondary conidia was not addressed in earlier research.
To develop more effective management tactics, it is necessary to understand the behavior of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves under various environmental conditions. The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the effects of temperature and intermittent wetness on the germination and secondary conidiation of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves, and (ii) assess the potential for C. acutatum to survive on symptomless strawberry leaves. A preliminary report has been published (20).
Plant Production and Maintenance: Day-neutral strawberry crowns (cv. Tristar) were planted in 15-cm-diameter plastic pots containing a 1:2:1 mixture of peat, perlite, and soil, and grown in a greenhouse at 25 ± 10°C with a 16-hour photoperiod. The plants were drip-irrigated and fertilized with a solution of a 21-5-20 fertilizer (Miracle Gro Excel, 400 ppm N) as needed. For each experiment, newly emerged leaves were tagged 7 to 14 days before inoculation to ensure uniformity in leaf age.
Inoculum Production: Isolate HF-ac-98 of C. acutatum was obtained from an infected strawberry fruit collected at the Iowa State University Horticulture Research Farm near Gilbert, IA, and transferred to silica gel for long-term storage. All cultures used for inoculum preparation were initiated by depositing infested silica gel crystals on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and culturing at 25°C in darkness until conidia developed. Conidia collected from PDA cultures were spread onto strawberry fruit agar (SFA) (19) and incubated for 7 days at 25°C in darkness. Conidial suspensions for inoculations were prepared by flooding each SFA culture plate with 9 ml of sterile deionized water (SDW), scraping with a rubber policeman to dislodge conidia, filtering through two layers of cheesecloth into a flask, and adjusting the concentration to 5 × 10^5 conidia ml⁻¹.
Temperature Experiments: Tagged strawberry leaves were excised at the petiole base and placed in moist chambers (24 × 34 × 6-cm plastic boxes containing 500 ml of SDW). Leaves were suspended above the water on a wire mesh, with the excised ends of the petioles inserted through the mesh into the water. For inoculation, the wire mesh was removed from each box, and the leaves were sprayed with a conidial suspension using an atomizer (DeVilbiss Air Compressor, 571 Series, Somerset, PA). Approximately 5 ml of conidial suspension was sprayed over a 20 × 30-cm area, resulting in an average application of 40 conidia mm⁻² of leaf area. The leaves and wire mesh were returned to the boxes, which were then sealed in plastic bags to maintain approximately 100% relative humidity. The boxes were incubated at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35°C (± 1°C) in darkness. The temperature in the incubators (Model 6; Thelco, Chicago, IL / Model I37-L; Percival, Perry, IA) was monitored and recorded every 15 minutes using WatchDog Data Loggers (Model 150; Spectrum Technologies, Plainfield, IL).
Four leaves were sampled arbitrarily from each incubator at 6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 60, 84, and 132 hours after inoculation. Two leaf disks were excised from each leaf, one on either side of the central vein of the middle leaflet, using a 1-cm-diameter cork borer. The disks were mounted on a drop of Hoyer’s medium, stained with a drop of 0.1% aniline blue in lactophenol, covered with a glass coverslip, and observed under a light microscope. The total number of germinated and ungerminated conidia was counted in each of 16 microscope fields (×400) per leaf disk. A conidium was considered germinated when it had formed either a germ tube at least as long as its width, an appressorium (a globose, septum-delimited structure formed on germ tubes or sessile to conidia), or a conidial phialide. Both unmelanized and melanized appressoria were counted. The number of conidia with a secondary conidium still attached to a conidial or hyphal phialide was quantified to estimate secondary conidiation. The total number of conidia (ungerminated + germinated) and total appressoria (unmelanized + melanized) was calculated. Data were expressed on an area basis (per square millimeter) by dividing the total number of conidia or appressoria in each leaf disk by the area of the 16 microscope fields observed per disk. Eight disks were counted at each sampling time (two disks from four leaves per sampling time), and the experiment was repeated once.
Germination and conidiation of C. acutatum were further investigated on the leaf surface of intact strawberry plants incubated at 25 ± 2°C under intermittent wetness. To establish six wet/dry treatment regimes, plants were alternated between dew chambers (Model I60DL; Percival) for the wet periods and a growth chamber (Model PGW36; Conviron, Winnipeg, Canada) for the dry periods. Treatments were defined by the ratio of dry to wet hours per day as follows: 0/24, 4/20, 8/16, 12/12, 16/8, and 24/0. The 24-hour cycles were repeated for 7 days. All plants were watered daily at the start of each cycle and kept under a 12-hour dark/12-hour light regime.
Ten plants arbitrarily assigned to each treatment were distributed within dew chambers and growth chambers according to a split-plot design with two blocks, using the day of sampling as the whole-plot treatment and wet/dry regime as the sub-plot treatment. Each plant was spray-inoculated with a conidial suspension using an atomizer until all leaves were thoroughly covered with inoculum, ensuring no runoff occurred. Following inoculation, plants were placed in dew chambers to start the wet incubation period, except for those in the continuous dry treatment, which were dried with fans for 10 to 15 minutes until no free water was observed on the leaves, then placed in the growth chamber. At the end of each wet period, plants were removed from the dew chamber, dried with fans (15 to 30 minutes), and placed in the growth chamber for the remaining dry period. Initial conidial populations on the leaves were estimated using an additional set of eight plants that were inoculated, dried, and sampled immediately after inoculation (time zero assessment). Two tagged leaves from each of two plants per treatment were sampled at the end of the 24-hour cycle on days 1, 2, 3, 5, and 7 after inoculation. Two leaf disks excised from the middle leaflet of each leaf (a total of eight disks per treatment per sampling time) were prepared for microscopic observation, and conidial and appressorial numbers were quantified as described previously. The experiment was repeated once.
Table 1. Quadratic regression analysis results for the effects of temperature on the number of germinated conidia, conidia producing secondary conidia, total conidia, and appressoria on the surface of strawberry leaves inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum and incubated under continuous wetness.
The table presents data across different incubation periods (6, 12, 18, 24, 36, 60, 84, and 132 hours) with several measured parameters. For the incubation periods, the P-value for lack of fit indicates the fit of the regression model, with values showing a consistent fit for some time points and gaps for others. The temperature optimum, expressed in degrees Celsius, shows variations in the response of different conidia types across the periods, revealing how temperature affects their germination and development. The standard error (SE) for temperature optimum highlights the precision of these estimates, with some periods missing data due to standard error exceeding 5.
The subsequent sections provide detailed values related to conidia producing secondary conidia and total conidia, highlighting significant differences between the measured parameters and how these change with temperature variations. Notably, some temperature optimum values show statistical significance indicated by asterisks, suggesting important trends in conidia development in response to temperature changes.
At the end of the table, notes clarify the statistical significance and mention that certain regression results are not reported when the standard error is too high, emphasizing the careful consideration of data quality in the analysis.
Experimental Procedure: In the experiment, plants were dried with fans, and inoculated leaves were tagged to distinguish them from newly emerging non-inoculated leaves. They were then placed on a greenhouse bench at 30 ± 10°C and drip-irrigated to avoid free moisture. Leaves from four plants per treatment were sampled at intervals of 1, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks post-transfer to the greenhouse, with an additional sampling at week 0. The sampled leaves were frozen overnight to kill the leaf tissue and incubated for 7 days at 25°C and 100% relative humidity to promote acervular development by C. acutatum. The total number of acervuli was counted on the middle leaflet of each leaf, with counts adjusted for the leaflet area measured using a leaf area meter.
Data Analysis: Quadratic regression analysis was conducted using the general linear models (GLM) procedure of SAS. Temperature optima and confidence intervals for each measurement type were estimated using Fieller’s theorem. Linear regression analysis was performed for the intermittent wetness experiment, excluding the 0-hour wetness treatment. Survival analysis on leaves was conducted using a randomized complete block design with two replications. Area under the curve (AUC) values were calculated and analyzed with Duncan’s multiple range test. Nonlinear regression analysis used SigmaPlot 2000 to explore the relationship between the number of acervuli formed after freezing and the number of appressoria at week 0. Statistical significance was set at the P < 0.05 level.
Temperature significantly influenced the production of secondary conidia on the surface of symptomless leaves. The optimum temperature for secondary conidiation ranged from approximately 21.3 to 32.7°C between 12 and 36 hours after inoculation. Secondary conidiation was rare at 10°C and at sampling times beyond 36 hours. Production of secondary conidia increased the total number of conidia on symptomless leaves, particularly at 25 and 30°C, where total conidia more than doubled during the experiment. Although the number of germinated conidia began to decrease by 60 hours, this was counterbalanced by high numbers of ungerminated conidia produced by secondary conidiation at these temperatures.
Appressoria production was favored by cooler temperatures than conidial germination and secondary conidiation. The optimum for appressorial production ranged from 17.6 to 26.5°C and decreased over time after inoculation. For instance, although appressorial production was faster at 23 to 26°C six hours post-inoculation, the largest number of appressoria was observed at 17.6 to 20.8°C after 132 hours. The least favorable temperature for appressorial production was 35°C.
Intermittent wetness affected conidial germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development at 25°C. Germination increased with the duration of wetness, and never occurred in the continuously dry treatment. The highest number of germinated conidia was observed one day post-inoculation in all treatments with eight hours of wetness per day, decreasing over time. Production of secondary conidia mainly occurred within one day after inoculation and was rare at later times. Total conidia were greater under continuous wetness than any other treatment one day post-inoculation, but tended to decrease over time.
Appressorial production increased with daily wetness duration at each sampling time, and unlike conidia, did not decrease over the experiment's duration. Wetness also affected appressorial melanization, with no melanization occurring with four hours of wetness, while treatments with 12 hours showed 90% melanization.
The number of acervuli formed on leaves after freezing and incubation decreased with time after transferring inoculated plants to the greenhouse. There were significantly more acervuli on leaves under continuous wetness compared to other treatments. In the first run, acervular numbers were significantly higher in the 16-hour wetness treatment than in those with shorter durations.
The table presents the incubation period in days alongside various statistical values, including the P value for lack of fit for different parameters related to conidia and appressoria counts. The statistical results indicate the effects of wetness duration on these parameters, where values below 0.05 (*) signify significant lack of fit.
Incubation Period (days): Values ranging from 0.90 to 24 h wet/0 h dry are shown.
P Values for Lack of Fit: Results indicate varying levels of significance across different parameters, with some treatments showing strong significance (e.g., P = 0.0017, 0.0004).
"0 h wet/24 h dry" resulted in 0.0 conidia for both runs.
"4 h wet/20 h dry" also resulted in 0.0 conidia for both runs.
"12 h wet/12 h dry" produced significantly more conidia in Run 2 (23.7) compared to Run 1 (4.4).
"24 h wet/0 h dry" had the highest conidia counts (44.8 for Run 1 and 336.6 for Run 2).
Figure 4 Description: Figure 4 illustrates the exponential relationship between the number of appressoria of Colletotrichum acutatum on strawberry leaves at the start of an 8-week survival period. It shows how this number correlates with the acervuli induced on leaves by freezing and subsequent incubation at 25°C and 100% relative humidity for various sampling times. The correlation coefficient (r² = 0.95) indicates a strong relationship between the number of appressoria on the leaves before freezing and the induced acervuli.
This study highlights that temperature and the duration of intermittent wetness significantly affect germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development of C. acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves. The optimal temperature range of 23 to 27°C for conidial germination aligns with previous findings regarding the growth of C. acutatum in culture and its impact on strawberry fruit. Increased conidial lysis at 35°C might explain the decreased conidial populations observed under continuous wetness at this temperature. Previous research on the effects of wetness duration on C. acutatum has mainly focused on strawberry fruit or in vitro studies, noting increased fruit rot incidence with longer wetness duration and reduced germination at relative humidity below 91%. In this study, longer wetness periods also favored conidial germination, which was notably low during shorter daily wetness periods of 4 hours.
Appressoria serve as infection and survival structures in Colletotrichum spp. The development of appressoria in this group of fungi is influenced by several factors, including nutrient stress, host surface characteristics, phylloplane microorganisms, temperature, and light intensity. In our study, appressorial production was favored by cooler temperatures and was severely impaired at 35°C. Similar results have been obtained on agar.
Table 3 describes the survival of Colletotrichum acutatum on strawberry leaves that were incubated at 25°C under various wet/dry treatment regimes for 7 days. Following this incubation, the leaves were maintained under dry conditions on a greenhouse bench for up to 8 weeks. The survival assessment involved freezing the leaves overnight and then incubating them at 25°C with 100% relative humidity for 7 days to stimulate the formation of acervuli. The results indicate that values followed by the same letter within columns are not significantly different (P > 0.05).
C. acutatum inoculum on transplant foliage may contribute to the effectiveness of fungicide dips used in Israel to control strawberry anthracnose (14). Although most evidence for the role of symptomless foliage as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose originates from controlled environment studies (12, 19), symptomless leaves provided sufficient inoculum to initiate fruit rot development in preliminary field trials (41). These preliminary results corroborate the relevance of our findings to the behavior of C. acutatum under field conditions.
This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26°C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.
