From the data currently available, the most common species responsible for anthracnose in apple fruits in Brazil is C. nymphaeae. In pathogenicity tests, strains of all four species caused lesions on detached apple, peach, and guava fruits, except for strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava fruits.

A new species from the Colletotrichum acutatum complex, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, was reported in this study. This species was the most commonly associated with apple fruit in Brazil. Various Colletotrichum species are linked to fruits in Brazil.
Keywords: Identification; multilocus phylogeny; pathogenicity; plant pathogenic fungus; systematics.
Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, particularly in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts (Sutton 1992). The typical symptoms of Colletotrichum infections include sunken necrotic lesions, often bearing orange conidial masses, referred to as anthracnose (Freeman et al. 1998). The impact of these pathogens on fruit crops is significant, causing severe yield losses; for example, bitter rot is one of the most critical diseases affecting apple fruit, potentially leading to yield losses of up to 50% (Sutton 1990).
Before the molecular era, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species was primarily based on morphological and cultural characteristics, including conidia size and shape, presence or absence of setae, colony color, and growth rate (von Arx 1957; Sutton 1980, 1992). However, these characteristics can be unreliable for species differentiation due to variability under changing environmental conditions (Cai et al. 2009).
Recently, more focus has been placed on conidium morphology, particularly shape and dimensions. The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013). The revision of the C. acutatum complex has recognized 31 species through a multilocus molecular approach, significantly advancing our understanding of these plant pathogens (Damm et al. 2012).
Colletotrichum fioriniae, C. pyricola, and C. salicis (Guerber et al. 2003; Damm et al. 2012) were identified as the primary strains responsible for bitter rot in apples in Croatia. Most of these strains were identified as C. fioriniae, with some classified as C. clavatum (a synonym of C. godetiae) based on ITS sequences (Ivic et al. 2012). The first report of apple bitter rot in the United Kingdom was also linked to C. godetiae (Baroncelli et al. 2014). One strain shared the same ITS sequence as strains BBA 65797 and IMI 345581, the latter of which had previously been identified as C. salicis by Damm et al. (2012). However, it is important to note that related species may exhibit identical ITS sequences, as this locus is not always informative at the species level within the C. acutatum species complex. Other strains from apples in Europe included in the study by Damm et al. (2012) were also identified as C. fioriniae and C. godetiae. In contrast, strains from apples in Japan, identified by Sato and Moriwaki (2013) through a multilocus analysis, were found to belong to C. nymphaeae and C. godetiae. Similarly, strains from bitter rot of apple in Korea, as studied by Lee et al. (2007), likely belong to C. fioriniae and a species within the C. acutatum clade 2 (which includes C. nymphaeae and related species) according to Damm et al. (2012). Previously isolated strains from apples and other fruits in Brazil that belong to the C. acutatum species complex were identified only as C. acutatum s. lat. (González et al. 2006; Giaretta et al. 2010). If sequences of these strains were generated at all, only ITS sequences are available on GenBank, which do not permit accurate species identification within this complex. As a result, the name C. acutatum is still used broadly in Brazil (Serra et al. 2011; De Souza et al. 2013; Barquero Quirós et al. 2013; Ciampi-Guillardi et al. 2014). To date, only a few species within the C. acutatum species complex have been identified in Brazil, including a report of C. nymphaeae causing apple bitter rot in southern Brazil (Velho et al. 2014). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify Colletotrichum strains associated with various fruit crops from different localities in Brazil, utilizing both multilocus molecular techniques and morphological data, and to describe the new species encountered.
A total of 17 Colletotrichum strains, isolated from anthracnose symptoms on apple, peach, and guava fruits from various localities in Brazil and tentatively identified as C. acutatum s. lat. based on conidial morphology, were included in this study. The type material of the new species recognized in this study was deposited in the fungarium of the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (CBS) in Utrecht, The Netherlands. Subcultures of the ex-type and other isolates used for morphological and sequence analyses are maintained in the culture collections of the CBS and CPC (personal collection of Pedro Crous) in Utrecht, The Netherlands, as well as in the Colletotrichum collection of the Mycology laboratory at the Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz” in Piracicaba, Brazil.
Sequencing was performed using the BigDye Terminator Sequencing Kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems, USA) and an ABI PRISM® 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). The forward and reverse sequences generated were assembled using the software SeqMan v.9.0.4 (DNASTAR®, Madison, USA). Sequences from 59 ex-type and other reference strains of species belonging to the C. acutatum complex, along with C. orchidophilum CBS 632.80 (as an outgroup), all available on GenBank, were added to the dataset. The sequences were aligned using MAFFT v.6.7 (Katoh & Toh 2008), and the multiple sequence alignment was manually edited with MEGA v.5.2 (Tamura et al. 2011).
Evolutionary models were estimated in MrModeltest v.3.7 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) using the Akaike Information Criterion (AIC) for each locus. Bayesian inference was employed to reconstruct the phylogeny based on the multilocus alignment (ITS, HIS3, GAPDH, CHS-1, TUB2, and ACT). The partitioned analysis was performed twice in MrBayes v.3.2 (Ronquist et al. 2003) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). Four MCMC chains were run simultaneously for random trees for 10 million generations, with samples taken every 1,000 generations. The first 25% of trees were discarded as burn-in, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees.
Sequences derived in this study were uploaded to GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), the alignment was deposited in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html), and taxonomic novelties were recorded in MycoBank (www.mycobank.org, Crous et al. 2004a).
Strains were cultivated on synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976) with autoclaved filter paper and stems of Anthriscus sylvestris placed on the surface, as well as on oatmeal agar medium (OA; Crous et al. 2009). The cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements of morphological characters were made according to Damm et al. (2007). Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure taken for each strain using a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope (DM) and a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. Appressoria were observed on the reverse side of the plates containing SNA medium. Unless otherwise noted, descriptions are based on the ex-type strains, and only conidia from conidiomata were included in the morphological examination.
Colony characteristics on SNA and OA media were observed after the incubation period. To calculate growth rates, the diameters of colonies were measured after 7 and 10 days. Colony colors were determined according to Rayner (1970).
To determine whether the species identified in this work differ in virulence or aggressiveness, a pathogenicity test was conducted by inoculating physiologically mature fruits of peach (Prunus persica cv. ‘Chimarrita’), apple (Malus domestica cv. ‘Gala’), and guava (Psidium guajava cv. ‘Pedro Sato’). The fruits were treated using a specific method (Masinsotan and others, model 53200, Japan) and then subjected to the inoculation process. Prior to inoculation, the fruits were immersed in a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 minutes, rinsed twice in sterile distilled water, and air-dried in a laminar flow cabinet.
The fruits were placed in a plastic box with a lid containing water-soaked cotton wool. They were inoculated by wounding the fruits with a sterile needle and applying 40 µL of spore suspension to the wound. Control fruits were inoculated with sterile distilled water. The plastic boxes were kept in an incubation room at 25 °C with a 12-hour photoperiod. After 48 hours, the lids of the boxes were removed, and the boxes remained in the room for an additional 5 days. On the 7th day, the lesion size was measured, and the fungus was re-isolated from the margin of the lesion.
The experimental design was randomized, using 10 fruits as replicates. Lesion length data were subjected to analysis of variance using the statistical program “R” version 3.0.1 (R Core Team 2013), and the means of each treatment were compared using Tukey’s test at a 95% probability level.
The molecular analysis of 76 isolates of C. acutatum s. lat. and the outgroup (C. orchidophilum, strain CBS 632.80) was performed on a sequence alignment with 2222 characters, of which 1702 were conserved, 200 were parsimony-uninformative, and 320 were parsimony-informative. The gene boundaries were specified as follows: w14e8re3:–I1T9S7:41, –A5C4T9,: H19IS735:–525202–29. Models were selected for the partitioned Bayesian inference: GTR+G for ACT and GAPDH, HKY+G for TUB2, K80+I+G for CHS-1, GTR+I+G for HIS3, and GTR+I for ITS.
The phylogenetic tree, which includes Bayesian posterior probability values, exhibits five main clades with over 30 subclades, most of which represent previously defined species of the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). The majority of the strains from fruits in Brazil grouped in clade 2, alongside the ex-epitype strain of C. nymphaeae, which was well-supported by a Bayesian posterior probability value (BPP) of 1.0, although it exhibited high intraspecific variability. Within C. nymphaeae, one strain from guava (CPC 20893) and all strains from apple in Brazil, including one from a previous study (IMI 370491), formed an intraspecific subclade with a BPP value of 0.99.
All other strains studied grouped in clade 1. Among these, two strains from apple in Brazil (CBS 134730, Col 20) grouped with the ex-holotype strain of C. melonis (CBS 159.84). However, within C. melonis, strains Col 20 and CBS 159.84 formed a sister clade (BPP of 1.0) to strain CBS 134730. Strain CBS 134729, also from apple in Brazil, grouped with a strain from Caryocar, also from Brazil, which had been treated as Colletotrichum sp. in a previous study (Damm et al. 2012). A third strain, CBS 134728 from Prunus, also grouped (BPP of 0.97) with this clade, which was recognized as a new species named C. paranaense. Strain CBS 134727 from Psidium grouped with two isolates previously described as causal agents of postbloom fruit drop (PFD) of sweet orange in Florida, USA (Peres et al., 2008), and with a strain from sweet orange isolated in Brazil and recently described as C. abscissum (Crous et al. 2015).
Colletotrichum cf. melonis (Fig. 2) was treated as a separate entity, while the strain CBS 134727 was recognized as a new species described by Pinho and Pereira (2015).
The structures are smooth-walled, aseptate, and vary from cylindrical to clavate in shape, with both ends acute, and sometimes one end rounded. Their dimensions range from (7–)9–13(–16) x (3–)3.5–4.5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.1 ± 2.2 x 3.9 ± 0.5 µm, and a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 2.8. Appressoria are typically single, medium to pale brown, and can be bulbous to clavate or occasionally globose to obovoidal, with edges that may be entire or lobate. Their sizes range from (4.5–)6–14.5(–20.5) x (4–)4.5–6(–7) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.4 ± 4.1 x 5.4 ± 0.7 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.9.
The asexual form occurs on the stem of Anthriscus. The conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores formed on a cushion of pale brown angular cells. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, septate, branched, and can reach lengths of up to 35 µm. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to obclavate, measuring 8.5–15.5 x 3–3.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, and a collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, exhibiting visible periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical with both ends acute and sometimes one end rounded, measuring (8–)11.5–15(–17.5) x (2.5–)4–5(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.3 ± 1.6 x 4.4 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.0.
Colonies grown on SNA are flat with entire edges, hyaline to buff, and the Anthriscus stem is partly covered by a white floccose aerial mycelium and an orange conidia mass. The reverse side exhibits similar colors, with a growth rate of 22.5–23 mm in 7 days and 34–34.5 mm in 10 days. On OA, colonies appear slightly umbonate with entire edges, saffron to olivaceous grey, almost completely covered by an orange conidia mass and partially obscured by floccose pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium. The reverse is salmon-colored, with a growth rate of 20.5–21 mm in 7 days and 32–32.5 mm in 10 days.
Specimens were collected from Brazil, specifically Rio Grande do Sul, from fruit anthracnose of Malus domestica, identified as S. Alves (living culture CBS 134730 = CPC 20912 = Col 31).
Strain CBS 134730 exhibited morphological differences compared to the original strain. Conidiophores from C. cf. melonis on SNA were unbranched and not degenerating, with conidiogenous cells often constricted at the base and smaller in size. In contrast, C. melonis features branched and rapidly degenerating conidiophores, with no mention of constriction in conidiogenous cells. The conidia from C. cf. melonis were frequently acute at both ends, a rarity in C. melonis, showing a smaller L/W ratio and larger appressoria.
Strain CBS 134730 formed a sister clade with strains Col 20 and CBS 159.84, which is the ex-holotype strain of C. melonis. Although the TUB2, ACT, and HIS3 sequences from strain CBS 134730 showed 99% identity to those of C. melonis strain CBS 159.84 in GenBank searches, none were identical, differing in 4, 1, and 3 nucleotides, respectively. The GAPDH and ITS sequences of strain CBS 134730 matched those of Colletotrichum strain CBS 129823 from Passiflora edulis perfectly, while its CHS-1 sequence matched 100% with JQ948841 from strain CBS 330.75 from Coffea arabica, the ex-holotype strain of C. costaricense (Damm et al. 2012). Despite these sequence differences, we do not classify strain CBS 134730 as a new species, given it is only represented by a single strain, and it is possible that intermediate strains exist between Col 20 and CBS 134730, as both were isolated from apples in Brazil.

Specimens examined: BRAZIL, Paraná, from fruit anthracnose of Malus domestica, 2010, L. Mio (CBS H-21122 holotype, culture ex-holotype CBS 134729 = CPC 20901 = Col 19); from Caryocar brasiliense, collection date and collector unknown (isolated by J.R.N. Anjos, deposited in CABI 25 July 2000), living culture IMI 384185 = CPC 18937 = CPAC 8; São Paulo, Paranapanema, from fruit anthracnose of Prunus persica, 2010, H. Tozze, culture CBS 134728 = CPC 20928 = Col 49.
In contrast, C. costaricense showed longer and branched conidiophores, a greater L/W ratio, and observed conidia that were larger, with appressoria found in small groups. Setae were also observed, while conidiomata were not developed. C. melonis exhibited branched and rapidly degenerating conidiophores, with visible periclinal thickening. Polyphialides were not observed, and conidia were smaller and rarely acute at both ends.
134729 and IMI 384185 have unique sequences showing two different nucleotides compared to the dataset used in this study.
The sexual morph was not observed. The asexual morph was found on SNA. The vegetative hyphae are 2–3.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores were formed directly on the hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiogenous cells are smooth-walled, elongate-ampulliform, sometimes attenuated at the base, measuring 12–15 x 2.5–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1 µm in diameter and a pale brown collarette 1 µm long, showing visible periclinal thickening.
Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and cylindrical, with both ends rounded, and occasionally one end acute, measuring (10.5–)12–14.5(–16) x (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm. The mean ± SD is 13.2 ± 1.5 x 3.7 ± 0.4 µm, with a length/width ratio of 3.6. Appressoria are single, pale to medium brown, obovoidal, ellipsoidal, or clavate, with undulate to lobate edges, measuring (6–)7–12.5(–21) x (4.5–)5–6.5(–7.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.8 ± 2.9 x 5.9 ± 0.7 µm, and a length/width ratio of 1.7.
The asexual morph was found on the stem of Anthriscus. Conidiomata were acervular, and conidiophores were formed on hyaline to pale brown, angular basal cells measuring 5.5–6.5 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 35 µm long. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with one end acute, and sometimes both ends acute, measuring (8.5–)12–16(–17) x (3–)4–4.5(–5) µm. The mean ± SD is 14 ± 1.9 x 4.3 ± 0.5 µm, with a length/width ratio of 3.3.
Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire edge, buff in color, and filter paper is partly covered by olivaceous felty aerial mycelium. The stem of Anthriscus is partly covered by felty aerial mycelium and is partly orange due to the conidia mass, with the reverse displaying the same colors. The growth rate is 21–22.5 mm in 7 days and 31–32.5 mm in 10 days. Colonies on OTA are flat to umbonate with an entire edge, olivaceous to pale olivaceous, and partly covered by white to olivaceous grey floccose-felty aerial mycelium, with a reverse that is pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey. The growth rate on OTA is 17–17.5 mm in 7 days and 28–28.5 mm in 10 days. Conidia in mass are saffron-colored.
BRAZIL, Paraná, Cafelândia, from fruit anthracnose of Psidium guajava, 2008, H. Tozze (CBS H-21121, culture CBS 134727 = CPC 20894 = Col 10).
Colletotrichum abscissum was described by Pinho et al. from Citrus sinensis, causing postbloom fruit drop in Brazil (Crous et al. 2015). Two strains examined by the authors grouped in a well-supported clade with the ex-type strain COAD 1877. Differences were found between the original strain described by Pinho & Pereira (2015) and the strain described in this study. The original strain did not show...
Brazil shares the same ITS sequence as C. guajavae (Damm et al., 2012). Another Colletotrichum species affecting guava, C. psidii, was described in Italy and belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al., 2012).
All tested strains were able to infect their original host and all other included hosts, except for the C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava fruits (Table 2). No lesions were formed on control fruits. However, there were differences in the size of the lesions and the frequency of infected fruits. None of the strains formed larger lesions on their original host compared to other hosts.
All strains tested formed large lesions on all inoculated peach fruits; however, their infection frequency and lesion size on guava and apple varied. Colletotrichum melonis (Col 20) caused larger lesions on peach than C. paranaense (CBS 134728), C. abscissum (CBS 134727), and C. nymphaeae (CPC 20897). C. abscissum showed no difference in lesion size between peach and guava. This strain infected only one apple, and the lesion size was smaller than those caused by most other strains tested. Colletotrichum melonis strain Col 20 infected all inoculated guava fruits, while C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730 infected only peach and apple. Additionally, C. nymphaeae strain CPC 20897 formed smaller lesions on guava fruits than C. paranaense strain CBS 134728.
A large number of Colletotrichum species belonging to the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes were recently differentiated, with some associated with fruit diseases in apples, including bitter rot (Damm et al., 2012). Studies have demonstrated high genetic variability among strains causing apple bitter rot in Brazil (González et al., 2006; Giaretta et al., 2010). Based on ITS sequences, Giaretta et al. (2010) differentiated strains from bitter rot of apple into five main clades, indicating the disease is caused by several species within the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes. Our study on C. acutatum s. lat. strains from fruits in Brazil identified strains mainly originating from the USA as C. fioriniae, with a few strains identified as C. acerbum, C. godetiae, C. salicis, and C. nymphaeae. The latter seems to be more important on other hosts, especially strawberries. The only C. nymphaeae strain from apple included in Damm et al. (2012) was also the only strain from apple in South America in their study, originating from Brazil. Velho et al. (2014) tested strains of this species collected in southern Brazil that caused apple bitter rot. Our study suggests C. nymphaeae to be the most important species of the complex.
These subclades show few base pair differences. We refrain from describing further species within C. nymphaeae. While the majority of the strains were identified as C. nymphaeae, other strains, including the newly described species C. paranaense and C. melonis, are part of a main clade within the C. acutatum species complex (indicated as main clade 1 in Damm et al. 2012). This clade comprises closely related species predominantly found on various hosts in Central and South America, distinguished primarily by GAPDH and TUB2 sequences. For instance, C. lupini was originally described as G. sorghicola. Some strains from apple in this study were identified as C. melonis and the new species, C. paranaense. ITS sequences place the remaining strains from apple in Brazil, as noted in Giaretta et al. (2012), in the same main clade, though species-level identification is not possible based solely on this data. No species in this clade was previously associated with diseases of apple, peach, or guava fruits, and none of the other four species of the C. acutatum complex reported by Damm et al. (2012) from other regions were found associated with apples in Brazil. The species composition of the C. acutatum complex linked to apple bitter rot in Brazil appears distinct from other global regions, which may be significant for plant quarantine.
Strain CBS 134727 of C. abscissum grouped with strains causing citrus postbloom fruit drop. This strain was collected from guava fruit with anthracnose in a commercial orchard in Cafelândia. Previous studies revealed its pathogenicity to citrus, causing postbloom fruit drop in 70% of inoculated flowers (Ramiro et al., unpublished data). Guava volatiles repel Diaphorina citri, the vector of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), making guava intercropping a strategy to control HLB (Beattie et al., 2006). However, the ability of guava to host C. abscissum has significant epidemiological implications for citrus postbloom fruit drop outbreaks. All strains tested for pathogenicity on fruits were able to infect various hosts, though they varied in aggressiveness. Studies have shown a lack of host specificity among Colletotrichum species infecting fruits (Peres et al. 2002; MacKenzie et al. 2009; Lakshmi et al. 2011; Phoulivong et al. 2012; de Souza et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2013; Baroncelli et al. 2015). Many Colletotrichum species associate with different hosts, and one host can be affected by multiple species (Damm et al. 2012, 2014; Weir et al. 2012). In a study by MacKenzie et al. (2009), genetically distinct strains of C. acutatum (s. lat.) from strawberry, blueberry, citrus, and fern exhibited pathogenicity and varied in aggressiveness, with the highest incidence and largest lesions on their original host. Based on TUB2 sequences, Damm et al. (2012) linked the strains from strawberry to others.
Regarding the species isolated from apples, none appeared to be specific to apple fruits. Based on our pathogenicity data, all of them can potentially infect peach and guava, except for the C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava at all. There is no difference in virulence among the three species tested on apple. Colletotrichum nymphaeae was recently identified among strains in the NIAS Genbank from multiple hosts, including several strains from apple and peach in Japan (Sato & Moriwaki, 2013). This species caused lesions on fruits of all three hosts tested and apparently also occurs on all of them in nature. Although C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae have a large host range with some overlapping hosts, there could still be differences in pathogenicity and aggressiveness.
Pathogenicity was also observed on guava in this study, and future research will determine if C. paranaense occurs on this host in nature. Understanding the cross-infection ability of a species is crucial for investigating its potential host range and supporting quarantine measures (Phoulivong et al., 2012). The plurivorous nature of the species identified in this study may contribute to the cross-pathogenicity of the tested strains. Additionally, the inoculation technique and incubation conditions used in the pathogenicity tests may create conditions more favorable for infection than those typically found in nature. While wound infection is a common practice in pathogenicity tests on fruits (Cai et al., 2009; Peng et al., 2013), it could influence the virulence of the strains. For instance, inoculation experiments by von Arx and van der Velden (1961) showed that the number of fruit hosts infected by C. orbiculare and "Glomerella cingulata" (likely C. gloeosporioides s. lat.) was significantly higher following wound inoculation compared to non-wounded conditions.
The Bayesian tree obtained in this study indicates high genetic variability among the species occurring in Brazil, which is important for developing control strategies. A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides. Accurate identification of pathogens enhances our understanding of their epidemiology and infection strategies, providing valuable knowledge for breeding resistant cultivars.

Figure 1: A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree was reconstructed from a combined alignment of ITS, HIS3, GAPDH, CHS-1, BTU2, and ACT sequences from 76 isolates of the C. acutatum species complex, including an outgroup. Bayesian posterior probability (BPP) values and bootstrap values (above 0.85 or 85) are indicated at the nodes, with thickened nodes representing a BPP of 1. Isolates from this study are highlighted in red font, while ex-type cultures are indicated in bold font. New species are denoted with green boxes. C. orchidophilum CBS 632.80 is used as the outgroup. Main clades within the C. acutatum species complex, as outlined by Damm et al. (2012), are marked in red and numbered 1 to 5. The scale bar represents the number of expected changes per site.
Figure 2: The illustration depicts Colletotrichum cf. melonis (from strain CBS 134730). It includes images of conidiomata, conidiophores, angular cells, appressoria, and conidia, showing different structures under various microscopy methods. Scale bars indicate the sizes of the structures, with 100 µm for larger structures and 10 µm for smaller ones.
Figure 3: This figure showcases Colletotrichum paranaense (from ex-holotype strain CBS 134729). It presents images of conidiomata, conidiophores, angular cells, appressoria, and conidia, with appropriate scales noted.
Figure 4: Depicts Colletotrichum abscissum (from strain CBS 134727). It features images of conidiomata, conidiophores, appressoria, and conidia, again with noted scale bars.
Table 2: The table presents a pathogenicity test of various Colletotrichum species on peach, guava, and apple fruits. It lists the species, strain, original host, lesion sizes (in mm²), and frequency of infection (number of infected fruits over total inoculated). The results show the varying effectiveness of different Colletotrichum species on the three fruit types, with statistical letters indicating significant differences in lesion size and infection frequency within and between species.
