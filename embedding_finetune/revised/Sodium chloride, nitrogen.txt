Abstract: Media and nutrient variables were investigated to develop methods for reducing the incidence and severity of Fusarium crown rot caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. f. sp. radicis-lycopersici Jarvis & Shoemaker (FORL), which poses a significant challenge for tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) cultivation. Root-dip inoculated seedlings were transplanted into trays filled with a 1:1 mixture of Canadian peat and vermiculite. These media were prepared using factorial combinations of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) at rates of 0.75 or 3.0 kg·m⁻³, calcium nitrate [Ca(NO₃)₂] or ammonium sulfate [(NH₄)₂SO₄] (each providing 225 mg N/liter), and sodium chloride (NaCl) at either 0 or 2000 mg Na/liter as experimental treatments.
Crown rot severity increased with the lower CaCO₃ rate, the use of (NH₄)₂SO₄, and the addition of supplemental NaCl. Data on the fresh weight of seedlings, expressed as percentage values relative to non-inoculated controls, supported observations regarding the impact of Fusarium crown rot on tomato seedlings. Some Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) isolates may attack the roots aggressively, while others act as weak pathogens. This disease has been a notable issue in Florida (Jones et al., 1990) and is also recognized in greenhouse and field settings elsewhere (Brammall and McKeown, 1989; Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980; Vakalounakis, 1988).
The selected seedling culture medium for this research was intentionally very acidic, with a pH ranging from 4.0 to 5.7. Previous findings (Jones et al., 1990) indicate that an acidic reaction is crucial for the rapid expression of the disease. Field experiences have correlated low soil pH with increased severity and incidence of the disease caused by FORL. Florida's pine-palmetto flatwood soils typically have an initial very acidic pH (approximately 3.8), and standard liming procedures do not effectively raise the pH quickly or uniformly. Soil sampling reveals the presence of both acidic and moderately pH-elevated regions. Additionally, spot samples, aside from customary tests, show that both limed and unlimed conditions can persist in the soil for an extended period following liming. Consequently, individual tomato plants may have some roots in strongly acidic zones while others are surrounded by more neutral conditions.

Sodium chloride was selected as a variable because commercial tomato growers and workers in agricultural fields reported that high soil NaCl levels were frequently associated with the development of more severe and extensive outbreaks of crown rot. Additionally, Davet et al. (1966) reported that fusarium wilt of tomato is aggravated by high NaCl content in irrigation water. Undesirably elevated soil NaCl levels are occasionally encountered by tomato growers in various regions of the United States.
Earlier research has led to a system for controlling or reducing tomato fusarium wilt disease (Davet et al., 1966; Woltz and Jones, 1968, 1973, 1981). We attempted to apply and extend these findings to crown rot (Jones et al., 1990), given that the two Fusaria belong to the same species.
Two-week-old seedlings of the ‘Walter’ tomato variety were root-dip inoculated in Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) inoculum prepared by blending potato glucose agar cultures in sterile deionized water, diluting to a final concentration of 5 × 10^6 spores per milliliter. The root dip also involved crowns and a portion of the hypocotyl. The inoculated seedlings, 15 per container, were transplanted into plastic trays measuring 18.5 × 24.5 × 2.5 cm, containing approximately 0.002 m³ of a mix of 1 part Canadian peat to 1 part vermiculite. The medium was amended with 1.5 kg of a Perk micronutrient mix (Vigoro Industries, Fairview Heights, Ill.) and 3.0 kg of single superphosphate per cubic meter. Factorial combinations of powdered CaCO3 (0.75 or 3.0 kg·m³), solutions of Ca(NO3)2 or (NH4)2SO4 (each at 225 mg N/liter), and NaCl at either 0 or 204 mg Na/liter were used as experimental treatments. Calcium carbonate was included in the dry mix, while 200 ml of solutions of the nitrogen sources and NaCl were applied to the trays before planting the inoculated or non-inoculated seedlings. This application was repeated weekly until the end of the experiment.
The experiment was conducted in a greenhouse in November and December 1990, following a completely randomized block design. Daytime temperatures ranged from 18 to 26°C, with nighttime temperatures between 17 and 21°C. Lower temperatures (22 to 24°C) are essential for the rapid and uniform development of crown rot (Jones et al., 1990). Statistical analysis was performed using analysis of variance and t-tests (LSD) comparing equal cell sizes with pairwise t-tests (SAS Institute, 1985).
Crown rot developed rapidly, initially manifesting as a breaking of the hypocotyl, followed by wilting, necrosis of the leaves, and death of the seedlings. In young seedlings (10 to 14 days), the expression was characterized by a collapse of the hypocotyls. Older seedlings (14 to 28 days) displayed girdling of the crown, rated according to the severity of the effect. Calcium carbonate at the higher rate inhibited the development of crown rot, as indicated by disease ratings and fresh weight data of inoculated seedlings expressed as percentages of the appropriate non-inoculated control plants.
As the nitrogen source, Ca(NO3)2 reduced crown rot severity compared to (NH4)2SO4. Supplemental NaCl increased disease severity in comparison to the absence of extra NaCl. The combination of low CaCO3, (NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source, and added NaCl produced the most severe disease expression. A very low medium pH (approximately 4.0) was associated with increased disease incidence. High sodium and low calcium contents in a 1 part medium to 2 parts water extract correlated with higher severity of disease.
The combination of ammonium (NH₄) and sodium chloride (NaCl) can provide a high degree of protection against crown rot disease. The data presented here for nitrogen sources do not differentiate between the effects of nitrate and ammonium but include the effects of calcium and sulfate. The effectiveness of fertilization practices in preventing diseases would likely be much greater under normal conditions of low inoculum potential, with no intentional wounding of roots, crowns, and hypocotyls. However, confirmation of these findings requires application in commercial practices.
