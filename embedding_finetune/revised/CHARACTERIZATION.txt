Filamentous fungi of the genus Colletotrichum and its teleomorph Glomerella are considered major plant pathogens worldwide. They cause significant economic damage to crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by these pathogens. Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as anthracnose, characterized by sunken necrotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases can appear in both developing and mature plant tissues.
Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has categorized Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly appear on aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.
In this article, we focus on methods used to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species and genotypes from almond, avocado, and strawberry, using traditional and molecular tools. The three pathosystems chosen represent different disease patterns of fruit-associated Colletotrichum.
Numerous cases have been reported in which several Colletotrichum species or biotypes are associated with a single host. For example, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph: Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), which is considered a cumulative species and forms the sexual stage in some instances, is predominantly found as a postharvest disease affecting fruits such as avocado and mango. Strawberry may be infected by three Colletotrichum species: C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, causing anthracnose of fruit and other plant parts. Similarly, C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds has been reported to infect a large number of fruit crops, including avocado, strawberry, almond, apple, and peach. Citrus can be affected by four different Colletotrichum diseases: postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose, both caused by C. acutatum, as well as shoot dieback and leaf spot, and postharvest fruit decay, both caused by C. gloeosporioides. Other species with multiple host ranges include C. coccodes, C. capsici, and C. dematium.
Due to the complex situations described, diagnostics and etiology of Colletotrichum are critical.
Table 1 compares two populations of Colletotrichum isolated from almond fruit in Israel and California. It likely presents various parameters such as species identification, morphological characteristics, pathogenicity levels, or genetic markers that differentiate the populations. The focus is on highlighting any significant differences or similarities in these populations, which may impact their management in agricultural practices. Specific metrics or findings from the study, including prevalence rates and host interactions, might be included to illustrate the ecological and agricultural relevance of these Colletotrichum populations.
Benomyl Sensitivity Assessment Benomyl sensitivity based on fungicide disk assays indicates various resistance levels. Additional testing revealed that isolates from California were not vegetatively compatible with those from Israel, and that California isolates were distinct based on arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR). For further context, benomyl sensitivity was also assessed at a concentration of 5 Âµg/ml.
Disease Etiology and Host Specificity Determining the specific species of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose is critical for effective disease management. Relying solely on the species-host combination can be misleading. Therefore, taxonomic identification and characterization of subpopulations are essential to establish a clear understanding of disease dynamics.
Differentiating between species is particularly important because different pathogens may affect various plant tissues. For instance, C. acutatum can cause postbloom drop in citrus, while C. gloeosporioides primarily affects harvested fruit. Accurate identification aids in developing resistance strategies and understanding pathogen interactions across different geographical regions.
Host Range and Specificity Some Colletotrichum species exhibit extensive host ranges, while others are more specific. Certain strains, such as C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum, infect a broad range of hosts, whereas others, like C. dematium, may have more restricted host interactions. These characteristics are vital for the development of commercial mycoherbicides aimed at controlling specific weeds like northern jointvetch.
Table Comparison Summary A comparison of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado reveals differences in morphology and compatibility. Notably, the optimal growth temperature and growth rate on potato dextrose agar varied between isolates. The infected plant parts included leaves, twigs, and both immature and mature fruit, with some isolates showing compatibility and others absent. Additionally, benomyl sensitivity differed among isolates, highlighting the importance of molecular characterization in disease management.
Figure Description Figure 1 illustrates typical anthracnose symptoms caused by C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. Symptoms include lesions on immature almond fruit, wilting of leaves due to infection, and signs on mature avocado and strawberry fruit. Arrows in the figure indicate areas of sporulation, demonstrating the pathogen's impact on the fruits.
The characteristics of conidia, including color, size, and shape, as well as optimal temperature, growth rate, presence or absence of setae, and existence of the teleomorph Glomerella, play crucial roles in differentiating species of the Colletotrichum genus. This discussion focuses on three anthracnose pathosystems affecting the fruits of almond, avocado, and strawberry, which exhibit different disease patterns.
In the case of almond, a deciduous crop, anthracnose pathogens typically infect during the early fruiting stages, but do not attack mature fruit or other plant parts. Conversely, avocado, an evergreen crop, experiences postharvest decay caused by latent or quiescent infections initiated in the field. Unlike almond and avocado, which are perennial, strawberry is primarily an annual crop. Strawberry anthracnose, caused by species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae, leads to significant damage to both foliar and fruiting parts, as well as root necrosis. The damage to strawberry crops is not confined to a specific growth period or storage conditions; anthracnose can appear throughout the season.
Over the past decade, various molecular techniques have been employed to enhance the reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species. These methods include arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR) and polymorphisms in nuclear DNA, ribosomal DNA (rDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and A+T-rich DNA. Although almond and avocado crops are grown in close proximity in Israel, where anthracnose from C. gloeosporioides affects both crops during the spring season, it remains uncertain whether cross-infection occurs in the field. Additionally, strawberry, which is also susceptible to C. acutatum, is cultivated in the same regions and climatic conditions as the avocado and almond crops.
Recent analyses using CHEF gel and molecular markers on Australian isolates of C. gloeosporioides have revealed two distinct clonal populations. A sensitivity assay conducted on Colletotrichum acutatum isolates from almond in California and strawberry, alongside C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado in Israel, indicated that only the avocado isolate is sensitive to benomyl.
The approaches used to identify and characterize the anthracnose pathogens in Israel included: (i) traditional methods based on various morphological criteria and benomyl sensitivity; (ii) cross-inoculation of different isolates on various fruits to determine host specificity; (iii) vegetative compatibility group (VCG) testing to assess the relatedness of isolates within and between species; and (iv) molecular analyses to identify Colletotrichum species and characterize subpopulations within species.
Characterization of Colletotrichum species has relied on several criteria, including morphology, optimal growth temperature, vegetative compatibility, benomyl sensitivity, and molecular methods. In this section, we elaborate on the approaches used to differentiate between isolates of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose on almond, avocado, and strawberry crops in Israel.
Generally, conidia of C. acutatum are elliptic-fusiform in shape, whereas conidia of C. gloeosporioides are oblong with obtuse ends. However, this criterion, as well as the size of conidia, is not consistent enough for discerning species. Numerous reports suggest that isolates of C. acutatum grew at a significantly slower rate than isolates of C. gloeosporioides (5, 50, 52). However, the growth rate of C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond in Israel was slow and did not differ significantly from that of C. acutatum from strawberry. In fact, growth rate and optimal temperature have been useful for differentiating between subpopulations of C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond crops.
Colony shape and color of cultures may vary considerably within and between species. For instance, most isolates of C. acutatum (including the almond pathogen from California) show red-salmon pigmentation in reverse culture, whereas the coloration of C. gloeosporioides cultures varies from white to dark gray. Several morphological types have been observed within a population of C. gloeosporioides from avocado grown in culture (T. Katan, unpublished): (i) conidial type, with masses of conidia and no aerial mycelium; (ii) flat mycelial type, with very little aerial mycelium or conidia; (iii) mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium; (iv) conidial-mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium and masses of conidia; (v) protoperithecial type, similar to type iv but also producing dark protoperithecia-like hyphal aggregates; and (vi) perithecial type, with simple or complex perithecia.
The existence of the teleomorph Glomerella may sometimes help in differentiating between species; however, the sexual stage has only been observed in some isolates of C. gloeosporioides from avocado (T. Katan and S. Freeman, unpublished), but not from almond. In contrast to the morphological heterogeneity observed among C. gloeosporioides isolates from avocado, the population originating from almond in Israel had uniformly growing white-to-gray colonies. It can be concluded that colony color and shape of conidia are unsatisfactory methods for species identification, primarily due to the diversity of these characteristics in C. gloeosporioides, which is indicative of its heterogeneity.
Cross-infection potential has been reported among different species of Colletotrichum and genotypes of C. gloeosporioides affecting various tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits under artificial inoculation conditions. For example, isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from a variety of temperate fruits caused disease symptoms that were visually indistinguishable when inoculated on detached peach fruits. Additionally, C. gloeosporioides isolates from seven tropical fruit crops were shown to cross-infect alternate detached leaves and fruits, with the success of infection appearing to depend on inoculum density.
In studies conducted in Israel, researchers aimed to determine whether avocado anthracnose was caused by the same subspecies of C. gloeosporioides responsible for almond anthracnose, particularly since almond groves are located alongside avocado plantations in certain cultivation areas. Similarly, other crops, such as anemone, apple, mango, and strawberry, are known to be susceptible to Colletotrichum in Israel. To evaluate the potential for cross-infection, isolates from different crops were cross-inoculated on various hosts.
Our study demonstrated that C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango, as well as C. acutatum isolates from almond, anemone, apple, and peach, were able to infect detached fruits of other hosts, including two varieties of apple, avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine. These results indicated cross-infection potential between two species: C. gloeosporioides (including representatives of distinct subpopulations from almond, apple, avocado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach), across a variety of fruit species. However, these experiments were conducted under extreme conditions typical of artificial inoculations, whereas isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence of cross-infection occurring under field conditions.
Vegetative compatibility group (VCG) studies offer another approach to assessing genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more genetically similar, constituting a distinct genetic population.
VCG studies were conducted with isolates of Colletotrichum from almond (from Israel and the United States), avocado (Israel), and strawberry (Israel) crops to determine genetic relatedness within and between populations. The Israeli isolates of C. gloeosporioides and Californian isolates of C. acutatum from almond belonged to single, distinct VCGs and formed complementary heterokaryons only between mutants from different isolates within each population. Notably, almond isolates from Israel were not compatible with local isolates of Colletotrichum from avocado, indicating that the almond population constitutes a distinct subspecific group within C. gloeosporioides.
Traditional methods have not been satisfactory for differentiating between species and subspecies of Colletotrichum, leading to an increased popularity of molecular approaches over the last decade. Molecular methods have been successfully employed to differentiate between populations of Colletotrichum from various hosts, particularly from almond, avocado, and strawberry.
rDNA genes exist as multiple copies in the genome. Due to the lesser conservation of sequence, the non-transcribed and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA subunits are suitable for detecting recent evolutionary divergence within Colletotrichum. In our study, limited restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified rDNA were utilized to differentiate representative isolates of C. gloeosporioides from a diverse range of hosts, as well as from rDNA of C. acutatum sourced from strawberry. Species-specific primers have been designed based on the dissimilarities in the sequences of the ITS regions from various Colletotrichum species. We employed such primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. As shown in Figure 5A, a single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range but was absent in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae amplified a specific 450-bp fragment, allowing these two species to be distinguished from C. acutatum. This method also facilitated the differentiation between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus. These findings indicate that rDNA analysis serves as an effective taxonomic tool for species identification and diagnostic pathogen detection in plants, although it may not reveal subpopulations within a species.
Repetitive DNA elements have proven useful for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) grouping of various Colletotrichum species. For instance, a repetitive nuclear DNA element (GcpR1), originally identified in the bean anthracnose pathogen C. lindemuthianum, was successfully used to differentiate among 10 species of Colletotrichum, producing unique polymorphic patterns for each species. When GcpR1 was employed to compare C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado in Israel, the band patterns of the almond isolates were uniform and distinct from those of the avocado isolates. Additionally, polymorphic fragments were observed within the avocado isolates, correlating with the morphological and VCG heterogeneity of this population.
A+T-rich DNA, associated with the mitochondrial genome, can be detected using the restriction enzyme HaeIII, which recognizes and cleaves the DNA sequence GGCC. This A+T-rich DNA is cleaved infrequently by HaeIII, whereas most of the nuclear DNA is digested into fragments of less than 2 kb.
HaeIII RFLPs of A+T-rich DNA were successfully used to characterize Colletotrichum isolates from 10 species, with each representative revealing unique restriction patterns. The results of this approach were similar to those obtained using the GcpR1 repetitive element, where C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond exhibited unique band patterns, in contrast to the polymorphic fragments observed for avocado isolates. This method also facilitated the grouping of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach, as well as differentiation among C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango.
Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), or ap-PCR, has been extensively utilized for the identification and characterization of isolates in Colletotrichum. We employed ap-PCR using primers derived from minisatellite or repeat sequences (CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG, TGTCTGTCTGTCTGTC, GACACGACACGACAC, GACAGACAGACAGACA) to compare Colletotrichum species from almond, avocado, strawberry, and other fruits. Unique band patterns were observed among the clonal populations of C. acutatum from strawberry and C. gloeosporioides from almond, while avocado isolates exhibited polymorphisms.
Ap-PCR was effective in accurately differentiating between C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae from strawberry: C. acutatum and C. fragariae populations shared a common band pattern, while C. gloeosporioides patterns were polymorphic. This method proved useful for taxonomic identification of strawberry isolates from South Carolina as C. acutatum based on unique amplification products, determining the uniformity of Israeli C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, and demonstrating heterogeneity within C. gloeosporioides as illustrated by multiple band patterns.
Varying band patterns indicate that C. acutatum isolates from diverse hostsâincluding anemone, almond, apple, peach, pecan, and strawberryârepresent three genotypes, showcasing considerable overall heterogeneity within this species.
In summary, rDNA analysis is a reliable method for taxonomic species identification, while the use of GcpR1 and other repetitive DNA elements, A+T-rich DNA RFLPs, and ap-PCR are valuable methods for assessing subpopulation diversity within species.
Although C. gloeosporioides infects hundreds of different plant species, individual strains may have restricted host ranges, as demonstrated by a clonal subpopulation of C. gloeosporioides from almond grown in Israel. It is often presumed that host-specific populations reproduce only asexually; however, certain isolates of C. gloeosporioides with different host specificities have been observed to mate under laboratory conditions. Highly variable populations are generally more adaptable to changing conditions than those with limited variation, and sexual reproduction and recombination play a significant role in the genetic variability observed in fungal populations.
C. gloeosporioides is a highly variable species, as evidenced by its morphological traits and molecular markers. Furthermore, some strains of C. gloeosporioides/G. cingulata from avocado produce the sexual stage in culture, suggesting that they may also reproduce sexually.

Summary: Colletotrichum is a broad-range pathogen, demonstrating cases of multiple species on a single host (see Table 1) and single species on diverse hosts (see Table 2). This article emphasizes that certain populations of Colletotrichum appear to be host-specific, exemplified by C. gloeosporioides from almond in Israel. However, in other geographic regions, the same host may be affected by additional species, as recently demonstrated with C. acutatum causing almond anthracnose in California. The presence of intermediate forms has introduced ambiguity into species identification. The validity of these mycotaxons as âmycological (formerly botanical) speciesâ is significant from a phytopathological perspective but lies beyond the scope of this article.
Future Outlook: Many anthracnose-susceptible hosts are cultivated worldwide, with damage to yield being particularly significant in the tropics.
The fact that Colletotrichum species differ in their sensitivity to certain fungicides, such as benomyl, is critical for chemical pathogen control. This variability should be taken into account when implementing a spray program, especially in mixed populations like C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, which affect several hosts, including apple, citrus, mango, peach, pecan, and strawberries. Differential sensitivity among these species may result in shifts in population ratios.
From a phytopathological perspective, the considerable pathogenic variation evident within these species, often coupled with additional phenotypic variation, may warrant further investigation into subspecific groups that reflect host specificity. Ideally, species names should refer to broad groupings, as strains from the subspecies level indicate host specialization.
The taxonomy of Colletotrichum species is currently in a state of constant flux and remains confusing. The general acceptance of subgrouping may require additional support based on biological criteria independent of pathogenicity. Traditional methods of classification, such as morphology, colony color, and conidia size, may not provide accurate identification of species and subspecies, which is crucial for effective disease management, resistance breeding, and pathogen control. Molecular and vegetative compatibility group (VCG) analyses are likely candidates for providing the necessary information.
Molecular approaches have been successfully utilized for the taxonomic identification and determination of genetic diversity in Colletotrichum populations. Recent studies have employed species-specific primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from various hosts. To enhance the effectiveness of this approach for in vivo pathogen diagnosis, it is essential to develop simple and rapid DNA extraction techniques, enabling multiple sampling and testing.
When Colletotrichum is classified as a quarantine pathogen, DNA can be safely transferred between countries for diagnostic purposes, thus preventing pathogen dissemination. Population diversity is hypothesized to primarily arise from sexual reproduction. Understanding and observing the sexual stage is vital for determining whether a population is homogeneous or heterogeneous and for developing a sexual genetic system.
The subdivision of isolates by vegetative compatibility groups (VCG) is well recognized. However, the applicability of various techniques for overall delineation of subspecific subgenotypes and phenotypic traits has proven to be dependable, as evidenced by correlations with the risk of undesired pathogen dissemination from one geographic location to another. Additional work should concentrate on determining populations by VCG, which has yet to be fully established.
In particular, the ability to accurately identify phenotypically similar strains from diverse sources and separate them from other phenotypes using molecular markers must be demonstrated. The capacity for controlled self/nonself discrimination between fungal strains yields clear-cut results in most cases. It is applicable primarily to anamorphic, clonally related populations. While PCR-amplified bands from random primers unrelated to functional genes lack biological meaning, Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis can still maintain its significance in studying population genetics at the subspecies level.
In sexually reproducing populations, relationships can be determined by sexual compatibility, which serves as the ultimate criterion for delineating mating populations within a species. Unlike DNA-based methods, tests based on VCG and sexual crosses require living fungi. Consequently, strains that are compared may need to be moved from one location to another. Within species, multiple genotypes of Colletotrichum acutatum exist, with isolates appearing on various hosts. Although clonal populations have been observed (e.g., on strawberries in Israel), it remains uncertain whether the presence of the sexual stage significantly contributes to genetic diversity within C. acutatum, similar to the hypotheses for C. gloeosporioides.
