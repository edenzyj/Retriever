Leandro, L. F. S., Gleason, M. L., Nutter, F. W., Jr., Wegulo, S. N., and Dixon, P. M. 2001. Germination and sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves. Phytopathology 91:659-664.
The germination and sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum were characterized over time on strawberry leaves (cv. Tristar) and plastic coverslips incubated at 26°C under continuous wetness. Conidia germinated within 3 hours after inoculation and formed melanized appressoria with pores by 9 hours after inoculation. Host penetration was not observed up to 7 days after inoculation. Production of secondary conidia on conidial surfaces began within 6 hours after inoculation. Secondary conidiation was responsible for up to a threefold increase in the total number of conidia within 7 days after inoculation. Primary conidia and hyphae began to collapse 48 hours after inoculation, whereas melanized appressoria remained intact. These findings suggest that appressoria and secondary conidia of C. acutatum produced on symptomless strawberry foliage may be significant sources of inoculum for fruit infections.
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, is responsible for major losses in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) production worldwide. Fruit rot and flower blight are common symptoms in fruiting fields, while lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are particularly damaging in plant nurseries. C. acutatum may also cause crown rot and plant death in some regions. The pathogen is apparently introduced into production fields on infected or infested propagation material. During warm, moist periods, lesions formed on transplants produce abundant conidia that are splash dispersed onto flowers and fruits, resulting in new infections. However, when epidemics develop in fields where symptomless propagation material was planted, the source of initial inoculum is not clearly identifiable. Eastburn and Gubler suggested that the fungus is transported in infested soil attached to strawberry crowns, but the form and fate of fungal propagules from this potential inoculum source were not reported. Several studies have suggested that C. acutatum can develop quiescent infections on strawberry plants, but the epidemiological role of such infections prior to colonization of fruits and senescing foliage has not been investigated.
The histology of infection by Colletotrichum spp. has been studied thoroughly on several hosts. Conidia germinate either by producing germ tubes and terminal appressoria or by forming sessile appressoria. Appressoria become melanized and develop pores from which host penetration occurs. Two types of infections can develop: (i) intracellular hemibiotrophic, in which infection vesicles or swollen hyphae form within epidermal cells (e.g., on Pinus needles), and (ii) subcuticular, intramural necrotrophic, where cuticular penetration is followed by hyphal proliferation within the cuticle and epidermal cell walls.

Symptomless foliage harbors inoculum for fruit and flower infections by several Colletotrichum species (7, 21, 28). Pantidou and Schroeder (21) demonstrated that conidia of C. phomoides harvested from symptomless tomato leaves could cause infections on tomato fruit. In citrus, C. acutatum survives on leaves as quiescent appressoria (28, 30), which can be stimulated to germinate and produce secondary conidia, serving as inoculum for flower infections. It has also been suggested that quiescent infections on strawberry leaves may provide inoculum for strawberry anthracnose epidemics (23). However, the potential for inoculum production on symptomless strawberry leaves has not been investigated. A better understanding of the ecology of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage before the onset of fruit rot symptoms may yield insights to improve management strategies for strawberry anthracnose.
The objective of this study was to characterize and quantify the germination and sporulation of C. acutatum on symptomless strawberry foliage during periods of leaf wetness. A preliminary report has already been published (12).
Plant Production and Maintenance: Day-neutral strawberry crowns (cv. Tristar) were planted in 15-cm-diameter plastic pots containing a 1:2:1 mixture of peat, perlite, and soil. The plants were grown in a greenhouse maintained at 25 ± 4°C with a 16-hour photoperiod. They were drip irrigated and fertilized weekly with a 21-5-20 fertilizer solution (400 ppm N; Miracle Gro Excel, Marysville, OH). For each experiment, newly unfurled leaves were tagged 7 to 10 days before sampling to ensure uniformity in leaf age.
Inoculum Production: Isolate HF-ac-98 of C. acutatum was obtained from an infected strawberry fruit collected at the Iowa State University Horticulture Research Farm near Gilbert. The isolate was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) amended with 150 ppm of streptomycin and 150 ppm of tetracycline, then transferred to silica gel for long-term storage. All cultures used for inoculum preparation were initiated by depositing infested silica gel crystals onto PDA plates and culturing them at 26°C in darkness until conidia developed. Conidia collected from PDA cultures were seeded onto strawberry fruit agar (SFA), prepared with 200 ml of blended, pesticide-free ripe strawberries (cv. Tristar), 20 g of agar, 3 g of CaCO3, and 800 ml of distilled water (pH 5.5 to 6.0).
Conidial suspensions for inoculations were prepared from 7-day-old cultures grown on SFA at 26°C in darkness. Each SFA culture plate was flooded with 9 ml of sterile deionized water (SDW) and scraped with a rubber policeman to dislodge conidia. The resulting suspension was filtered through two layers of cheesecloth into a flask. The conidia were washed by centrifuging twice at 3,020 × g for 2 minutes, discarding the supernatant, and resuspending the conidial pellet in SDW each time. The final conidial suspension was adjusted to 5 × 10^5 conidia per ml for leaf inoculations and 5 × 10^3 conidia per ml for coverslip inoculations to ensure a similar conidial density on both surfaces.
Leaf Inoculation: Leaves were excised at the petiole base and placed in humid chambers, which were plastic boxes (24 × 34 × 6 cm) containing 500 ml of SDW. The leaves were suspended above the water on wire mesh, with the excised ends of the petioles inserted through the mesh into the water. Within an hour after sampling, the wire mesh containing the leaves was removed from each chamber, and the leaves were spray-treated...
Four leaves were sampled arbitrarily at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12, 15, 18, 21, 24, 36, 48, 72, 96, 120, 144, and 168 hours after inoculation. Two leaf disks were excised from each leaf, one on either side of the central vein of the middle leaflet, using a 1-cm-diameter cork borer. The disks were fixed in 2% glutaraldehyde for 3 hours and cleared in saturated chloral hydrate (200 g per 20 ml of deionized water) for 5 days. After mounting the disks on a drop of Hoyer’s medium and staining with 0.1% aniline blue in lactophenol, they were observed under a differential interference contrast microscope for conidial germination.
The total number of germinated and ungerminated conidia was counted in each of 16 microscope fields (×500) observed on each leaf disk. These fields were selected by visually dividing a leaf disk into four quadrants and arbitrarily selecting four fields in each quadrant. A conidium was considered germinated when it had formed either a germ tube at least as long as its width, an appressorium, or a conidial phialide. Appressoria that were unmelanized, melanized without an appressorial pore, or melanized with an appressorial pore were also counted. An appressorium was defined as a globose, septum-delimited structure that formed either on a hyphal tip or was sessile to a conidium. Dark brown appressoria were considered melanized, and appressorial pores were identified as small, basal, hyaline openings at the center of an appressorium. Data were converted to an area basis (square millimeters) by dividing the total number of conidia or appressoria in each leaf disk by the area of the 16 microscope fields observed per disk. Eight disks were counted at each sampling time, and the experiment was repeated once.
Leaves inoculated as described previously were incubated for 24 hours and prepared for scanning electron microscopy (SEM). Leaf disks were fixed overnight at 4°C in cacodylate buffer (pH 7.4) containing 2% glutaraldehyde and 2% paraformaldehyde, rinsed in buffer, and processed through graded alcohols to 100%. The disks were critical point dried in a Denton Critical Point Drying Apparatus (DCP-1, Denton Vacuum, Inc., Moorestown, NJ), mounted on aluminum stubs, and coated with a gold-palladium alloy to a thickness of approximately 300 angstroms using a Desk II Cold Sputter/Etch Unit (Denton Vacuum). Microscopic observations were conducted with a JEOL (Japanese Electron Optic Laboratories, Tokyo) SEM (JSM-5800LV) at 10 kV.
For coverslip inoculation, conidial germination was also studied on plastic coverslips (22 × 22 mm). A 0.1-ml droplet of conidial suspension (5 × 10^3 conidia per ml) was deposited in the center of each of four coverslips placed on moistened filter paper in glass petri dishes. Each petri dish was sealed with Parafilm to maintain 100% relative humidity and incubated at 26°C in darkness. Coverslips were sampled at intervals similar to those for inoculated leaves and prepared for microscopic observation by mounting on slides and staining with a drop of 0.1% aniline blue in lactophenol. Conidial germination and appressorium development were quantified at ×250 magnification as described for leaf disks. Four coverslips were counted for each sampling time, and the experiment was repeated once.
C. acutatum (19), while the remaining five leaves were not frozen. The two lateral leaflets from each leaf were detached and placed, adaxial side up, onto PDA amended with streptomycin (150 ppm), tetracycline (150 ppm), and Tergitol (18 drops per liter). The plates were sealed with Parafilm and incubated for 5 days at 26°C in darkness. The number of inoculum droplets that yielded C. acutatum colonies on each leaflet was counted 5 days after inoculation. A total of 40 droplets were assessed per treatment (four droplets per five leaves, two leaflets per leaf).
In the second assessment of host penetration, four leaves were inoculated with two 0.02-ml drops of a 10^5 conidia per ml suspension of unwashed conidia and incubated in crispers for 72 hours, as described previously. Leaf segments containing an inoculum droplet were excised from each leaf, and 50 µm thick transverse sections were prepared using a vibrating microtome. Leaf sections were stained with 0.1% aniline blue in lactophenol and observed under oil immersion at ×1,000. Each leaf section was evaluated for the presence of subepidermal infection structures beneath appressoria. A total of 40 leaf sections (five sections from two droplets across four leaves), each containing five or more appressoria, were observed, and the experiment was repeated once.
Data analysis: Since most population growth trends reached an apparent asymptote at 48 hours, counts of total conidia, total appressoria, and total appressoria with pores were averaged over the period of 48 to 168 hours to represent the final population size, and the corresponding standard errors of the mean were calculated. The initial population size (primary conidia) was determined by the total number of conidia 3 hours after inoculation.
Germination process: Conidia began to germinate on leaves and coverslips within 3 hours after inoculation (Fig. 1). Most conidia developed a central transverse septum and germinated at one or both ends by forming a germination tube or a sessile appressorium. Some conidia, however, did not become septate. Appressoria also developed at the distal ends of the elongated germination tubes, which were sometimes branched.
Secondary conidiation of Colletotrichum acutatum on strawberry leaves 24 hours after inoculation was observed by scanning electron microscopy. In the images, a primary conidium with a secondary conidium attached to the conidial phialide is shown, highlighting the mucilage surrounding the primary conidium and appressorium. The primary conidium was seen with a secondary conidium detaching from the hypha, with detached secondary conidia potentially produced by a partially visible conidial phialide. Initially, appressoria were hyaline but then became melanized, developing basal pores on both leaves and coverslips. Many sessile appressoria did not become melanized but instead formed a germination tube at the tip where another melanized appressorium developed. By 48 hours after inoculation, the primary conidia used for inoculating plants began to collapse and disintegrate, while several hyphal segments and conidial cells became melanized.
Secondary conidia were produced by primary conidia that germinated with phialides instead of germination tubes and by phialides forming on elongated germination tubes. Conidial phialides were observed on nonseptate primary conidia and on septate primary conidia that had developed a germination tube or appressorium at the opposite end. Secondary conidia were first observed on conidial phialides 9 and 6 hours after inoculation in experiments 1 and 2, respectively, and on hyphal phialides 24 hours after inoculation. Both conidial and hyphal phialides produced multiple secondary conidia that detached and accumulated near the phialides.
In the coverslip experiments, conidia germinated and formed structures similar to those observed on leaves (Fig. 1C and D). However, the fungal behavior was more variable between sampling times and across the two experiments. Germination began within 3 hours after inoculation in experiment 1, but occurred between 9 and 12 hours after inoculation in experiment 2.
Appressorium Development: In both leaf experiments, the number of initially unmelanized appressoria on leaf surfaces decreased starting 6 hours after inoculation as melanization occurred (Fig. 3A and B). Appressorial pores were first observed approximately at the same time that melanization began. The number of appressoria with pores increased over time, with most having pores after 18 and 36 hours in experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Between 48 and 168 hours after inoculation, an average of 60% of the total appressoria on leaves developed appressorial pores (Table 1). On coverslips, appressoria became melanized and formed pores, but a higher number of appressoria remained unmelanized relative to the total number of appressoria compared to leaves (Fig. 3C and D).
Host Penetration: The presence of intra- or intercellular infection structures on cleared leaf disks was not detected. In the surface disinfestation experiments, unfrozen leaves remained green throughout the experiment, except for some localized browning on leaves from the surface-disinfested or peeled/disinfested treatments, possibly as a response to wounding. All frozen leaves were uniformly brown, resulting from senescence induced by freezing. On unfrozen leaves, 0, 4, and 4 out of 40 inoculum droplets yielded C. acutatum colonies in the untreated, surface-disinfested, and peeled/disinfested treatments, respectively. Colonies of C. acutatum, consisting of bright orange acervular masses, developed only where tissue browning coincided with inoculated sites, but never on green leaf areas. On frozen leaves, 40, 13, and 0 out of 40 inoculum droplets yielded C. acutatum colonies in the untreated, surface-disinfested, and peeled/disinfested treatments, respectively. Host penetration was not detected in microscopic observations of more than 300 appressoria on transverse leaf sections.
This is the first report of secondary conidia production by C. acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves. Secondary conidiation, also known as microcyclic or precocious conidiation, is defined as conidiation that occurs directly after conidial germination with little or no mycelial growth. This phenomenon has been reported for several fungi, including other Colletotrichum species, but its occurrence in C. acutatum was previously described only in vitro and on other hosts.
The table summarizes the results of two experiments focused on the production of secondary conidia and the formation of appressoria and appressorial pores. In Experiment 1, the average number of primary conidia was 22 ± 5.8, resulting in 75 ± 18.1 appressoria, with a ratio of 3.4 ± 1.2 appressoria per primary conidium. Among these, 59 ± 16.0 formed appressoria with pores, and the proportion of appressoria with pores was 0.8 ± 0.3. The corresponding data for Experiment 2 showed a higher average of primary conidia at 52 ± 13.0, resulting in 69 ± 16.7 appressoria, yielding a ratio of 1.3 ± 0.5 appressoria per primary conidium and 78 ± 17.5 appressoria with pores, with a proportion of 1.1 ± 0.4.
For the subsequent trials (noted as 1 and 2), the primary conidia counts were 11 ± 1.6 and 6 ± 1.5, with corresponding appressoria counts of 23 ± 6.6 and 11 ± 2.8. The ratios and proportions of appressoria and those with pores followed a similar trend to the earlier experiments.
The footnotes clarify that the primary conidia are the means from a total count at 3 hours post-inoculation, while appressoria and their counts were averaged over a longer period (48 to 168 hours). Standard errors of the mean are provided for all measurements.
Previous research indicates that foliage can serve as a significant inoculum source for fruit and flower infections caused by various Colletotrichum species on several hosts. Notably, Zulfiqar et al. demonstrated that C. acutatum appressoria can germinate and produce secondary conidia on leaf surfaces in response to water and flower extracts, leading to splash dispersal and subsequent fruit drop.
In the current study, we observed a collapse of fungal hyphae and primary conidia within 48 hours after inoculation, leaving only melanized appressoria, hyphal segments, and secondary conidia intact on both leaf and coverslip surfaces. These melanized structures likely represent the pathogen's survival mechanisms on symptomless leaves. It is plausible that, similar to the behavior observed in citrus, appressoria can be stimulated to germinate and generate secondary conidia, which may act as primary inoculum for strawberry fruit infections.
While C. acutatum formed melanized appressoria with pores, consistent with previous observations on strawberries and other hosts, we found no evidence of host penetration or quiescent infections using the three employed methods. The presence of appressorial pores on both surfaces does not necessarily indicate host penetration. Previous work using nail polish to strip leaf surfaces has successfully identified quiescent infections in citrus, but our experiments did not yield any C. acutatum colonies on the leaves studied.
Our evidence suggests that Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum can survive and multiply on symptomless strawberry leaves, and that the production of secondary conidia may increase inoculum when susceptible tissue is not available. Greater awareness of the surreptitious fungal dynamics on symptomless plants may also justify changes in currently recommended control strategies. For instance, early fungicide applications might effectively reduce initial inoculum production on developing plants, thereby decreasing subsequent epidemic development on fruit.
Figure 3 illustrates the appressorial development of Colletotrichum acutatum on strawberry leaves across two experiments. In experiment 1 (A) and experiment 2 (B), leaves were spray inoculated with a suspension containing 5 × 10^5 conidia per ml. Additionally, coverslips were inoculated with 0.1-ml droplets of a 5 × 10^3 conidia per ml suspension for experiments 1 (C) and 2 (D). Both samples were incubated at 26°C in darkness. The error bars shown in the figure represent ±1 standard error of the mean, calculated from pooled variance among observations (N = 8) at each time point and averaged across all curves.
