It's important to distinguish between species within the same species complex since different species may require different infection management strategies (Cai et al. 2011). For example, while Colletotrichum kahawae is an aggressive pathogen of coffee, Colletotrichum asianum, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Colletotrichum siamense are opportunistic pathogens.
Abstract: Colletotrichum fungi belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex include several economically significant postharvest pathogens that often cause anthracnose. Previously, different species in this group could only be reliably distinguished using multigenic phylogenetic analyses. Using a comparative genomics approach, we developed a marker to differentiate Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum aenigma, and Colletotrichum siamense within the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on PCR amplicon size differences. When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing different species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberries in Japan and contributes to our understanding of the diversity of anthracnose pathogens in the country.

The nucleotide sequence data reported are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession numbers KU642469–KU642552, KX247845–KX247850, and KX513878–KX513929.
Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.
Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum can be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories (Cai et al. 2011). Several of these lineages have now been systematically classified as species complexes comprising closely related sibling species (Weir et al. 2012). Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). Additionally, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex. However, different species do not require the same level of control when encountered in the field (Prihastuti et al. 2009).
In this study, we use the term isolate to refer to a pure culture derived from a single sample of an infected plant, while strain denotes a defined isolate that can be distinguished from others through phylogenetic methods, specifically based on six combined loci: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, TUB, and GAPDH. Isolates from the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex were collected from anthracnose lesions on strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) or randomly sampled from latently infected strawberry plants in the Inba, Chiba, Kimitsu, Awa, Chosei, Sanbu, and Kaiso regions of Chiba Prefecture between 1994 and 2014. For latently infected plants, conidia were isolated using the ethanol immersion technique (Ishikawa 2003). These isolates were identified as members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex using the CgInt primer and the universal primer ITS4 (Mills et al. 1992).
Pairwise alignments of genome assemblies were conducted using the nucmer program with default settings (Kurtz et al. 2004). Conserved regions within the genomes of C. fructicola (Cg38), C. aenigma (Cg56; MAFF 305913), and C. siamense (Cg363; P. Gan et al., unpublished data) were identified using the bedtools suite (Quinlan and Hall 2010). The sequences encompassing the marker regions have been deposited in GenBank (accessions KX247845–KX247850). Nucleotide BLAST searches were performed using the nucleotide sequences between the predicted primer binding sites as queries against specific individual genome assemblies in CLC Genomics Workbench 8 (QIAGEN) (E-value cutoff = 1E-5).
Sequences from actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), β-tubulin 2 (TUB), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) were amplified from isolates using primers listed in Table 1. Fungal DNA was extracted using the DNeasy kit (QIAGEN). PCR reactions were set up with 2× PCR mix (Promega), 0.5 µM each of forward and reverse primers (Table 1), and 25–75 ng of purified fungal DNA per tube. The DNA sequences obtained have been deposited in GenBank (accessions KU642469–KU642552 and KX513878–KX513929). PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, 55 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 1 minute, with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. The resulting DNA sequences were aligned with sequences of previously classified isolates (Weir et al. 2012) using the MAFFT program (version 7.215; Katoh et al. 2002) and trimmed using the trimAl program (version 1.2rev59; Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009) with the automated1 settings. The concatenated alignment comprised 2854 positions, which were partitioned according to genes and used for phylogenetic tree analysis employing maximum likelihood in RAxML (version 8.2.4; Stamatakis 2014) and Bayesian inference using MrBayes (version 3.2.6; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). The program PartitionFinder (version 1.1.1; Lanfear et al. 2012) identified the best nucleotide substitution models for each partition based on the Bayesian Information Criterion (BIC). Both RAxML and MrBayes analyses utilized the GTRGAMMA + I model for each partition, allowing distinct evolutionary rates per partition. MrBayes was run for 20,000,000 generations, with samples taken every 1000 generations, discarding the first 25% as burn-in. Trees were visualized using FigTree (version 1.4.2). Sequences from Colletotrichum boninense (Weir et al. 2012) were included as an outgroup.

Strains (Suzuki et al. 2008) were used to distinguish between virulent and less virulent isolates.
The genomes of three strains isolated from infected strawberry plants—Cg38 (isolated from Chiba), Cg56 (isolated from Tochigi), and Cg363 (isolated from Chiba)—which belonged to different groups based on a previous rep-PCR analysis (Suzuki et al. 2012), were sequenced. These strains were then classified using multigenic phylogenetic analysis of the ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, GAPDH, and TUB sequences (Fig. 1). In the multigenic phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1, 2), the three strains were separated into three distinct species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex: C. fructicola (Cg38), C. aenigma (Cg56), and C. siamense (Cg363).
The Cg38 strain was closely related to the previously sequenced C. fructicola Nara gc5 (Gan et al. 2013) and was used as a reference strain in subsequent analyses. Pairwise alignments of the genome assemblies were carried out using the C. fructicola (Cg38) assembly as the reference strain. A total of 5,987 genomic regions identified using the nucmer analysis (Fig. 3), comprising 6.35 Mb of sequence present in the reference strain, were not conserved in the C. siamense and C. aenigma assemblies. Among the 5,897 genomic regions, 2,203 were specific to the reference C. fructicola strain. Of the other 3,784 regions, 3,110 unconserved regions were flanked by at least 2 kb of sequence in the reference strain. Of these, 1,025 target regions were between 200 bp and 1 kb in size. To design primers, it was necessary to identify target regions flanked by highly conserved regions. Therefore, sequences including these 1,025 target regions were queried for overlap with 6,153 genomic regions that were conserved among the three strains mentioned. A total of 1,365 potential conserved regions were found to flank the target regions (Fig. 3).
Among these, two loci were manually selected for further analysis. Approximately 1.5–4 kb of the selected loci from the reference strain were then used as queries for a BLAST search of the available genome assemblies. Primers were designed based on sequences that were conserved in all isolates and present in single-copy regions. Primers were tested on several isolates that were classified based on phylogenetic trees constructed from ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, TUB, and GAPDH sequences, including sequences from members of the previously classified C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012).
In the C. fructicola genome, the region targeted by Marker 1 was found to overlap with the CGGC5_05943 gene, which encodes a hypothetical protein. The protein encoded by CGGC5_05943 is conserved in the genomes of strains outside the C. gloeosporioides species complex, such as C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, C. orbiculare, C. sublineola, and C. oriniae. However, there is sufficient divergence at the nucleotide level such that nucleotide BLAST...
Figure 1 illustrates a Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree depicting the relationships among selected strains from the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. The nodes of the tree display Bayesian posterior probability values, indicating the confidence in the relationships between these strains. The scale bar represents the number of expected changes per site based on sequences of GAPDH and ITS.
Marker 2 amplicon sizes range from 300 bp to 1000 bp across various strains.
The text includes various C. aotearoa strains with associated ICMP codes and their respective amplicon sizes, indicating the genetic diversity and relationships among these fungal strains. Additionally, there are several entries for C. kahawae subspecies, along with other fungal species.
The text references a collection of Colletotrichum isolates, each identified by specific codes, along with their associated identification numbers. For instance, several entries list isolates of C. alatae, such as ICMP18122 and CBS304.67, while C. gloeosporioides is represented by IMI356878. Other species include C. asianum (e.g., ICMP18580) and C. queenslandicum (ICMP18705, ICMP1778), among others. The entries include varying percentages, likely indicating some measure of similarity or identification certainty, although this is not explicitly defined.
The context also highlights some regions of interest in the study, noting unconserved regions in C. aenigma and C. siamense. A significant number of regions (3784) were flanked by reference sequences, with a smaller subset (3110) noted for specific sizes. The results of amplified regions using Marker 1 indicated specificity to C. fructicola, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, with BLAST analysis confirming the absence of certain sequences in closely related strains.
In PCR experiments, Marker 2 showed amplification results with varying band sizes across different species, suggesting a correlation between amplicon size and species classification. The isolates were categorized using multilocus phylogenetic trees based on Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods, resulting in consistent topologies across analyses.
Overall, the study investigates the genetic diversity and specificity of Colletotrichum species through molecular techniques, contributing to a better understanding of their phylogenetic relationships.
In recent years, the need to reclassify plant pathogens such as Colletotrichum using molecular-based techniques has been recognized. Previous classifications based on morphology and host range have been found to be likely incorrect or less definitive (Ko Ko et al., 2011). Studies aimed at characterizing specific species associated with infections are important since different species may lead to varied infection outcomes in the field, as noted in studies of coffee anthracnose (Prihastuti et al., 2009).
Table 2 presents the year of isolation and prefecture of origin for various strains used to test Marker 2. It includes strains isolated from strawberry plants, detailing their origins and symptoms observed. For example, strains such as Cg38 and Cg39 were isolated in 1994 and 2001, respectively, from Awa and Kaisou, but the symptoms for these strains are indicated as unknown (?). Other strains, such as Cg111 and Cg112, were isolated from Chiba in 2001 and showed no symptoms (—). The table indicates the presence (?) or absence (—) of leaf wilt or spot symptoms on the source plants for all listed strains. Overall, it provides a comprehensive overview of the geographical and symptomatic diversity among the tested Colletotrichum isolates.
To categorize strains into different groups, other studies have utilized random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphisms, internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (ITS-RFLP), and classifications based on ITS sequences (Gautam, 2014; Smith, 2008). While RAPD and ITS-RFLP polymorphisms indicate genetic variability among isolates, specific polymorphisms have not yet been linked to particular species. Moreover, classifying strains using a single marker sequence has proven insufficient for distinguishing between different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al., 2012).
Using a comparative genomics strategy, we successfully developed a single marker to differentiate among three common pathogens of strawberry: C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. aenigma. This marker flanks a short repeat that is expanded in C. fructicola compared to C. siamense and C. aenigma. It is likely that this sequence was acquired or expanded in C. fructicola because it was absent in closely related C. kahawae strains. The comparative genomics method employed in this study is considered a practical strategy that can be further used to develop markers for other distinguishing traits or species differences.
The multilocus phylogenetic analysis of 20 isolates from Japan indicated that these isolates tend to group together within each species, suggesting a single introduction of the different species into the field. This finding is perhaps not surprising given that the isolates originated from a restricted geographical area, but further phylogenetic analyses are needed to confirm this, as the current analysis was limited to only 20 isolates.
