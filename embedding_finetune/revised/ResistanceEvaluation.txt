Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.

Strawberries (Fragaria×ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).

Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.
An extensive survey was conducted in strawberry fields across the Kurdistan province of Iran, particularly in the counties known for significant strawberry production, including Sanandaj, Mariwan, Kamyaran, and Sarvabad. Typical symptoms of the disease were monitored, and samples were collected from symptomatic plant parts exhibiting leaf spots, stem necrosis, and/or fruit rot. These samples were transferred to the laboratory in individual sterile boxes.
Based on Koch’s postulates, the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum-like isolates was evaluated on detached untreated fruits of Fragaria × ananassa cv. Camarosa. In brief, the fruits were surface-disinfected by dipping them in 1% sodium hypochlorite, followed by 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, and rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. They were then left to dry on sterile paper under a laminar flow hood. Three hundred microliters (μL) of conidial suspension (1 × 10^6 conidia mL^-1) of each isolate, containing Tween 80 (0.1%; v/v), was placed on each fruit. Each treatment included five fruits, with sterile distilled water containing 0.1% Tween 80 used as the untreated control. After 7 days, disease incidence and severity were calculated based on the disease index as described by Karimi et al. (2017). To calculate disease severity, the total surface area of each strawberry fruit, approximated as having a conical shape, was measured, and the disease severity rate was calculated using the formula: t/T × 100, where (t) is the infected area and (T) is the total area of each strawberry fruit.
All strawberry cultivars used in this study were obtained from the strawberry collection of the Kurdistan Agricultural and Natural Resources Research and Education Center in Sanandaj, Iran.
Detached untreated leaves of selected commercial strawberry cultivars were initially surface-sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 seconds, followed by 70% ethanol, and then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. The leaves were allowed to dry on sterile paper under a laminar hood before inoculation. Inoculation was performed as described by Karimi et al. (2019). Based on the leaf size, four to twelve wounds were made on the adaxial surface of each leaf using a sterile sharp needle. For inoculation, a 5 mm plug of seven-day-old fungal culture of C. nymphaeae PET1 was placed on the wounds of each leaf. After inoculation, leaves were kept in plastic containers with moistened filter papers at 23°C to maintain high relative humidity (> 95%). Five detached leaves were inoculated for each fungal strain, and pathogen-free PDA plugs served as control. After 8 days, the affected area on the leaf surface was measured using ImageJ v. 1.51i software (https://imagej.nih.gov/ij/index.html) for the calculation of disease severity.
Detached untreated fruits of each cultivar were inoculated with the conidial suspension of C. nymphaeae PET1 at a concentration of 1 × 10^6 conidia mL^-1, containing Tween 80 (0.1%; v/v), as described in the pathogenicity test. Six fruits were inoculated for each cultivar. After 7 days, disease incidence and severity were calculated based on the previously mentioned index.
Table 1. Strawberry cultivars used in this study and their origins.
The table lists various strawberry cultivars along with their pedigrees and countries of origin. For example, "Aliso" is a self of Cal.52.16-12 from the USA, while "Aromas" is derived from Cal 87.112-6 × Cal 88.270-1, also from the USA. Other notable entries include "Blakemore" (USA), "Dachnitsa" (Belarus), and "Paros" (Italy). The table details a total of 20 cultivars, highlighting their diverse origins ranging from the USA to Turkey and Belarus.
Figure 1. Symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (A), sunken lesions on stolon (B), flower blight (C), and crown rot (D) observed on naturally infected strawberry plants caused by Colletotrichum nymphaeae collected from strawberry fields in Kurdistan province, Iran. Inoculation of leaves (E and H), fruits (F and I), and crowns (G and J) of strawberry cultivars with C. nymphaeae PET1 and their reactions.
Symptoms were noted as long to entire petiole necrosis; 5 indicates plants with wilted youngest leaves, and 6 indicates dead plants with necrotic crowns.
Data were analyzed using a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) with standard Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). Means were compared using critical differences, presented as mean ± Standard Error (SE). All analyses utilized SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., 2003).
During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017). In pathogenicity tests, all C. nymphaeae isolates were able to...
In this study, distinct levels of resistance to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) were revealed in trials involving detached leaves, fruit, and crown-based assays. In all assays, fruit, leaf, and crown infections were confirmed by re-isolation of the pathogen. In the detached leaf assay, the cultivars ‘Missionary’, ‘New Kurdistan’, ‘Ventana1’, ‘Ventana’, and ‘Blakemore’ exhibited significantly greater resistance to the disease compared to other cultivars (df = 24, F = 14.66, P ≤ 0.01). The exception included ‘Ten Beauty’, ‘N. Selva’, ‘Chandler’, ‘Aliso’, ‘Fresno’, ‘Mac Donance’, ‘Gaviota’, ‘Dachnitsa’, ‘Aromas’, and ‘Mrak’. The most susceptible cultivar was ‘Camarosa’, followed by ‘Selva’, ‘Paros’, ‘Diamant’, ‘Karcynberg’, ‘Kurdistan’, ‘Pajaro’, ‘Queen Eliza’, ‘Sequia’, and ‘Yallova’.
In the detached fruit assay, AFR was observed on all fruits from different cultivars. However, the severity of the disease varied significantly (df = 24, F = 16.85, P ≤ 0.01) among cultivars. ‘Blakemore’ and ‘Kurdistan’ were the most resistant cultivars to AFR, significantly outperforming others, including ‘Aliso’, ‘Mrak’, ‘Diamant’, ‘Yallova’, ‘New Kurdistan’, ‘Mac Donance’, and ‘Ten Beauty’. Conversely, ‘Gaviota’ was highly susceptible, significantly more so than all other cultivars except ‘Camarosa’.
In the greenhouse assay, the occurrence of anthracnose symptoms in strawberry plants inoculated with Colletotrichum nymphaeae PET1 was notably low after four months. Statistical comparisons showed no significant differences among strawberry cultivars in terms of disease incidence and severity. Only one replication of each treatment (cultivar) exhibited anthracnose crown rot.
The table outlines three assays: Detached Fruit Assay (DFA), Detached Leaf Assay (DLA), and Crown Infection Assay (CIA). For each cultivar, disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) percentages are provided.
Cultivars such as ‘Camarosa’ and ‘Gaviota’ showed high disease severity, while others like ‘Blakemore’ and ‘Kurdistan’ demonstrated significant resistance across the assays.
The data indicate that disease severity was consistently high for some cultivars in both detached leaf and detached fruit assays, with several showing 100% disease incidence.
Statistical analysis identified groups of cultivars with similar disease severity, denoted by shared letters, indicating no significant difference at P ≤ 0.01.
This study highlights the variability in resistance among strawberry cultivars to AFR and provides insights into cultivar selection for disease management.
A correlation was detected between various assays regarding disease severity (correlation coefficient = 0.1445; determination coefficient R² = 0.0209). Overall, different and non-identical reactions of cultivars to the disease were observed in detached leaf, fruit, and crown-based assays. For instance, ‘Blackmore’ was identified as a resistant cultivar in the detached fruit assay, while it was found to be susceptible in the detached leaf assay. Conversely, the indigenous cultivars ‘Kurdistan’ and ‘New Kurdistan’ were categorized as relatively resistant in both assays. Most cultivars showed no crown infection in the greenhouse trial.
These findings align with previous studies indicating that susceptibility to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) varies among different organs of a cultivar, including fruit, leaf, and root. Notably, no relationship was established between the susceptibility of various cultivars and the different organs of a single cultivar (Delp and Milholland, 1980; Smith and Spires, 1982; Smith and Black, 1990; Chandler et al., 1997). Furthermore, the presence of the pathogen might not cause symptoms on foliage, leading to latent infections. Consistent with Shuman (2001), our results suggest that the detached fruit assay is a better indicator of AFR disease susceptibility, though other methods could also enhance the understanding of disease epidemiology.
In this study, most commercial cultivars, including ‘Paros’, ‘Queen Eliza’, ‘N. Selva’, and ‘Camarosa’, commonly grown in strawberry fields in Iran, were categorized as susceptible. Therefore, deploying relatively resistant cultivars such as ‘Blackmore’, ‘Aliso’, ‘Mark’, ‘Diamant’, and ‘Yallova’ could be effective in preventing disease development in regions where the disease is endemic. Additionally, cultivars with relative resistance may be crossed with commercial cultivars in breeding programs to improve and develop resistant varieties. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to evaluate the reaction of certain commercial strawberry cultivars against Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes strawberry AFR.
