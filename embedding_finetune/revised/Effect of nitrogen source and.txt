Smith, B. J. 2009. Nitrogen fertilizer affects the severity of anthracnose crown rot disease of greenhouse-grown strawberries. Online. Plant Health Progress. doi:10.1094/PHP-2009-0609-01-RS.
The influence of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on the severity of anthracnose crown rot was evaluated in three greenhouse studies. Strawberry plants were fertilized three times weekly with a modified Hoagland's Nutrient Solution containing the treatments. Eight weeks after treatment applications began, the plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of the causal pathogen, Colletotrichum fragariae. Disease severity was rated 30 days later on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (plant dead).
In the first study, the effects of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels were evaluated using 16 treatments: eight N levels with either low or high P and K. Disease severity ratings and percent foliar N increased as N levels increased but were not influenced by the levels of P and K. In two other experiments, seven N sources were evaluated at three levels each. Plants receiving 160 ppm N had higher disease severity ratings than those receiving 0 or 40 ppm N. Among plants receiving 160 ppm N, those treated with calcium nitrate [Ca(NO3)2] had the least disease severity.
When N fertilizer is applied to strawberry plants as Ca(NO3)2, anthracnose crown rot severity should be less than when N is applied in ammonium forms. Anthracnose crown rot, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae, can infect all above-ground parts of the strawberry plant. Petiole and stolon infections are characterized by dark, sunken lesions, while leaf infections present as small black spots. When the crown is infected, it can lead to wilting and rapid plant death. An internal symptom of a crown infection is red discoloration, typically extending in a “V” shape from the side of the crown toward the center. Other pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum also cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.
In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.
However, the effect of nitrogen on disease management can vary depending on the disease. Ammonium sulfate has been shown to be more suppressive of black root rot in strawberries than Ca(NO3)2. The objectives of these studies were to determine (i) the influence of N, P, and K levels, and (ii) the influence of N source and concentration on the severity of anthracnose crown rot.

Plants of the strawberry cultivar Tangi and four clones from the USDA-ARS breeding program (MSUS 37, MSUS 74, MSUS 70, and MSUS 98) were grown in pasteurized sand, with one plant per 10-cm plastic pot in a greenhouse maintained at 20 ± 7°C. Within each experiment, the plants of each strawberry clone were randomly assigned to nitrogen (N) treatments. The nutrient solutions were prepared using a modified Hoagland's Nutrient Solution, containing the following components: (NH4)2SO4 or NH4NO3, NaH2PO4·H2O, KCl, CaCl2·2H2O, MgSO4·7H2O, Fe as Fe-chelate, MnCl2·4H2O, ZnSO4·7H2O, CuSO4·5H2O, H3BO3, CoCl2·6H2O, and MoO3. Fifty milliliters of the treatment solution was applied three times weekly to each pot. Pots were watered with tap water on alternate days and flushed with excess water once a week.
An average disease rating of 2.0 or less was considered a resistant response, a rating of 4.0 or greater was deemed susceptible, and a rating between 2.1 and 3.9 was classified as intermediate.
The effect of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K) levels was evaluated using 16 treatments. Eight N levels (0, 5, 10, 20, 40, 80, 160, and 320 ppm N) were applied as NH4NO3, combined with either low P and K (8.7 ppm P and 16.6 ppm K) or high P and K (35.8 ppm P and 66.4 ppm K). Phosphorus was provided as NaH2PO4 and potassium as KCl. The experimental design was a randomized complete block with five replications of one plant each for three strawberry clones (MSUS 37, MSUS 70, and MSUS 98). After five weeks of nutrient solution application, the photosynthesis rate of each plant was measured on the most recently fully expanded leaf using a portable photosynthesis system (LI-6400, Li-Cor Co. Ltd., Lincoln, NE) equipped with an infrared gas analyzer. The fourth and fifth leaves were collected from all plants, dried at 70°C, and analyzed for percent foliar N using the micro-Kjeldahl method.
Seven nitrogen sources [(NH4)2SO4, NH4Cl, (NH4)2HPO4, NH4NO3, NaNO3, KNO3, and Ca(NO3)2] were evaluated at three levels (0, 40, and 160 ppm N) on three strawberry clones (MSUS 37, MSUS 70, and MSUS 98) with five replications in Nitrogen Source Study I. The same seven nitrogen sources were evaluated at three levels (0, 40, and 120 ppm N) on four strawberry clones (Tangi, MSUS 70, MSUS 74, and MSUS 98) with four replications in Nitrogen Source Study II.
For all analyses, disease severity data were first transformed by adding 0.5 to the disease severity rating and then calculating the square root. Statistical analyses were performed using SAS software (Release 6.07, 1989; SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). When F-values were significant, mean comparisons were determined using the least significant difference at P = 0.05. Regression analysis was employed to assess the relationship between N treatment levels and disease ratings, foliar N content, and photosynthesis rates.

Table 2: Effect of nitrogen level applied with either low or high levels of phosphorus and potassium on disease ratings (DR) and percent foliar nitrogen (% FN) in strawberry plants grown in sand culture in the greenhouse. Means are based on five plants from each of three strawberry clones (MSUS 37, MSUS 70, and MSUS 98).
Each treatment solution also contained calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfur, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, cobalt, and molybdenum.
The pH of each solution was adjusted to 6.5 with 1N HCl or 1N NaOH.
Disease severity was rated on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (plant dead) 30 days after inoculation with Colletotrichum fragariae isolate CF-63.
Percent foliar nitrogen was determined by micro-Kjeldahl analysis.
Mean separation within columns was conducted using Least Significant Difference.
Foliar nitrogen increased as treatment nitrogen levels increased (as shown in Table 1 and Figure 1), but no effect was observed due to phosphorus and potassium levels. Significant differences in foliar nitrogen content were noted among the strawberry clones, with 'MSUS 98' having significantly higher foliar nitrogen than 'MSUS 70' and 'MSUS 37' (as detailed in Table 2). Across the three strawberry clones, the highest levels of foliar nitrogen were found in plants treated with 320, 160, or 80 ppm N, while the lowest levels were observed in those receiving 0, 5, or 10 ppm N. Generally, nitrogen levels of 2.0 to 3.0% are considered adequate for normal growth and development of strawberry plants, while levels below 2.0% are regarded as deficient. In these studies, plants with foliar nitrogen levels below 1.7% at the time of inoculation showed lower disease ratings compared to those with higher foliar nitrogen (as illustrated in Table 3). All three clones exhibited susceptible disease ratings when sufficient nitrogen was applied to achieve adequate foliar nitrogen levels (> 2%). 'MSUS 37' plants had a disease severity rating > 4.0 at a treatment nitrogen level of 60 ppm and foliar nitrogen content of 1.5%; 'MSUS 70' plants also rated > 4.0 at 100 ppm and 1.8% foliar nitrogen; 'MSUS 98' plants exceeded a rating of 4.0 at 120 ppm with a foliar nitrogen content of 2.0%.
Table 3: Average disease severity ratings (DR) at each foliar nitrogen level following the application of nutrient solutions containing various levels of nitrogen to strawberry plants grown in sand culture in the greenhouse.
The disease severity rating is averaged across 16 nutrient treatments and three strawberry clones (MSUS 37, MSUS 70, and MSUS 98) corresponding to each foliar nitrogen group.
Each treatment solution included calcium, magnesium, iron, sulfur, manganese, zinc, copper, boron, cobalt, and molybdenum, with the pH adjusted to 6.5 using 1N HCl or 1N NaOH.
Foliar nitrogen was determined using micro-Kjeldahl, and disease severity was rated on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (plant dead) 30 days after inoculation with Colletotrichum fragariae isolate CF-63.
Mean separation was conducted by Least Significant Difference, with a significance level of P = 0.05.
The photosynthesis rate in plants treated with lower nitrogen (N) concentrations was lowest, with measurements of 0.28 mg CO2/m/sec at 0 ppm N and increasing to 0.35 mg CO2/m/sec at 80 ppm N. This rate increased further in plants treated with 160 ppm N (0.47 mg CO2/m/sec) and nearly doubled in plants treated with 320 ppm N (0.87 mg CO2/m/sec). There was no significant effect on the photosynthesis rate due to phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) levels, nor was there a significant interaction between N level and strawberry clone.
Two studies evaluated the effect of seven nitrogen sources, each applied at three levels, on the severity of anthracnose crown rot. In Nitrogen Source Study I, significant differences were observed due to strawberry clone, N source, and N level, along with a notable interaction between N source and N level. 'MSUS 98' plants exhibited lower disease severity ratings compared to 'MSUS 37' or 'MSUS 70' when averaged across all treatments. Plants receiving 160 ppm N had higher disease severity ratings than those receiving 0 ppm N or 40 ppm N. The highest disease severity ratings were recorded for plants treated with 160 ppm of (NH4)2HPO4, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4Cl. Interestingly, plants receiving 160 ppm of Ca(NO3)2 had disease severity ratings comparable to those receiving no nitrogen, despite having leaf nitrogen content as high as any other treatment.
The results from Nitrogen Source Study II mirrored those of the first study. Plants of ‘Tangi’ and ‘MSUS 74’ displayed higher disease severity ratings than those of ‘MSUS 70’ and ‘MSUS 98’. Notably, plants receiving no nitrogen had lower disease severity ratings than those treated with 40 ppm N or 120 ppm N. The lowest disease ratings associated with nitrogen source were found in plants treated with Ca(NO3)2, KNO3, and NH4NO3.
Table 4 summarizes the analysis of variance results from both studies, detailing the impact of seven nitrogen treatments applied at three levels on anthracnose crown rot severity ratings. It indicates significant interactions between treatment factors.
Table 5 presents the main treatment effects, comparing disease severity ratings (DR) for different strawberry clones and nitrogen levels. Ratings are given on a scale of 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (plant dead) 30 days post-inoculation with Colletotrichum fragariae.
Table 6 details the effect of various nitrogen sources and levels on anthracnose crown rot ratings and percent foliar nitrogen (% FN). Each value is an average from five plants across different strawberry clones, showing how treatment levels influence disease ratings and nitrogen content in the leaves.
The application of nitrogen (N) in the form of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) significantly reduced the severity of anthracnose crown rot in strawberries. In contrast, the levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in fertilizers did not have a similar effect. Plants receiving N as Ca(NO3)2 exhibited fewer symptoms of anthracnose crown rot compared to those receiving N in ammonium form. Although these trials were conducted with potted plants in a greenhouse, the findings are applicable to strawberries grown in sandy soils, typical of Florida.
These results indicate that strawberry growers can adjust their fertilizer practices by opting for Ca(NO3)2 as their N source. This adjustment can help reduce the severity of anthracnose crown rot while ensuring adequate foliar N levels necessary for optimal growth and production. As anticipated, foliar N levels increased with higher treatment N levels, while P and K levels did not influence foliar N.
In a related study, the severity of anthracnose fruit rot, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, was also reduced with the application of Ca(NO3)2 on greenhouse-grown strawberries. Similar findings were reported regarding the control of Fusarium diseases in tomatoes and chrysanthemums. Notably, there was a significant variation in foliar N levels among different strawberry clones, suggesting that N applications should be customized for each cultivar. Nonetheless, the trend of decreased anthracnose severity with nitrate fertilizers was consistent across five strawberry clones tested, indicating that other cultivars may respond similarly.
