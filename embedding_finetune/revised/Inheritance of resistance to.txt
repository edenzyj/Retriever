In both experiments (Fig. 1), the data displayed a bimodal distribution, suggesting significant gene action. The substantial within-family variance not accounted for likely indicates epistatic effects. While underestimation of certain factors could inflate results, the similar estimates of 1.33 and 1.61 obtained using different genotypes and isolates across various years do not suggest such a bias. Wright (1956) hypothesized that substantial epistatic effects would be expected when biparental crosses are made in species that are normally propagated asexually. The importance of epistatic variance for various commercial traits has been highlighted in studies by Comstock et al. (1958), Hansche et al. (1968), Watkins and Spangelo (1968), Watkins et al. (1970), and Spangelo et al. (1971), suggesting it is a general phenomenon in strawberries. While epistatic effects are significant, those proposed in this study occurred within families and should not impact other variances computed from among-family comparisons (Shaw et al., 1989).
The validity of other assumptions under which additive and dominance variances are estimated appears reasonable to accept, although some are uncertain: 1) Regular diploid behavior of octoploid strawberries at meiosis was observed by Powers (1944) and Arulsekar et al. (1981). 2) The presence of minimal cytoplasmic or other maternal effects was supported by the relatively large variance; however, this would have been underestimated if such effects were considerable (Comstock et al., 1958). 3) The assumption of no correlation of genotypes at different loci may not be tenable in Experiment 1 but likely is in Experiment 2, as the parents constitute broadly based germplasm. Although the parents were related in some instances, they represent a random sample of the population of interest.
The high proportion of dominance variance in Experiment 2 compared to Experiment 1 may be attributed to the broader and more representative strawberry population sample in the former.
. A moderate level of broad-sense heritability (0.26 for males and 0.37 for females) was estimated for resistance to three isolates of C. fragariae. However, the broad-sense heritability estimates (0.85 for males and 0.87 for females) were very high.
A difference between the mean disease severity ratings of C. acutatum and C. fragariae in both experiments confirmed previous results (Smith and Black, 1990), indicating that C. acutatum produces a less severe plant disease reaction compared to C. fragariae. Although Colletotrichum acutatum is occasionally isolated from the crowns of dying plants in the field, it primarily acts as a fruit rot organism with the capability to cause crown rot.
The absence of significant genotype × isolate variance in both experiments suggested a similar genetic response to C. fragariae and C. acutatum, aligning with the findings of Smith and Black (1990), who reported that most cultivars responded similarly.
The Colletotrichum spp. and the race in question should probably be identified before initiating a breeding program, even though no genotype × isolate interaction was indicated in this study. This includes strawberry clones that were inoculated with Colletotrichum fragariae isolates CF-63, LA-1, Fla-1, and C. acutatum isolate Goff in Experiment 1, as well as C. fragariae isolates CF-63 and MS-9 and C. acutatum isolate Mil-1 in Experiment 2. The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was assessed, indicating that a multistage selection and breeding procedure would be efficient.
Within-family selection would allow for the introgression of new germplasm to introduce desirable characteristics and reduce inbreeding. Establishing a broad genetic base resistant to Colletotrichum spp. from which selections could be evaluated (using broad-sense heritability) and/or recombined to produce improved populations also appears feasible. Narrow-sense heritability estimates based on this study are likely sufficient to achieve moderate gains from recurrent selection. This conclusion is supported by observations of increased levels of resistance with successive cycles of selection following phenotypic assortative mating (B.J.S., unpublished data).
