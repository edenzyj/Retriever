ABSTRACT: Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae, is a serious problem in the southeastern United States, resulting in significant losses in strawberry nurseries. Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.
In laboratory tests, fungicidal properties were evaluated by exposing conidia to different fungicides and measuring growth after 24 hours. A concentration of less than 1% germination was considered fungistatic, indicating effective control of the pathogen. The tested concentrations for captafol were 1.0, 100, 100, and 500 µg a.i./ml, while for other fungicides like captan and maneb, the range was similarly assessed.
Field evaluations conducted in 1978 and 1979 included treatments applied every 7 days at rates of 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 g a.i./L. These trials revealed that disease severity was notably higher in the lower rate treatments, particularly in the susceptible cultivar 'Surecrop'. Plants were sourced from a registered planting at the Sandhills Research Station in Jackson Springs, NC, which had previously been treated with methyl bromide for weed control.
The experimental design consisted of plots with three plants spaced 0.6 m apart and rows spaced 1.2 m apart, with fungicide applications carried out from mid-May through September. Treatments included captafol, benomyl, maneb, and chlorothalonil, among others. Each treatment was replicated four times to ensure statistical validity.
In summary, while captafol demonstrated fungicidal activity against strawberry anthracnose, other fungicides like benomyl and maneb have shown reduced effectiveness in recent years, necessitating the ongoing evaluation of control strategies for this pervasive disease.
Carolina suggested the development of adjusted concentrations with a hemacytometer to create a resistant strain of C. fragariae at 0.6 and 1.9 g a.i./L. N. L. Horn (personal communication) recently confirmed the effectiveness of these treatments in Louisiana. The study involved seeding three cellophane disks at concentrations of 5 x 10^5 conidia per milliliter, which were maintained at 24-28°C and at a low temperature of 4°F for testing. The treatments included benomyl 50W at 0.6 g a.i./L and captan 50W at 2.4 g a.i./L, along with several other fungicides, for a total of six disks for each concentration.
The materials and methods outlined a laboratory bioassay to determine the in vitro action of the fungicides on C. fragariae using Neely and Himelick's cellophane diffusion technique. Table 1 presents the fungistatic and fungicidal concentrations of various fungicides against different C. fragariae isolates. The table lists fungicide names alongside their respective fungistatic and fungicidal concentrations in mg/ml for each isolate, including CF-1, CF-4, CF-7, CF-9, and CF-16.
For instance, captafol showed a consistent fungistatic/fungicidal ratio of 0.04/1.0 across all isolates, while captan displayed varying ratios, such as 0.2/20 for CF-1 and CF-4, and 1.0/100 for CF-7. Additionally, chlorothalonil demonstrated significant effectiveness with concentrations exceeding 500 mg/ml across most isolates. The study concluded that neither CGA 64251 nor triforine were effective against the C. fragariae isolates tested.

Germination studies indicated that concentrations of 0.04 and 1.0 µg/ml caused extensive branching and irregular growth of germ tubes. The infection plots exhibited varying levels of infection: those with a small infection rate (0-25%) had no significant lesions, while moderate infections (26-75%) showed moderate lesions. By mid-July to early August, the general infection loss among the plant runners ranged from slight (1-5%) to moderate (6-25%). The disease impact was significant, with a noted elongation of germ tubes at concentrations of 1.0-5.0 µg/ml of Chlorothalonil.
Captan was shown to reduce germination from 90% in the control group to 33% and 10% at 0.04 and 0.2 µg/ml, respectively. Triforine did not inhibit germination, but it reduced germ tube length from 251 µm in the control to 77 µm at 20 µg/ml. In cases of severe infection, average yield loss was significant, ranging from 51-100%, and the general loss varied by treatment concentration, with fungicidal concentrations ranging from 1 to 20 µg/ml.
Field evaluations conducted in 1978 revealed that anthracnose lesions developed on inoculated border row plants by late May, and treated plants displayed unsatisfactory control by early June. The disease progressed rapidly, leading to significant plant mortality, particularly for isolates except CF-9, which exhibited extreme disease pressure.
Results from the fungicide bioassay indicated that only 0.2 µg/ml slightly inhibited germination at 7-day intervals in July. Differences in disease indices were observed among the plots treated with various fungicides, with all cases except those treated with C. fragariae fungistatic fungicides showing varying effectiveness. Plots treated with captafol exhibited reduced disease compared to those with completely effective or ineffective treatments at lower concentrations.
By August 29, only the captafol-treated plots maintained acceptable disease levels, with disease indices ranging from 2.0 to 2.2. More than 50% of the plants were killed by anthracnose in all other plots. A significant yield difference was noted between captafol-treated plots and all other plots, marking the only statistical difference observed. Yield ranged from 368 to 403 plants per plot for captafol treatments, while plots treated with benomyl, maneb, and controls ranged from one to six plants per plot. None of the fungicides tested were found to be phytotoxic.
Table 2 summarizes the percent germination of Colletotrichum fragariae conidia after a 24-hour exposure to various concentrations of fungicides. The table presents data for five different fungicides: Captafol, Captan, Chlorothalonil, Maneb, and Triforine, across concentrations ranging from 0 to 20 µg/ml. The results show that Captafol had over 90% germination at the lowest concentration but showed a significant decline at higher concentrations, ultimately resulting in 0% germination at 20 µg/ml. Similarly, Captan and Chlorothalonil demonstrated a decrease in germination rates with increased concentrations. In contrast, Maneb maintained high germination rates across all tested concentrations until reaching 20 µg/ml, where it began to decline. The data highlight that Captafol was the most effective in inhibiting conidia germination, while the other fungicides also displayed varying levels of efficacy.
The table compares the effectiveness of various fungicides applied on two different schedules (7-day and 14-day) during the years 1979. The treatments included benomyl, captan, and maneb at different application rates, with results recorded for disease indices and yields over specific dates in August and September.
In the 7-day schedule, the disease index ranged from 3.7 for captafol at 4.8 g a.i./L to 5.0 for benomyl, maneb, and the control treatments, indicating that captafol provided the best disease control. Yields from the 7-day treatments varied significantly, achieving up to 78 plants per plot, while the 14-day treatments produced notably lower yields, between 30 and 1 plant per plot, reflecting the reduced efficacy of less frequent applications.
The results showed that disease development was more rapid with the 14-day spray schedule. For example, by August 1, captafol clearly outperformed other treatments. However, by August 29, none of the 14-day schedule treatments managed to achieve acceptable control of strawberry anthracnose. The disease indices for all treatments were consistently higher in 1979 compared to the previous year due to climatic factors affecting plant growth.
The study concluded that captafol was the most effective fungicide against C. fragariae, providing adequate control at concentrations of 1.2-2.4 g a.i./L when applied every 7 days. The mixture of captan and benomyl offered some control but was less effective than captafol. The findings suggest that maintaining the application of fungicides at appropriate intervals is crucial for managing strawberry anthracnose effectively.

A three-year survey of declining stands of alfalfa (Medicago sativa) in Alabama revealed several associated diseases. The main issues included crown rot caused by Sclerotinia trifoliorum and Rhizoctonia solani, along with summer anthracnose (Colletotrichum trifolii), black stem and leaf spot (Cercospora medicaginis), charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina), and nematode infestations affecting seedling stands. Notably, rust (Uromyces striatus) and nematode crown rot were reported for the first time in the state. Of the 15 Rhizoctonia solani isolates collected, 11 were pathogenic on seedling alfalfa. Additionally, six other fungi and eight nematodes were linked to alfalfa health issues.
Historically, alfalfa production in Alabama peaked at 2,000 hectares in the early 1950s but drastically declined by the late 1950s due to the introduction of the alfalfa weevil (Hypera postica). However, since 1975, alfalfa acreage has steadily increased, with current estimates around 1,200 hectares, and plans for further expansion. Alfalfa is impacted by at least 70 different pathogens, with approximately 30 known to significantly limit its production.
Economic control of alfalfa diseases is typically achieved through plant resistance. An alfalfa breeding program is currently underway at Auburn University. Additionally, several private seed companies have expressed interest in developing alfalfa cultivars specifically for the Southern region. Identifying and assessing the major diseases affecting alfalfa in the state will not only assist in making informed selections of available varieties but will also provide essential information regarding the disease resistance that should be incorporated into cultivars developed for Alabama and its neighboring areas. The purpose of this paper is to update the information presented in Plant Disease, November 1980.
