Abstract: Although hydroponic techniques enable intensive and effective crop management, controlling watering for each crop type and growth stage is challenging with commonly used timed watering systems. This often results in excessive or insufficient watering. Hydroponic technology that considers drainage rates can minimize drainage amounts, thereby reducing environmental pollution and fertilizer consumption. This study compared drainage rates and timed watering methods in a strawberry hydroponic system to determine the optimal drainage rate. As the drainage rate increased, the amount of water supplied also increased. A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. The drainage electrical conductivity (EC) level was highest in the 10% drainage rate group. In the 20% drainage rate treatment, leaf length and width increased compared to the four applications of the timer-supplying method. The yield of fruits weighing more than 27 g was highest in the 20% drainage rate treatment, indicating it was the most appropriate. We propose that it is possible to reduce unnecessary fertilizer consumption and increase productivity by managing water supply through drainage rates for precise water supply management in strawberries.
Korean strawberry production amounted to 1.23 billion won and 163 thousand tons in 2020. It ranked first among horticultural crops and is a primary income crop for farms. In 2021, the greenhouse strawberry cultivation area was 6057 ha, while open field cultivation accounted for only 46 ha, less than 1% of the total strawberry cultivation area. The hydroponic cultivation area for strawberries expanded to 1596 ha in 2020. Hydroponics using an artificial substrate can provide physical and chemical conditions suitable for nutrient absorption by plants. Intensive and effective crop management can be achieved through hydroponic techniques that supply nutrients using a nutrient solution in the substrates. In hydroponics, water supply control is performed to maintain...

The high usage volumes of the nutrient solution increase production costs, and the residual fertilizer in the discharged nutrient solution results in environmental pollution [12]. Vegetable crops can grow under conditions of low nutrient concentration when the rhizosphere buffering capacity is high [13]. This means that in hydroponics, the yield and quality of crops are not significantly affected by short-term nutrient depletion [14]. Therefore, it is possible to adopt strategies to reduce nutrient discharge during hydroponics cultivation and improve the efficiency of water and nutrients by controlling the amount of nutrient solution discharged [15]. Hydroponic technology that considers the drainage rate can reduce fertilizer consumption by supplying the necessary levels of water and nutrients to minimize drainage and prevent environmental pollution [16].
This study was conducted to determine an appropriate watering method by comparing the irrigation characteristics of the timed and drainage rate watering control methods, which are commonly used in hydroponic strawberry cultivation. Additionally, we analyzed the growth and quality of strawberries cultivated using each watering method.
This experiment was conducted in a single plastic greenhouse (width: 7 m, length: 40 m) at the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science in Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do. A multi-pot with eight planting spaces (Multicup pot type A; Hwasung Industrial Co., Ltd., Jinju, Korea) was placed on high beds (28 cm width, 90 cm bed distance) and filled with a horticultural strawberry substrate (Chamgeuro Industrial Co., Ltd., Hongseong, Korea). On 9 August 2021, one dripper (Netafim, Hatzerim, Israel) was inserted into each pot to water the substrate with groundwater (EC 0.34 dS/m).
Drainage was collected at 3-day intervals for each treatment to analyze the electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of the irrigation and drainage solutions. The EC and pH were measured using an EC and pH meter (Eutech PC 450 Multi-parameter Meter Kit; Thermo Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). Water Use Efficiency (WUE), an index indicating the growth of the aerial parts and fruit yield relative to the plant’s retained water content, was calculated by dividing the retained water content by the fresh weight of the plant's aerial parts and fruits.
Growth, fruit quality, and yield characteristics of strawberries were measured following the Vegetable Research Data Standard Manual by the Rural Development Administration [18]. Measurements for 30 plants included plant height, petiole length, leaf number, leaf length, leaf width, and crown diameter. The fresh weight, dry weight, and leaf area were measured for 15 plants. Among fully developed leaves, petiole length, leaf width, and leaf length were measured using the third-newest leaf. Crown diameter was measured with a digital caliper (CD-20CPX; Mitutoyo Corp., Kawasaki, Japan) at the maximum diameter of the crown. Plant fresh weight was measured using an electronic scale (CAS Co., Ltd.; Seoul, Korea), and dry weight was determined after drying for 72 hours in a dryer (DS-80-3; Dasol Scientific Co., Ltd., Hwaseong, Korea) at 75°C. Leaf area was measured by removing all leaves from the crown and using a leaf area meter (Li-3100; LI-COR Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA). Fruit quality characteristics assessed included soluble solids content, firmness, acidity, sugar-to-acid ratio, weight, length, width, and color.
The photosynthetic capacity of the third-newest leaf from three plants was measured on clear days on 28 April, 3 May, and 6 May 2022, during the late harvest season, to determine the assimilation rate of strawberry plants under each watering treatment. The CO₂ response curve was measured using a photosynthetic meter (LI-6800; LI-COR Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA) at an airflow rate of 400 μmol s⁻¹, a temperature of 25°C, and a CO₂ concentration range from 0 to 1200 μmol mol⁻¹.
Fruits were harvested weekly from 14 December to 28 March. Marketable fruits were classified into seven weight categories: more than 42 g, 37–42 g, 32–37 g, 27–32 g, 22–27 g, 17–22 g, and 12–17 g. Fruits weighing less than 12 g were categorized as small fruits, and those deformed due to insufficient pollination were classified as malformed. The percentage of marketable fruits was calculated by excluding the small and malformed fruits.
The aerial and root parts of the plants were separated for inorganic content analysis according to the Rural Development Administration's research and analysis standards [19]. The material was dried in a dryer at 75°C for 72 hours and then pulverized. Subsequently, 0.5 g of the dried material was used for further analysis.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and 2-way ANOVA were performed using the Sigmaplot program (SigmaPlot 8.0; Systat Software, Inc., Chicago, IL, USA) and the R program (R 4.0.2; R Foundation). Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT) was applied, and p < 0.05 was deemed significant for all tests.
The amount of water supplied and drainage collected during the cultivation period is shown in Figure 1. The fixed watering method set at six events (Timer 2) had the highest amount of watering at 239.6 mL, while the method set at four watering events (Timer 1) had the lowest amount at 157.3 mL. When water supply was controlled based on the drainage rate, 161.1, 173.3, and 183.8 mL were supplied at drainage rates of 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively. For the four-times watering setting, the amount of water supplied was similar to that of the 10% drainage rate control. As drainage rates decreased, the amount of water provided also decreased. Specifically, the amount of water supplied for the 10% drainage treatment was 12.4% lower than for the 30% drainage treatment and 32.8% lower than for the six-times fixed timer method. A lower drainage standard means it takes longer to reach the drainage threshold, which signals the point of irrigation. This result aligns with prior research on water supply control that considers factors such as insolation and substrate water content [7], as well as irrigation programs using integrated indoor solar radiation [20].
The average daily drainage per plant was 126.7 mL when set for six applications, which was 57.6% higher than for the 30% drainage rate treatment and 162.2% higher than the 10% drainage rate treatment. The four-application timer and the 10% drainage rate method had similar nutrient solution supply and drainage amounts. The six-application timer resulted in excessive supply and drainage, indicating nutrient solution wastage. Given that greenhouse crop growth is influenced by various environmental factors, such as light [21], root temperature [22], humidity [23], EC level [24], and oxygen content of the solution [25], it is challenging to establish optimal growth conditions using only a timer, as this method does not account for these factors.
The EC levels of irrigation and drainage solutions were monitored throughout the cultivation period (Figure 2). The irrigation EC level across all treatments averaged 1.25 ± 0.007 dS m⁻¹. Drainage EC levels, however, varied by the supply method used: the EC levels in drainage were 1.87, 1.76, 1.71, 2.06, and 1.57 dS m⁻¹ for the 10%, 20%, 30%, four-time, and six-time timed application treatments, respectively. The four-times timed application treatment group exhibited the highest drainage EC level—31.2% higher than the six-times timed application treatment and 20.5% higher than the 30% drainage rate group. When watering was controlled based on a 10% drainage rate, the maximum drainage EC level reached 2.65 dS m⁻¹, a relatively high level. This is consistent with previous findings where reduced drainage rates in melon hydroponics led to higher drainage EC levels when supply EC was high and water supply was low [9]. The irrigation solution pH averaged 6.81 ± 0.03 across all treatments, while drainage pH was 7.11 ± 0.06, with no significant difference between treatments (data not shown).

Irrigation and drainage EC levels of strawberry ‘Seolhyang’ affected by the nutrient solution supply system, using different drainage rate levels and timings (Drainage rate: 10%, 20%, or 30%; Timer 1: timer set for 4 applications daily; Timer 2: timer set for 6 applications daily). Vertical bars indicate standard errors of the means (n = 3).
The effects of the watering methods on strawberry growth characteristics are presented in Table 1. During the early growth stage, there was no significant difference among the watering methods. However, during the late growth period, the drainage rate control method led to increased leaf length and width compared to the timer control method. Specifically, with a 20% drainage rate, leaf length and width increased by 14.1% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the four-times timer-supplying method, and by 23.6% and 29.5% compared to the six-times timer-supplying method. A lower rhizosphere water content, caused by a reduced drainage rate, increases root water stress, thereby inhibiting nutrient absorption and reducing plant and leaf area [26]. Leaf area was lowest at 1173 mm² in the treatment with four daily watering events and highest at 1586 mm² in the 20% drainage rate treatment, though the difference was not statistically significant (data not shown).

Growth characteristics of strawberry ‘Seolhyang’ affected by the nutrient solution supply system using different drainage rate levels and timings at 159 (early harvest season) and 218 (late harvest season) days after transplanting (Drainage rate: 10%, 20%, or 30%; Timer 1: timer set for 4 applications daily; Timer 2: timer set for 6 applications daily). Mean separation within columns by Duncan's multiple range test (DMRT) at the 5% level. Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between treatments.
By examining the fresh and dry weight of both the aerial and root parts of the plant (Figures 3 and 4), it was found that the group treated with six daily watering events, which received the largest amount of water, had the highest fresh weight at 110.9 g per plant. The fresh weight in the group treated with a 10% drainage rate was 25.3% lower than in Timer 2, at 88.5 g per plant. For the aerial part, the dry weight was lowest in the 10% drainage treatment group, at 23.8 g per plant, though this difference was not statistically significant. The average root fresh weight was 222 ± 11.4 g, and the dry weight was 37.6 ± 1.93 g, with no significant difference between treatments.
The CO₂ fixation rate of plant leaves reflects photosynthetic capacity, providing an index for assessing the photosynthetic performance of plants under environmental stress [27]. At a CO₂ concentration of 1200 µmol mol⁻¹, the assimilation rate for the drainage treatment ranged from 29.4 ± 1.44 µmol m⁻² mol⁻¹ (Figure 5), with no significant difference compared to the timer-supplying method. This finding aligns with previous studies, which observed no significant difference in photosynthetic rate between watering methods that use frequency domain reflectometry (FDR) sensors and those using a timer [10].
Figure 4 shows the differences in the rhizosphere of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ based on the nutrient solution supply system, which varies according to different drainage rate levels and timers. The drainage rates examined were 10%, 20%, and 30%, with two timers used: Timer 1, which was set for four applications daily, and Timer 2, which was set for six applications daily.
Figure 5 presents the CO2 response curves of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ influenced by the nutrient solution supplying system at various drainage rate levels and timers. Similar to Figure 4, the drainage rates of 10%, 20%, or 30% and the two timers (Timer 1 and Timer 2) were used. Vertical bars in the figure indicate the standard errors of the means, with n = 3.
A significantly negative correlation was observed between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content, as depicted in Figure 6. The study found that different irrigation levels significantly affected all nutrients. These results align with previous findings, which reported increased concentrations of calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) in strawberry leaves when provided with 30% to 50% less irrigation water compared to control conditions. The correlation coefficients between potassium (K) and magnesium (Mg) as well as K and Ca were also noteworthy.

Vertical bars indicate standard errors of the means (n = 3).

There were no significant differences in soluble solid content (12.1 ± 0.18 Brix) or acidity across treatments. A correlation analysis showed positive relationships between the soluble solid-acid ratio and various leaf metrics: leaf number (r = 0.60), leaf length (r = 0.62), and leaf width (r = 0.55). This indicates that larger leaves correlate with a lower soluble solid-acid ratio.
Different lowercase letters indicate significant differences (p < 0.05) between treatments, per DMRT.
During the cultivation period, water absorption data revealed that plants receiving six daily applications (Timer 2) had the highest total water supply at 21.5 L per plant, 48.3% higher than the 10% drainage treatment at 14.5 L. Total retained volume was highest in the 10% drainage treatment group (10.1 L), 8.6% more than the 30% drainage rate treatment. Water use efficiency (WUE) was lowest for the 10% drainage and Timer 1 treatments, with values of 43.6 g/L. WUE increased by 13.8% in the 30% drainage treatment compared to the Timer 1 group, suggesting that water control by drainage rate enhances aerial growth and fruit productivity while reducing fertilizer use.
As a result of the correlation analysis between total supply/drainage per plant, water content, and water use efficiency (WUE) (see Figure 9), the correlation coefficients for total water supply and total drainage were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively, indicating a significant positive correlation. The correlation coefficient for WUE was...
