The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).
Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic "guides," the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. Â© 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al. (1994).
This review focuses on current research into the infection process of Colletotrichum species, with an overall emphasis on how signal transduction influences pre-penetration morphogenesis, including conidiation, conidial attachment, conidial germination, germ tube formation, and appressorial differentiation. Post-penetration biotrophic and necrotrophic growth patterns will also be described. Additionally, intriguing studies involving host specificity and chromosome transfer will be summarized.
A serine/threonine kinase gene (elk1) expressed by C. lindemuthianum and required for pathogenicity on P. vulgaris has been identified through insertional mutagenesis (Dufresne et al., 1998). The gene is constitutively expressed; however, the mutant cannot penetrate host tissues. Additionally, mutants of C. graminicola with unpigmented spores or weakened cell walls have been recently identified using restriction enzyme-mediated integration (REMI) (Epstein et al., 1998). Developmentally regulated proteins in C. lindemuthianum have been identified and characterized using monoclonal antibodies (MAbs) (Green et al., 1995). These MAbs were raised either against homogenates of germlings grown in liquid culture (Pain et al., 1992) or against infection structures isolated from bean leaves (Pain et al., 1994a, b). Recently, one of these MAbs (UB25) was employed as a probe for expression cloning, leading to the isolation of a gene encoding a fungal glycoprotein that is present at the biotrophic interface in host cells (Perfect et al., 1998; see later).
