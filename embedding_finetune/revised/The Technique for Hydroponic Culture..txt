Hydroponics involves soilless cultures where plants are grown using a mineral nutrient solution instead of soil. This method optimizes root access to water, oxygen, and nutrients while providing the necessary physical, chemical, and biological support to the plants. When setting up a hydroponic garden or home system, it is crucial to select an appropriate space and technique. Hydroponic systems can be categorized as open or closed methods, where the hydroponic system refers to the method of delivering nutrient solutions to the plant roots. Hydroponics has gained significant popularity in a short time, enabling both indoor and outdoor hydroponic planting to be initiated quickly.
Historically, hydroponics has been practiced for centuries in civilizations such as those in the Amazon, Babylon, Egypt, China, and India, where ancient peoples utilized dissolved nutrients to grow crops like cucumbers and watermelons in sandy riverbeds. The "Hanging Gardens of Babylon" and the Aztec floating farms are notable examples of hydroponic systems. Later, plant physiologists began cultivating plants with specific nutrients for experimental purposes, coining the term "nutriculture." This method was developed in 1925 as greenhouse soils needed to be frequently replaced to address issues related to soil structure, fertility, and pests.
The term "hydroponics" derives from the Latin words “hydro,” meaning water, and “ponos,” meaning work. Various human civilizations throughout history have relied on hydroponics for plant cultivation, notably early Mexican and Egyptian societies. Recently, hydroponic cultivation has surged in popularity and application across diverse markets. Hydroponics allows plants to grow using a mineral nutrient solution instead of soil. Studies show that plants grown hydroponically can develop at a faster rate, mature earlier, and yield up to three times the output of soil-grown plants, providing greater nutritional value as well.
Buffer action of water or the inert medium used.
The nutrient solution or fertilizer mixture must contain all essential micro and macro elements necessary for plant growth and development.
The buffer action of the nutrient solution should be within a suitable range to avoid affecting the plant root system or inert medium.
Temperature and aeration of the inert medium or nutrient solution must be appropriate for the plant root system.
The term hydroponics originally referred to nutrient solution cultures without a supporting medium. However, the classification has evolved to include various soilless cultivation methods.

In these systems, the nutrient solution is circulated through the plant root system, with excess solution collected, renewed, and reused.
NFT is a true hydroponic system where plant roots are directly exposed to a nutrient solution. This system maintains a continuous flow of nutrient solution, eliminating the need for timers for the submersible pump. The nutrient solution is pumped into a growing tray, usually a tube, where it flows over the plant roots and drains back into the reservoir. Typically, no growing medium is used apart from air, which reduces the cost of replacing the growing medium after each harvest. Plants are usually supported in small plastic baskets with roots dangling into the nutrient solution. However, NFT systems are vulnerable to power outages and pump failures, as roots can dry out quickly if the nutrient flow is interrupted.
The channel is made from flexible sheet material, where seedlings with minimal growing medium are placed at the center, and the edges are drawn to the base of the seedlings and sealed to prevent evaporation and block light. The growing medium absorbs the nutrient solution for young plants, and as they mature, roots form a tangle within the channels.
The maximum length of the channel ranges from 5 to 10 meters, set at a slope of 1 in 50 to 1 in 75. Nutrient solution is pumped to the upper end of each channel and flows by gravity to the lower end, wetting the root tangle. At the lower end, the nutrient solution collects and flows back to the nutrient solution tank. The solution is monitored for salt concentration before being reused. Some growers replace the nutrient solution regularly with a fresh mix. The flow rate of the nutrient solution is adjusted to 2-3 liters per minute, depending on the channel length. It is crucial to provide sufficient support for tall plants in this method. Maintaining a very thin film of nutrient solution is challenging, leading to various modifications in this technique.
As the name suggests, the nutrient solution flows through 2-3 cm deep in 10 cm wide PVC pipes, with plastic net pots containing plants fitted into them. The pots hold planting materials, and their bottoms contact the nutrient solution circulating in the pipes. The PVC pipes can be arranged either in a single plane or in various shapes, depending on the types of crops being grown.

Figure 2: Deep flow technique.
When the recycled nutrient solution falls into the stock tank, the nutrient solution becomes aerated. The PVC pipes must have a slope of 1 in 30 to 40 to facilitate the flow of the nutrient solution. Painting the PVC pipes white will help reduce the heating of the nutrient solution. This system can be set up in open spaces or in protected structures.
Plants are grown in small pots filled with a growing medium. The pots are arranged so that the lower 2-3 cm are submerged in the nutrient solution. Some roots are submerged in the solution while others remain above it for nutrient and air absorption.

This process is simple and can be developed using readily available materials. This 'low-tech' growing technique is inexpensive to construct and requires minimal maintenance. Importantly, this method does not require costly items such as electricity, water pumps, or filters. However, for root crops (like beets and radishes), a dormant medium must be used.
This method is similar to the box technique, but shallow containers (10 cm deep) can be used. Plants established in small pots are attached to a Styrofoam sheet or another lightweight board and allowed to float on the nutrient solution in the container, which is artificially aerated.
Planting pots of various sizes and shapes with holes at the base are used. The pots are filled with a dormant medium, and seedlings or seeds are planted in this medium. These pots are placed in shallow containers filled with the nutrient solution. The nutrient solution reaches the dormant medium through capillary action. Air circulation is crucial in this method, so old coir dust mixed with sand or gravel can be utilized. This technique is suitable for decorative plants, flowering plants, and indoor plants.
Tannins and acids present in newly processed coir dust can affect plants; therefore, coir dust should be at least six months old. Dry, clean, compacted coir dust blocks are available for sale.
Approximately 1m long, chamber-shaped, white (with black interiors), UV-treated, thick polyethylene bags filled with sanitized coconut fiber are used. These bags are sealed at the base and attached to a small PVC pipe at the top. The bags are suspended vertically from an overhead support above a nutrient solution collection channel. Consequently, this technique is also known as the 'vertical growing' method.

Seedlings or other planting materials are placed in net pots and crushed into openings on the sides of the hanging packs. The nutrient solution is siphoned to the top of each balancing pack through a smaller scale sprinkler attached inside the hanging sacks at the top. This miniaturized sprinkler evenly distributes the nutrient solution within the hanging pack. The nutrient solution drips down, wetting the coconut fiber and plant roots. Excess solution collects in the channel underneath through openings made at the base of the hanging sacks and flows back to the nutrient solution stock tank. This system can be set up in open spaces or secured structures. In secured structures, the balancing packs in the rows and between the lines must be spaced adequately to allow sufficient daylight to reach the sacks in the inner rows.
This system is suitable for leafy vegetables, strawberries, and small flowering plants. Black-colored tubes should be used for nutrient solution delivery to prevent mold growth inside.
In this method, 1 to 1.5-meter-long white (with a black interior), UV-resistant polyethylene bags filled with old, disinfected coir dust are utilized. These bags are approximately 6 cm in height and 18 cm in width. They are arranged end to end horizontally in rows on the floor, leaving walking space in between. The bags may be positioned in paired rows depending on the crop being grown. Small openings are made on the upper surface of the bags, into which seedlings or other planting materials are pressed, placed in net pots within the coir dust. Two to three plants can be established per bag. Two small cuts low on each side of the bags allow for drainage. Fertigation is practiced using black slender tubes leading from the main supply line to each plant. The entire floor is covered with white UV-resistant polyethylene before placing the bags. This white polyethylene reflects sunlight onto the plants and reduces the relative humidity between plants, thereby decreasing the incidence of fungal diseases.
The trench or trough technique involves an open system where plants are grown in narrow channels either in the ground or in above-ground troughs constructed with blocks or concrete blocks. Both channels and troughs are lined with waterproof material (thick UV-resistant polyethylene sheets in two layers) to separate the growing media from the surrounding ground. The width of the channel or trough can be chosen based on operational convenience; wider channels or troughs can accommodate two rows of plants. The depth varies depending on the plants being grown, with a minimum of 30 cm often necessary. Old coir waste, sand or gravel, peat, vermiculite, perlite, old sawdust, or a mix of these materials can be used as the growing media. The nutrient solution and water are supplied through a drip irrigation system, though manual application is also possible, depending on labor availability. A well-punctured drain of 2.5 cm in diameter may be installed at the bottom of the trough or channel to drain excess nutrient solution. Tall, climbing plants (such as cucumbers and tomatoes) require additional support to bear the weight of their fruits.
The pot method is similar to the trench or trough culture, but the growing media is placed in clay or plastic pots. The volume of the container and growing media depends on the growth requirements of the crops, typically ranging from 1 to 10 liters. The management of growing media, nutrient solution supply, and support for plants is similar to that of the trench or trough culture.

The unit floor area in different frameworks offers another potential utilization of hydroponic techniques for producing soil-free plants from cuttings for export.
The aeroponic system is likely the most advanced type of hydroponic planting. Like the Nutrient Film Technique (NFT), the growing medium is primarily air. The roots hang in the air and are moistened with a nutrient solution. Because the roots are exposed to the air, similar to the NFT system, they can dry out quickly if the misting cycles are interrupted.
Hydroponic culture is rapidly gaining momentum and popularity, becoming one of the fastest-growing areas in agriculture. It is particularly well-accepted in some countries, especially for commercial vegetable production, and is quickly being adopted in various parts of the world. However, in developing countries, this method has not gained popularity among growers. The primary barrier to its adoption is the lack of standard knowledge and poor dissemination of available technologies. This review article aims to provide methods for hydroponic practices to growers and raise awareness at the national level regarding potential hydroponic applications.
