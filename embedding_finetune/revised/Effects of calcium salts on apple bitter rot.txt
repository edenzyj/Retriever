Biggs, A. R. 1999. Effects of calcium salts on apple bitter rot caused by two Colletotrichum spp. Plant Disease 83:1001-1005.
The effects of three calcium salts on conidial germination, germ tube elongation, growth in vitro, and infectivity in the laboratory and field were studied for the apple bitter rot pathogens, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. Calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate, at 1,000 µg of calcium per ml, had no effect on conidial germination; however, calcium chloride and calcium propionate inhibited germ tube growth by 41% and 50% relative to the control, respectively. All three calcium salts reduced fungal dry weight in liquid culture media.
When calcium salt solutions were applied to wounded apples prior to inoculation, fruits treated with calcium chloride and calcium propionate exhibited lesions that were 30% smaller than those treated with calcium silicate or the control, which were similar. Fruits treated with calcium chloride and calcium propionate also showed delayed formation of acervuli compared to the control and calcium silicate treatments, which were similar. When fruits were inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia, ranging from 1 × 10³ to 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, those treated with calcium chloride exhibited a reduced incidence of infection after inoculation with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml. In all tests with 1 × 10⁴ and 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, the control and calcium salt treatments resulted in similar incidences of infection.
In six field trials, where fruits received three weekly dilute applications of calcium solutions, those treated with calcium salts and then inoculated with conidia of either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum exhibited lower incidences of infection compared to the control fruits. These experiments demonstrate that calcium salts have suppressive activity against the bitter rot pathogens and could be integrated into a disease management program.
Bitter rot, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (teleomorph = Glomerella cingulata) and C. acutatum, is a destructive fruit rot affecting apples and pears in the southern, central, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and in many other countries where these fruits are cultivated. The application of supplemental calcium to apples is a routine practice in orchards prone to calcium-related nutritional disorders such as cork spot and bitter pit. The most common form of calcium supplement used is calcium chloride (in 75% food-grade flakes); however, many proprietary products containing calcium in other forms or combined with additional nutrients are also available.
Calcium supplements are typically applied starting 2 to 4 weeks after petal fall and may continue through the preharvest period for as many as eight applications. Recommended rates of calcium chloride range from 17 to 56 kg/ha per year, based on the potential severity of nutritional disorders. The development of effective fungicides has reduced the prevalence of the disease compared to the past, although significant fruit losses from bitter rot can still occur during years with conducive weather conditions.
Scientific article 2724 of the West Virginia Agricultural and Forestry Experiment Station discusses research on enhancing storage quality and reducing decay in apples through calcium supplementation. Accepted for publication on 13 July 1999, this study focuses on the postharvest environment (6–10). Few studies have explored the potential role of calcium supplementation during the preharvest period for disease reduction. The trials aimed to determine whether the use of calcium salts affected fungal growth and disease incidence, both in vitro and in vivo.
Fungal Isolates: Fungal isolates were obtained from K. S. Yoder at Virginia Tech’s Winchester Agricultural Research and Extension Center. They were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in Petri dishes, subcultured weekly, and kept at 22°C during experiments. Conidia for inoculum were harvested from seven-day-old cultures. For long-term storage, cultures were preserved on PDA in culture tubes at 4°C. Conidia were harvested by flooding the dishes with sterile distilled water, scraping the plates with a rubber spatula, and filtering the suspension through four layers of sterile cheesecloth. Desired concentrations of conidia were prepared by diluting original suspensions after counting them with a hemacytometer.
Effects of Calcium Salts on Spore Germination, Germ Tube Elongation, and Mycelial Growth In Vitro: The pure calcium salts used in this study included calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate. These salts were chosen based on preliminary studies assessing their in vitro activity on the growth of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. To evaluate the effects of calcium salts on conidia germination, the salts were prepared in sterile deionized distilled water and added to autoclaved warm (45 to 55°C) 2% water agar (WA) to achieve a final concentration of 1,000 mg of calcium per liter. The medium was poured into 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes, with control dishes containing WA medium without calcium. Five 30-µl droplets of freshly prepared conidia suspension from each fungus were placed on each of three replicate dishes. Germination was assessed by examining 50 conidia from each droplet after 8 hours at 22°C. A conidium was considered germinated if the germ tube was longer than half the length of the conidium. This experiment was conducted twice.
For assessing germ tube elongation, the same procedure was followed, except that 25 germ tubes from each droplet were measured with an ocular micrometer after 14 hours at 22°C. This experiment was also conducted twice. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance, and means were separated using the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
To evaluate the effects of calcium salts on mycelial growth, salts were prepared in sterile deionized distilled water and added to autoclaved warm (45 to 55°C) 2% potato dextrose broth (PDB) at concentrations ranging from 600 to 1,200 mg of calcium per liter. The media were poured into 250-ml stationary flasks. A 30-µl drop of a suspension containing 1 × 10^5 conidia from either fungus was added to each flask. Flasks were incubated in the dark at 20 ± 2°C, and growth was assessed after 14 days by determining the dry weight of the mycelium. This experiment was performed three times with three replicate flasks per treatment, and results were subjected to regression analysis (SAS).
In a second set of experiments, fruits were prepared as described above and then inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia ranging from 1 × 10³ to 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml. This experiment was conducted four times. The first trial took place in 1996 with the cultivar Nittany, while the remaining trials were conducted in 1997 using the cultivar Golden Delicious. Data on disease incidence and lesion diameter were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated using the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS).
Effects of field applications of calcium salts on apple fruit regarding the incidence and severity of bitter rot were studied in 1997 (Golden Delicious) and 1998 (Nittany). Fruit on trees that had not been sprayed with fungicides were treated with calcium chloride, calcium propionate, or calcium silicate (1997 only) or calcium hydroxide (1998 only) at a concentration of 1,200 mg of calcium per liter. Each set of 10 fruits per treatment was sprayed to runoff with 1,200 mg of calcium per liter plus 0.1% Nufilm 17 (Miller Chemical Co., Biglerville, PA) weekly for three consecutive weeks. Preliminary tests with Nufilm 17 confirmed that the adjuvant had no effect on fruit infection by Colletotrichum spp. The day following the third calcium application, attached fruit were inoculated with either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum. Inoculations were made by preparing suspensions of conidia as described above, immersing 2.5-cm-wide cheesecloth strips (four layers thick) into the suspensions, and wrapping the strips around the widest part of the fruit. The strips were secured with one layer each of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. The inoculum was removed after 5 to 7 days. Control treatments included fruits sprayed with distilled water and inoculated, as well as non-sprayed fruits that were inoculated without conidia. The experiment was conducted three times in each of the two years. All fruit from the three trials in each year were harvested at the normal harvest date for the specific cultivar. The harvested fruits were arranged in labeled trays and were observed weekly for disease incidence, defined as the presence of bitter rot, determined from visible sporulation or reisolation when necessary. Data on disease incidence were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated using the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS).
Table Description: Table 1 presents the lengths of germ tubes from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum conidia placed on water agar amended with 1,000 mg of calcium per liter, using different calcium sources: calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate. The results show that the average germ tube lengths varied significantly between treatments. C. gloeosporioides had the shortest germ tube length with calcium chloride (46.9 µm) and the longest with calcium silicate (73.5 µm). For C. acutatum, germ tube lengths were also longest with calcium chloride (49.7 µm) and shortest with calcium propionate (21.5 µm). The data indicate significant differences in germ tube lengths across treatments, with statistical letters denoting significance according to the Waller-Duncan test (P = 0.05). The effect of the trial was found to be not significant (Bartlett’s test), allowing for the combination of data from separate trials.
Effects of calcium salts on conidial germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth in vitro were also investigated. At 1,000 mg of calcium per liter, neither calcium chloride, calcium propionate, nor calcium silicate affected conidial germination in vitro. However, calcium chloride inhibited germ tube growth of C. gloeosporioides by 41% and of C. acutatum by 50% relative to the control, while calcium propionate inhibited germ tube growth of C. gloeosporioides by 48% and of C. acutatum by 80%.
After 14 days in potato dextrose broth amended with calcium chloride (light bars) or calcium propionate (dark bars), calcium propionate reduced fungal dry weight (Fig. 1).
Wounds treated with calcium chloride and then inoculated exhibited lesions that were 20% to 29% smaller than the control for Colletotrichum acutatum and 22% to 26% smaller for C. gloeosporioides (Table 2). Similarly, wounds treated with calcium propionate had lesions that were 26% smaller than the control for C. acutatum and 24% to 34% smaller than the control for C. gloeosporioides (Table 2). Lesion diameter for wounds treated with calcium silicate was similar to the control, except in Trial 2 with C. gloeosporioides, where lesions were 17% smaller (Table 2). Lesions developing from treatment with C. acutatum showed delayed formation of acervuli compared to the control, while this delay was not observed with C. gloeosporioides.
Wounded fruit of both cultivars pre-treated with calcium chloride and then inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia exhibited a reduced incidence of infection, showing 62% to 87% less than the control after inoculation with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml of either fungus (Table 3). Golden Delicious, but not Nittany, fruit treated with calcium propionate and calcium silicate also showed reduced disease incidence after inoculation with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml of either fungus (Table 3). In tests at concentrations of 1 × 10⁴ and 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, no consistent treatment effects were observed, with only three exceptions among the 32 treatment combinations; the control and calcium salt treatments exhibited similar incidences of infection after inoculating wounded fruit.
Fruit of both cultivars treated with calcium chloride exhibited smaller lesions (63% to 72%) after inoculations with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml of C. acutatum (Table 4). Similarly, lesions were 30% to 75% smaller after inoculations of calcium chloride-treated fruit with 1 × 10³ conidia of C. gloeosporioides per ml (Table 4). Fruit of both cultivars treated with calcium propionate also exhibited smaller lesions (22% to 70%) after inoculations with 1 × 10³ conidia of C. acutatum per ml (Table 4), whereas lesions were 50% smaller for Golden Delicious fruit treated with calcium propionate and inoculated with C. gloeosporioides (Table 4). Golden Delicious, but not Nittany, fruit also exhibited reduced severity after inoculation with all three inoculum concentrations of either fungus (Table 4). For Nittany, in tests at 1 × 10⁴ and 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, the control and calcium salt treatments showed similar infection severity.
In six separate field trials conducted over two years, fruit treated with weekly dilute applications of calcium showed lower incidences of infection compared to the controls (Tables 5 and 6). In 1997, Golden Delicious inoculated with either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum had lower incidences of infection compared to the control fruit, which became visibly infected between the first and second assessments.
Table 2 summarizes the lesion diameters at 7 days and the acervulus development ratings at 7 and 9 days following the inoculation of wounded Nittany apples with conidia of C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum. The table lists various treatments: calcium propionate, calcium chloride, calcium silicate, and control. For both pathogens, calcium propionate and calcium chloride treatments resulted in significantly smaller lesion diameters compared to the control. The acervulus ratings indicate a lower formation in treated fruits, especially for calcium propionate and calcium chloride, suggesting that these treatments may inhibit fungal development effectively.
The data presented includes results from experiments assessing the incidence and severity of bitter rot on Nittany and Golden Delicious apple fruit. The experiments measured the effects of various treatments on the development of acervuli, with rankings assigned on a scale of 0 to 3: 0 = no acervuli initials, 1 = black acervuli initials visible, 2 = pigmented acervuli present but not viscid, and 3 = pigmented acervuli with a viscid appearance. Statistical differences among categorical rankings for acervulus developments were analyzed using the Kruskal-Wallis chi-squared test.
Table 3 summarizes the incidence (%) of bitter rot observed 7 and 9 days after inoculating calcium salt-treated wounds with different concentrations of conidia from Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. For C. gloeosporioides, treatments with 1,000, 10,000, and 100,000 conidia/ml of calcium propionate resulted in incidence rates of 53.3%, 93.3%, and 100% respectively. The calcium chloride treatment produced significantly lower incidences of 13.3% for 1,000 conidia/ml, yet the higher concentrations were consistently at 100%. Calcium silicate had an incidence of 53.3% at 1,000 conidia/ml but dropped to 66.7% at 100,000 conidia/ml. The control group also showed high incidence rates across all concentrations. The statistical analysis (indicated by letters) identifies significant differences among treatments at P = 0.05.
Table 4 presents the severity of bitter rot as measured by mean lesion diameter (in mm) on the same apple varieties, 7 and 9 days after inoculation. For C. gloeosporioides, calcium propionate yielded mean lesion diameters of 5.2 mm (1,000 conidia/ml), increasing to 6.8 mm (100,000 conidia/ml). Calcium chloride had much lower values, especially at 1.3 mm for the lowest concentration. The calcium silicate treatment produced mean diameters similar to the control, with the latter having the highest mean lesion diameter of 11.8 mm at 1,000 conidia/ml. The differences between treatments were also statistically significant, indicated by the assigned letters.
Values in both tables are averages from 30 measurements, with statistical differences highlighted according to the Waller-Duncan test at P = 0.05.
This table details the incidence of bitter rot on Golden Delicious apples following three weekly applications of different calcium solutions during June, July, or August. After treatment, the fruits were inoculated with conidia from either Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or C. acutatum. The incidence percentages were recorded over four weeks. The calcium propionate treatment showed 0% incidence at one week but rose to 77% by the fourth week. Calcium chloride had similar patterns, with lower initial incidences but higher rates by week four. Calcium silicate showed a significant increase in incidence, reaching 100% by week four. The control group had the highest incidences across all weeks, indicating that untreated fruit were most susceptible to the pathogens.
This table presents the incidence of bitter rot on Nittany apples subjected to three weekly applications of various calcium solutions, followed by inoculation with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or C. acutatum. Results were measured at multiple intervals post-harvest. Notably, calcium propionate showed a gradual increase in incidence from 1.1% at harvest to 17.8% by week four. The control group consistently exhibited higher incidences, peaking at 71.1% after four weeks. These results highlight the effectiveness of calcium treatments in managing the incidence of bitter rot in apples post-harvest.
This data illustrates the importance of disease management in fruit cultivation, particularly against a backdrop of various pathogens that threaten apple quality and yield.
In the present study, we observed direct inhibition of germ tube elongation and mycelial growth in in vitro assays. It is likely that these effects also occur in vivo in the presence of free calcium ions. The mechanisms by which calcium salts inhibit germ tube and mycelial growth are not fully understood. One hypothesis suggests that high external concentrations of Ca²⁺ may lead to increased concentrations of Ca²⁺ in the cytosol. Since maintaining low basal concentrations of internal Ca²⁺ is essential for normal cellular functions, organisms unable to regulate intracellular Ca²⁺ may experience compromised growth and development. Calcium ions may reduce the incidence of fungal infections by directly inhibiting fungal growth and by suppressing cell wall-degrading enzymes produced by pathogens.
In the mid-Atlantic region, apples are affected by speck (Zygophiala jamaicensis). The role of calcium supplementation in the integrated management of apple diseases is not well defined, as few organisms among the multitude of apple pathogens have been examined in detail. Most current knowledge pertains to the post-harvest pathogens mentioned earlier. In the pre-harvest environment, calcium chloride and other calcium salts have demonstrated suppressive activity against V. inaequalis, P. leucotricha, and G. juniperi-virginianae in research trials (A. R. Biggs, unpublished data). However, the early part of the growing season—when these fungi pose the greatest threat—is not when calcium applications are typically made for managing calcium-related deficiency disorders. Furthermore, calcium alone does not provide sufficient suppression of these diseases to prevent economic losses.
During the middle to late part of the growing season, when calcium chloride is usually applied for its effects on fruit quality, no reduction in the incidence of sooty blotch or flyspeck has been observed, although the severity of these issues is often reduced (A. R. Biggs, unpublished). Currently, there are no data on the effects of calcium salts on the incidence of white rot or black rot. Although further research is necessary, calcium salts may play a future role in disease management for fruit destined for processing, particularly in years when inoculum levels are low and environmental conditions are not highly favorable.
