Strawberry anthracnose is a significant disease in China, leading to considerable economic losses. Several species of Colletotrichum are recognized as pathogens of strawberry. A survey of strawberry fields across eight provinces in China was conducted to identify the causal agents of this disease. The disease primarily manifests as crown rot, causing plant wilting and death during the nursery stage and after transplanting in greenhouses, making anthracnose a major threat to strawberry production and quality.
Multi-locus sequence analysis combined with morphological assessment indicated that the disease-associated taxa belong to two Colletotrichum species complexes: Colletotrichum nymphaeae (acutatum species complex), C. fructicola, and C. changpingense sp. nov. (gloeosporioides species complex). This novel species is introduced in this paper and illustrated. It is closely related to C. theobromicola, and pathogenicity tests confirmed its ability to infect the strawberry crown, fruits, and leaves.
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world’s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 × 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People’s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.
Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.
Disease samples exhibiting anthracnose symptoms were collected from various locations (Anhui, Hainan, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong provinces, and Beijing and Shanghai cities) in China from 2011 to 2014. To promote fungal development and facilitate isolation, samples were incubated in a clean polythene bag with sterilized tissue dipped in distilled water. The samples were surface sterilized in 3.5% sodium hypochlorite for 1–2 minutes and then rinsed three times in sterilized water before culturing on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) medium at 28 °C. Single germinating conidia were transferred to fresh PDA medium and incubated at 28 °C to obtain pure fungal colonies (Chomnunti et al., 2014). The pure isolates were maintained on PDA medium with sterilized filter paper and incubated for 7–10 days at 28 °C. Cultures on the filter papers were dried and stored at -20 °C for further study. Fungal mycelia and spores were observed and photographed using a ZEISS Imager M1 microscope, with measurements made on 40 conidia. All microscopic measurements were conducted with Axio Vision v4.8, and images used for figures were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended version 10.0 (Adobe Systems, United States). Facesoffungi and Index Fungorum numbers are provided (Jayasiri et al., 2015; Index Fungorum, 2016).
Consensus sequences from the sequences generated using forward and reverse primers were obtained using DNAStar v.5.1 and SeqMan v.5.00 (Burland, 2000). A combined dataset of the five gene regions was prepared using Clustal X v.1.81 (Thompson et al., 1997). Further alignment of sequences was achieved using default settings in MAFFT v.7 (Katoh & Toh, 2008, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), and manual adjustments were made using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999) where necessary. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed: one for the acutatum species complex and another for the gloeosporioides species complex. Maximum Parsimony analysis (MP) was performed using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) to obtain the most parsimonious trees. Gaps were treated as missing data, and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions. A maximum of 5,000 trees were set up, branches of zero length were collapsed, and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics for parsimony—Tree Length (TL), Consistency Index (CI), Retention Index (RI), Rescaled Consistency Index (RC), and Homoplasy Index (HI)—were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. The robustness of the most parsimonious trees was evaluated by 1,000 bootstrap replications resulting from the maximum parsimony analysis (Hillis & Bull, 1993). Kishino-Hasegawa tests (KHT) (Kishino & Hasegawa, 1989) were performed to determine whether the trees were significantly different. Bayesian inference (BI) was also employed to construct the phylogenies using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Ronquist et al., 2003). MrModeltest v.2.3 (Nylander, 2004) was used to select the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution. The HYK+I model was selected for ITS, a HKY+G model for GAPDH and β-tubulin, a K80+I+G model for CHS-1, and a GTR+G model for ACT were incorporated into the analysis. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100th generation. The 2,000 trees representing the burn-in phase of the analyses were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree. The alignments and trees are deposited in TreeBASE (Sanderson et al., 1994) under accession number S20238.
The fungal strains used for the phylogenetic analysis in this study are listed in Table 1.
New species and their most closely related species were analyzed using the GCPSR model. A pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) (Philippe & Bryant, 2006) test was performed in SplitsTree4 (Huson, 1998; Huson & Bryant, 2006), as described by Quaedvlieg et al. (2014), to determine the recombination level within phylogenetically closely related species using a five-locus concatenated dataset for C. changpingense and its related species. If the pairwise homoplasy index is below a 0.05 threshold (Φw < 0.05), it indicates that significant recombination is present in the dataset. The relationships between closely related species were visualized by constructing a split graph, using both the LogDet transformation and splits decomposition options.
In order to test the pathogenicity of the new species, detached fruits and leaf inoculations were conducted. To determine whether this new species can infect the rhizome (crown), seedling inoculations were also carried out.
To assess the pathogenicity toward strawberry rhizomes, 30 strawberry seedlings were planted in plastic pots and inoculated with a spore suspension. Each seedling was placed in a separate pot, to which 100 mL of spore suspension was added. Control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized water. Both the inoculated seedlings and the controls were maintained in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a 12-hour day/night cycle. Colletotrichum species were isolated from strawberry fruits, petioles, rhizomes, and stolons exhibiting typical anthracnose symptoms. A total of 121 isolates were obtained from the diseased samples and are deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection (CGMCC), Mae Fah Luang University Culture Collection (MFLUCC) in Thailand, and the China Agricultural University in Beijing, China.
Twenty-one representative strains were used for phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenies were reconstructed using combined sequence data from the ACT, GAPDH, CHS, ITS, and β-tubulin genes for our Colletotrichum isolates, along with data from recent publications (Damm et al. 2012, Weir et al. 2012, Sharma et al. 2013, Yan et al. 2015, Diao et al. 2017). A single phylogenetic tree was constructed for all Colletotrichum strains, incorporating our sequence data with five combined gene alignments. This tree was compared with the backbone tree from Hyde et al. (2014), narrowing the species down to the acutatum and gloeosporioides species complexes. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed for these complexes. Maximum-parsimony and Bayesian inference produced nearly identical topologies (Bayesian trees are not shown).
The combined gene alignment for the acutatum complex included 37 taxa and 1712 characters, accounting for gaps, with C. orchidophilum (CBS 632.80) as the outgroup taxon. Parsimony analysis revealed that 1249 characters were constant, 229 were variable but uninformative, and 234 were parsimony-informative. The parsimony analysis of the data matrix yielded a single most parsimonious tree (TL = 689, CI = 0.729, RI = 0.820, RC = 0.597, HI = 0.271), which is illustrated in Figure 2. Five isolates (SA0017, SA0024, SA0041, SA0069, and SA0070) clustered together with C. nymphaeae with strong support.
Figure 1 depicts the symptoms of strawberry anthracnose, showing various stages of infection: (a) wilted seedling plants at the early disease stage in a greenhouse, (b) wilted and dead plants in the field, (c) dead plants with crown rot symptoms, and (d) reddish-brown tissue of a strawberry crown infected by Colletotrichum sp.
The combined gene alignment for the gloeosporioides complex comprised 52 taxa and 1932 characters, including gaps, with C. boninense (CBS 123755) as the outgroup taxon. Parsimony analysis indicated that 1350 characters were constant, 318 were variable but uninformative, and 264 were parsimony-informative. This analysis produced 100 most parsimonious trees; one of these (TL = 1040, CI = 0.696, RI = 0.779, RC = 0.542, HI = 0.304) is shown in Figure 3. In this tree, 15 isolates from this study clustered together with C. fructicola (CBS 130416) with high support, while isolates SA0016 and SA0050 were positioned as sister to a clade containing C. grevilleae, C. grossum, and C. theobromicola, also with high support (100/1.00).
All inoculated leaves and fruits exhibited symptoms after 72 hours of inoculation. Symptoms on the wounded leaves and fruits appeared 24 hours earlier than those on non-wounded tissues. Under high humidity conditions, orange spore masses developed on the lesions.

Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde was originally reported from coffee berries in Thailand (Prihastuti et al. 2009) and is known for its wide host range (Weir et al. 2012). This species belongs to the gloeosporioides species complex and has been reported from Canada and the USA, causing strawberry anthracnose (Weir et al. 2012). In this study, 15 strains were isolated from strawberries: one from a fruit, two from petioles, 11 from rhizomes, and one from a stolon. The phylogram shows that our strains clustered with C. fructicola (ICMP 18581) with 99% bootstrap support and posterior probability values of 1.00 (Figure 3).
Colletotrichum nymphaeae (Pass.) Aa. has a wide host range and is part of the acutatum species complex. It has been recorded from several countries, including Bulgaria, Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Kenya, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA, where it causes strawberry anthracnose (Damm et al. 2012). Five strains of this species were isolated from strawberries: two from fruits, two from petioles, and one from a stolon. Our strains clustered with C. nymphaeae (CBS515.78) with 100% bootstrap support and posterior probability values of 1.00 (Figure 2).
Colletotrichum changpingense G. Zhang, Jayawardena & K.D. Hyde, sp. nov. (Index Fungorum No: IF552575; Facesoffungi number: FoF: 00644). Etymology: This species is named after the locality where it was discovered. Holotype: MFLU 15-0212, a pathogen on strawberry rhizome. Colonies grown from single conidia on PDA are white, with a black center and pale yellow-grey towards the edge, reaching a maximum diameter of 78 mm in 7 days at 28 ºC, with a growth rate of 2–7.8 mm/day. Aerial mycelium is white, dense, and cottony. Vegetative hyphae are 1–2.1 mm, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. The asexual morph developed on PDA, with conidiomata measuring 208–425 mm in diameter, abundant, black, acervulus-shaped, oval, and solitary to aggregated, featuring orange spore masses. Setae are absent. Conidiophores are 26 mm long, hyaline to light brown, cylindrical or clavate, smooth-walled, simple, and wide at the base, occurring in densely arranged clusters. Conidiogenous cells measure 7–26 × 1.5–3 (mean = 18.5 × 1.9, n = 10), enteroblastic, hyaline, and smooth-walled.

Notes – Based on multi-locus sequence data (ACT, CHS, GAPDH, ITS, and β-tubulin), C. changpingense is phylogenetically closely related to C. grevilleae, C. grossum, and C. theobromicola. Sequence data derived from the ITS region does not differentiate C. changpingense from C. grevilleae, C. theobromicola, and C. grossum. A BLASTn search with the ITS sequence of this strain showed 100% similarity to JX573319, a C. gloeosporioides isolate. The closest match in a BLASTn search in GenBank with the GAPDH sequence was JX009957, a C. theobromicola strain, with 99% similarity. The closest matches in a BLASTn search with the CHS sequence was KF772060, a C. siamense strain with 97% similarity, and with the ACT sequence was KT936435, a C. siamense strain with 99% similarity. The BLASTn search with the β-tubulin sequence is identical to C. grossum (CAUG7, KP890171) and C. theobromicola (C1273, JX010382).
Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. grevilleae by 17 bp changes in ACT, 11 bp changes in CHS, 6 bp changes in GAPDH, and 8 bp changes in ITS. It differs from the type strain of C. theobromicola by 17 bp changes in ACT, 12 bp changes in CHS, 2 bp changes in GAPDH, 9 bp changes in ITS, and 8 bp changes in β-tubulin. Additionally, C. changpingense differs from the type strain of C. grossum by 18 bp changes in ACT, 9 bp changes in CHS, and 5 bp changes in GAPDH. Therefore, C. changpingense provides sufficient data to be classified as a new species. A PHI test revealed no significant recombination events between C. changpingense and its closely related taxa (Figure 6).
Figure 6 – The results of the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test of closely related species using both LogDet transformation and splits decomposition. PHI test results (Φw) < 0.05 indicate significant recombination within the dataset. Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single-gene identifications, which often led to identification at the species complex level rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton 1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae), became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010). This challenge prompted the use of molecular methods (Cai et al. 2009), which provide valuable data for clarifying the systematics of Colletotrichum (Hyde et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015). Xie et al. (2010) identified the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of strawberry cultivar Toyonoka in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China, to be C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. theobromicola using morphology and the ITS gene region alone. As the ITS gene alone does not effectively resolve Colletotrichum species (Martinez-Culebras 2002, Jelev et al. 2008, Xie et al. 2010), multigene analysis has been adopted to satisfactorily resolve Colletotrichum species (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014), and the present study has followed this protocol.
