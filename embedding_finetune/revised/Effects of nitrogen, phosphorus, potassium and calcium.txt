The effects of varying concentrations of four nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium—in fertilizer solutions on the severity of anthracnose in strawberry cv. Nyoho, cultivated under a non-circulation hydroponics system, were assessed after inoculation with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Additionally, the crop growth and tissue contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in the entire above-ground parts of the plant were investigated. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity, in contrast to phosphorus and calcium. Treatments using either ammonium (NH₄) or nitrate (NO₃) nitrogen showed no significant difference. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (R² = 0.9078) and phosphorus (R² = 0.8842), but was not influenced by higher levels of potassium (R² = 0.8587) and calcium (R² = 0.6526).
In Korea, strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) are favored for winter cultivation when the production of other vegetables and fruits is relatively low. In 2003, strawberries were planted on a total area of 7,503 hectares in Korea, with plastic greenhouse cultivation comprising 7,172 hectares and a total production of 205,427 tonnes for the fresh market (Anonymous, 2004). Forcing, where strawberries are transplanted into greenhouses in mid-September and induced to fruit in December (Oda, 1991), is becoming more common in Korea. June-bearing cultivars such as Maehyang, Akihime, and Nyoho, used for forcing, have proven difficult to grow due to their susceptibility to anthracnose (Nam et al., 1998; Kim & Nam, 1999). Anthracnose is one of the most damaging diseases of strawberries, causing wilting and death of transplants in the nursery field. The pathogen responsible for the disease in Korea is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, first reported in 1992 (Kim et al., 1992).
The nutritional status of a plant significantly impacts its susceptibility to disease, a principle that has been utilized to reduce disease severity (Huber & Watson, 1974; Engelhard, 1989; Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993). Little is currently known about the influence of plant nutrition on strawberry anthracnose. This study aims to investigate the effects of the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium on the development of strawberry anthracnose, with the goal of developing practical disease management strategies.
Tissue-cultured seedlings of strawberry cv. Nyoho at the...
Transplants were grown in pots containing perlite and irrigated with distilled water for a month to leach out nutrients from the perlite. This process also reduced the tissue nutrient content of the strawberry plants. After this period, plant tissue was sampled from the shoots to analyze the effects of various nutrient treatments. Tissue samples were washed with 0.2 N HCl for 1 minute, rinsed with distilled water, dried for 2 days at 70 °C, and ground in a Wiley mill to pass through a 1 mm particle size sieve. Total nitrogen (N) was determined using a modified Kjeldahl procedure, which included a salicylic acid pretreatment to assist in reducing nitrate (NO3) levels (Eastin, 1978). Tissue used for phosphorus (P), potassium (K), and calcium (Ca) analysis was dry-ashed at 500 °C, treated with HCl, and finally dissolved in 0.5 N HCl. K and Ca were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrometry, while colorimetric analysis was used for P (Chapman & Pratt, 1961).
The growth characteristics of the plants were assessed after 1 month of nutrient solution treatments. An inoculum of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (CGF43) was prepared at a concentration of 10. The following micronutrients were applied to all pots: manganese chloride (MnCl₂·4H₂O) at 1.8 g L⁻¹, boric acid (H₃BO₃) at 2.86 g L⁻¹, zinc sulfate (ZnSO₄·7H₂O) at 0.22 g L⁻¹, copper sulfate (CuSO₄·5H₂O) at 0.08 g L⁻¹, molybdenum trioxide (H₁MoO₄·H₂O) at 0.09 g L⁻¹, and sodium iron EDTA (NaFeEDTA) at 0.79 g L⁻¹.
Data from nutrient concentrations and trials with different nitrogen sources were subjected to analysis of variance. Treatment means were compared using Duncan's multiple range test at P = 0.05. The relationships between nutrient concentrations and dry weight, as well as between nutrient concentrations and disease index, were evaluated using regression analysis (Duffy & Dufago, 1999; Choi et al., 2000). All data analyses were performed using the SAS program (SAS Institute, Inc., USA). The strawberry plants were watered with the nutrient treatment solution every 2 days for a total of 50 days.
Hoagland nutrient solution (Hoagland & Arnon, 1950) was modified to create treatment solutions containing varying levels of nitrogen (0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mM), phosphorus (0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 3 mM), potassium (0, 10, 20, and 30 mM), and calcium (0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6 mM). The pH of all treatment solutions was adjusted to 6.5 using 1 N HCl or KOH. The effect of nitrogen form was tested by comparing nitrate and ammonium compounds at 5, 10, and 15 mM.
Anthracnose symptoms first appeared in the nitrogen treatment approximately 2 weeks after inoculation. A strong positive correlation (adjusted R² = 0.96) was observed between nitrogen concentration in the treatment solution and the severity of anthracnose disease, with disease severity peaking (DI ∼3) at a nitrogen concentration of 30 mM. The disease tended to be more severe in treatments receiving ammonium (NH₄) compared to nitrate (NO₃), although these differences were not statistically significant.
The experimental design was a completely randomized plot with five replications. Pots were arranged 25 cm apart in rows. The experiment took place in a glasshouse with nighttime temperatures ranging from 17–18 °C and daytime temperatures between 24–28 °C, while relative humidity levels varied.
The experimental period involved light intensities ranging from 40% to 80%, with daylight intensity fluctuating between 550 and 1200 µmol m−2 s−1. The inoculated plants were treated with a solution containing 2 mL−1 of the inoculum and subsequently placed in a dew chamber set at 30 °C and 100% relative humidity (RH) for 2 days. Following this incubation, they were moved to a glasshouse maintained at temperatures between 24 and 28 °C (Gupton & Smith, 1991). After 17 days, the disease severity on each plant was assessed and rated on a disease index (DI) scale of 0 to 4, defined as follows: 0 for healthy plants; 1 for less than 50% of petioles affected; 2 for 50% or more petioles affected; 3 for wilted plants; and 4 for complete necrosis.
Figure 1 illustrates the development of anthracnose (shown as a scatter plot with error bars) and nutrient concentration (represented by vertical bars) in strawberry plants treated with varying concentrations of nitrogen (a), phosphorus (b), potassium (c), and calcium (d). The disease index categories correspond to the previously defined scale. The adjusted regression coefficients and line derivations for nitrogen and potassium (plots a and c) were statistically significant (P ≤ 0.05), while differences for phosphorus and calcium (plots b and d) were not significant (P ≥ 0.62). The error bars indicate ± standard error of the mean.
Additionally, prior studies have indicated correlations between nitrogen concentration and anthracnose severity, similar to findings in cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Choi et al. (2000) noted that as tissue nitrogen content decreased, calcium and manganese contents, which directly impact phenolic metabolism, increased in strawberries. Manganese may enhance the synthesis of host defense products, potentially reducing disease incidence and severity. Phosphorus supplied as phosphite effectively reduced phytophthora root and crown rot in tomato and pepper plants, while calcium has been shown to inhibit anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Froster et al., 1998).
Table 2 presents the analysis of regression relating the concentration of individual nutrients (nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium) to the dry weight of strawberry plants. The regression equations and coefficients for each nutrient are provided, indicating varying levels of significance.

Plant Disease 82, 1165–1170. Strawberry prefers NH₄ to NO₃ nitrogen for optimal growth (Park, 1990). Other studies have shown that the use of ammonium increases the severity of cotton anthracnose (Bollenbacher & Fulton, 1971) and Fusarium crown rot (Woltz et al., 1992) more than the use of nitrate. It was found that, on average, strawberry plants receiving ammonium nitrogen had more disease than those receiving nitrate treatments, although these differences were not significant.
Increasing nitrogen and potassium in nutrient solutions resulted in higher percentages of both elements in strawberry but also increased the severity of anthracnose. To decrease anthracnose in strawberries, it is suggested that a minimum of nitrogen and potassium should be present in any fertilizer used, not exceeding 15 and 10 units of nitrogen and potassium, respectively.
