Conidial suspensions of Colletotrichum acutatum were prepared in 1:27, 1:45, and 1:81 (wt/vol) dilutions of an extract of strawberry (cv. Tristar) flowers or leaves in water. Strawberry leaves and plastic coverslips were sprayed with the conidial suspensions, incubated at 25°C with continuous wetness for 48 hours, and the number of conidia and appressoria were counted. In another experiment, leaves and coverslips were sprayed with a conidial suspension in water, incubated for 72 hours to establish C. acutatum populations, and then placed in a growth chamber under dry conditions for up to 6 weeks. At each sampling time, leaves and coverslips were sprayed with flower extracts, leaf extracts, or water.
The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.
The epiphytic behavior of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may play a critical role in the strawberry anthracnose disease cycle. Recent studies have shown that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on strawberry leaves without visible symptom development and can persist on symptomless foliage of strawberries and weeds for several weeks. As a result, symptomless leaves may act as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose. Similarly, symptomless foliage of tomato and citrus has been reported to provide inoculum for diseases caused by C. coccodes and C. acutatum, respectively.
The behavior of Colletotrichum species on plant surfaces can be influenced by various factors, including the presence of host exudates. On citrus, flower extracts have been found to play a significant role in post-bloom fruit drop caused by C. acutatum.
Additional Keywords: Phyllosphere ecology, secondary conidiation, strawberry anthracnose.
Soluble flower extracts stimulate appressoria on the leaf surface to germinate and produce secondary conidia without developing typical lesions or fruiting structures. These conidia then serve as initial inoculum for citrus flower infections. The potential for Colletotrichum acutatum to produce secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves has been characterized under various temperatures and intermittent wetness regimes. However, it remains unclear whether flower extracts can stimulate inoculum production by C. acutatum on strawberry foliage. A better understanding of C. acutatum behavior in the presence of plant extracts may illuminate the role of symptomless foliage as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose.
The objective of this study was to determine the effects of strawberry plant extracts on conidial germination, appressorial development, and secondary conidiation of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves. A preliminary report has been published.
Plant Production and Maintenance: Day-neutral strawberry crowns (cv. Tristar) were planted in 15-cm-diameter plastic pots containing a 1:2:1 mixture of peat, perlite, and soil, and grown in a greenhouse maintained at 25 ± 10°C with a 16-hour photoperiod. The plants were drip irrigated and fertilized with a 21-5-20 fertilizer solution (400 ppm of N; Miracle Gro Excel; The Scotts Company, Marysville, OH) as needed. Fully opened strawberry flowers were collected the week prior to extract preparation and stored in the refrigerator until use. Healthy, mature strawberry leaves were collected on the same day for extract preparation. Strawberry plants grown under the same conditions were used for inoculations in all experiments.
Inoculum Production: Cultures of C. acutatum isolate HF-ac-98, obtained from strawberry fruit in Iowa, were initiated by depositing infested silica gel crystals on potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates and culturing at 25°C in the dark for 5 to 7 days. Inoculum was then increased by spreading conidia collected from the PDA cultures onto strawberry fruit agar (SFA) and incubating for 7 days at 25°C in the dark.
Extract Preparation: Concentrated flower extract (1:9, wt/vol) was prepared by grinding 7 g of petals, pistils, and stamens (discarding sepals and peduncles) in 63 ml of sterile deionized water (SDW) using a mortar and pestle. The resulting flower pulp was filtered through four layers of sterile cheesecloth into a flask, and the filtrate was centrifuged at 10,000 rpm (12,100 × g) for 5 minutes. The supernatant was vacuum filtered through Whatman No. 1 filter paper to remove larger particles, then filter-sterilized through a 0.45-µm-diameter Millipore membrane. Concentrated leaf extract (1:9, wt/vol) was prepared by macerating 16 g of leaves (without petioles) in 144 ml of SDW for 1 minute in a blender. The leaf pulp was processed similarly to the flower extract.
After exposure to each dry period (0, 1, 2, 4, and 6 weeks), two plants and two petri dishes per treatment were removed from the growth chamber, sprayed with either plant extract or water, and immediately placed in a dew chamber at 25°C and 100% relative humidity (RH) for 48 hours. The leaves and coverslips were allowed to dry and then prepared for microscopic observation as previously described. For each dry period treatment, the two plants and petri dishes assigned for a pretreatment assessment of Colletotrichum acutatum populations were removed from the growth chamber and immediately prepared for microscopic observation without the application of water or plant extracts or any further incubation. Conidial and appressorial populations were quantified as described above, and the experiment was repeated once.
The experimental design used to determine the effects of plant extracts on conidial germination was a randomized complete block design (RCBD) with two replications, and the experiment was repeated twice (three runs total). However, due to experimental mishaps, only four replications (one from the first two runs of the experiment and two from the third run) yielded usable data. Given the lack of experiment-treatment interactions, data from these four replications were combined and analyzed according to the RCBD. Data on the effects of extracts on established C. acutatum populations were analyzed separately for each run of the experiment due to significant experiment-treatment interactions for some measurements. Data were analyzed separately for each sampling time according to an RCBD with two replications. Data for pretreatment C. acutatum populations at each time were not included in this analysis. In both experiments, data were analyzed using the Generalized Linear Model (GLM) procedure of SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), and treatment effects were compared using Fisher’s least significant difference test (LSD). Statistical significance was expressed at the P = 0.05 threshold level.
Strawberry flower and leaf extracts significantly affected the conidial populations of C. acutatum when the conidia were applied with the extracts to leaves and coverslips. The number of conidia applied at inoculation (0 hours) did not differ significantly among treatments on each substrate. After 24 hours, there were significantly more conidia on leaves in all flower extract treatments compared to the water control, and conidial numbers were significantly higher in the most concentrated flower extract than in the other dilutions. The number of conidia increased tenfold within 24 hours after inoculation in the most concentrated flower extract, and six- to sevenfold in the more dilute flower extracts. Conidial numbers on leaves were significantly higher in the presence of leaf extracts than in water for the two most concentrated dilutions, but did not differ significantly among the three dilutions. Conidia increased approximately sevenfold in the most concentrated leaf extract dilution and fourfold in the intermediate dilution within 24 hours after inoculation.
The number of germinated conidia on leaves did not differ among treatments, ranging from 9 to 15 conidia per mm². As with total conidia, the number of ungerminated conidia was significantly higher in the flower extract treatments than in water, increasing significantly with extract concentration. There were no significant treatment effects on the number of appressoria formed by C. acutatum on leaves. Treatment differences observed on leaves 48 hours after inoculation were similar to those at 24 hours.
The application of flower extracts to populations of Colletotrichum acutatum exposed to different durations of dry conditions significantly affected the total number of conidia on leaves and coverslips. There were significantly more conidia on leaves treated with the most concentrated flower extract than in any other treatment after exposure to 0 and 2 weeks of dryness in run 1 of the experiment and after exposure to 1 week of dryness in run 2. Leaf extracts did not significantly affect the number of conidia on leaves compared to the water control, except after 2 weeks of dryness in run 1. On coverslips, both flower extract dilutions significantly increased conidial numbers compared to the water control after exposures of 0, 1, or 2 weeks of dryness in run 1 and after 0 and 2 weeks of dryness in run 2. The flower extract dilutions differed significantly in their capacity to stimulate secondary conidiation on coverslips after 0 weeks of dryness in both runs of the experiment. The application of the most concentrated leaf extract to coverslips also significantly increased the number of conidia compared to the water control after 0, 1, and 2 weeks of dryness in run 1 and after 0 and 2 weeks in run 2, but this effect was less pronounced than that of the flower extracts. Notably, the effects of flower extracts on conidial numbers became less pronounced with increasing exposure to dryness, particularly on leaves, where conidial populations tended to decrease over time across all treatments.
The number of appressoria formed on both leaves and coverslips did not differ significantly among treatments at each time point, except in run 2 on coverslips, where water application after 0 weeks of dryness resulted in more appressoria than the application of leaf extracts. Overall, the number of appressoria did not show a clear trend of increase or decrease over time.
This study has demonstrated that inoculum production by C. acutatum on symptomless leaves can be strongly stimulated by strawberry extracts.
Figure 1 illustrates Colletotrichum acutatum conidia and appressoria on strawberry leaves and coverslips that were inoculated with a suspension of 5 × 10^5 conidia/ml in water, flower extracts, or leaf extracts immediately after inoculation and after 24 hours of incubation under continuous wetness at 25°C. The treatments included different dilutions of flower and leaf extracts, indicated by the ratios of plant material to water. The data are presented as means from four replications, with bars labeled with the same letter indicating no significant differences at P = 0.05 according to Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test. The LSD values for treatment comparisons within each group are provided for conidia and appressoria at both time points on leaves and coverslips.
C. acutatum conidia typically germinate by forming germ tubes and appressoria. However, conidia can also germinate by forming conidial phialides, which are specialized conidiogenous structures that produce secondary conidia without extensive mycelial growth. We recently reported that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods, resulting in up to a threefold increase in conidial populations on the leaf surface. In this study, conidial populations increased by up to tenfold on strawberry leaves when germination occurred in the presence of strawberry flower extracts. This suggests that ungerminated conidia exposed to flower extracts have a greater capacity to produce secondary inoculum on strawberry leaves than conidia germinating in water. The cause of the observed stimulatory effect is not clear, but it may be associated with nutrients or other stimulatory substances in the extracts. The stimulatory effects of flower extracts on C. acutatum multiplication were even more pronounced on coverslips, where conidial populations increased by up to sixteenfold. Excess nutrients and microorganisms on the leaf surface may have attenuated the effects of the extracts on leaves compared to coverslips. Nutrient deficiency, for example, has been associated with the induction of secondary conidiation by fungi such as Helminthosporium sativum and C. gloeosporoides in response to the inhibition of hyphal development. A stronger effect of nutrients in vitro than on host surfaces was also noted by Parbery and Blakeman in germination studies with C. acutatum.
Figure Description: The figure illustrates the presence of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia on leaves and coverslips across two experimental runs. In both runs, leaves and coverslips were sprayed with a conidial suspension, incubated for 72 hours at 25°C under continuous wetness, and subsequently treated with water, flower extracts (F1:27 and F1:81), or leaf extracts (L1:27 and L1:81) after exposure to dryness for 0 to 6 weeks at 25°C. Following the treatment, the samples were incubated for an additional 48 hours under continuous wetness at 25°C. The dilutions of the flower and leaf extracts are expressed as weight-to-volume ratios of plant material to water. A continuous line in the figure represents the conidial populations prior to treatment application and incubation. Statistical analysis indicates that bars containing the same letter at each time point are not significantly different at P = 0.05 according to Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test, with 'NS' indicating no significant differences within the group. The data are presented as means for each experiment, and specific LSD values are provided for treatment comparisons at various sampling times.
It was reported that Colletotrichum acutatum appressoria surviving on citrus leaves can be induced to germinate and produce secondary conidia by flower extracts, although appressorial germination was not observed in our study. In previous work, we noted the production of secondary conidia by conidial and hyphal phialides shortly after germination. However, in this study, it was unclear whether secondary conidia were produced by phialides originating from the germination of either conidia or resting appressoria.
The ability of flower extracts to stimulate C. acutatum conidiation decreased with increasing durations of dry periods, possibly due to rising fungal mortality over time. In contrast, appressoria tended to persist on leaves and coverslips both before and after treatment applications, consistent with their role as survival structures. The fact that C. acutatum could be stimulated to multiply on coverslips and leaves even after two weeks of exposure to dry conditions clearly indicates the durability of C. acutatum propagules and demonstrates that survival does not depend on the presence of a host. C. acutatum survival on inert material has also been shown on the clothing of fern field workers, where conidia survived for over four weeks.
Although the stimulation of secondary conidiation by flower extracts was clearly demonstrated, the effects of leaf extracts were less distinct. Leaf extracts stimulated secondary conidiation when conidia were germinated in the extracts and when applied to C. acutatum populations established on coverslips. However, they only stimulated conidia production once when applied to populations already established on leaves. Furthermore, the increase in conidia caused by leaf extracts was not as pronounced as that caused by flower extracts. These results may be explained by differences in nutritional composition and the balance of inhibitory and stimulatory substances in the leaf and flower extracts. For instance, germination of C. graminicola was inhibited by substances present in sorghum leaf extracts. In our study, the inhibitory effects of substances in the leaf extracts may have been counterbalanced by stimulatory substances, resulting in secondary conidiation stimulation in some cases.
The findings of this study enhance the understanding of the epiphytic phase of Colletotrichum acutatum on strawberries. Our work not only corroborates earlier studies indicating the capacity of this fungus to persist as an epiphyte (7, 13, 14), but also suggests that inoculum production on foliage may be significantly increased in the presence of flower extracts. Under field conditions, water-soluble extracts may be deposited onto leaves by rain splashing from flowers or may be released from flower parts that fall onto leaves during and after flowering. Therefore, it is reasonable to assume that C. acutatum populations surviving on foliage may be stimulated to produce inoculum by flower extracts under natural conditions. We suggest that these new findings could be valuable in developing management strategies against strawberry anthracnose. For example, fungicide applications aimed at reducing inoculum levels on strawberry plants may prevent the multiplication of C. acutatum during flowering, thus reducing the inoculum available for fruit and flower infections and delaying or preventing subsequent disease development.
