Red oak, or Tuchi (Quercus crassipes), is an ornamental endemic species of Mexico. On November 9, 2016, powdery mildew was observed on the leaves of Tuchi in Santa Fe, Mexico City. Symptoms included deformed leaves, irregular necrotic lesions on both sides of the leaf, premature leaf drop, chasmothecia, and mycelium. A reference specimen (CMPH-ECO23S) was deposited in the herbarium of the Colegio de Postgraduados. The fungus produced light brown to dark reddish chasmothecia immersed in the mycelium. These chasmothecia were either grouped or dispersed, measuring 99-111 µm in diameter, composed of polygonal peridial cells measuring 12-18 µm, with simple, sinuous, poorly developed, short, or nearly absent mycelial appendages (4-4.5 µm wide) interlaced with the surrounding mycelium. The single ascus was hyaline, ellipsoid or ovoid to globose, sessile, measuring 80-91 µm by 55-68 µm to 134 µm by 85 µm. The ascospores were hyaline, ellipsoid to ovoid, measuring 25-32 µm by 18-22 µm. Conidiophores and conidia were not observed. Amplification of the ITS region was carried out using primers ITS4 and ITS5. The PCR product (459 bp) was sequenced and deposited in GenBank (accession No. MF170000). The obtained sequence showed 100% similarity to AF011289 from Q. agrifolia. Although no ex-type sequence of C. lanestris is available in GenBank, both the type and this sequence were obtained from Q. agrifolia in California, USA. Based on morphological and molecular characteristics, the fungus observed on Quercus crassipes was identified as Cystotheca lanestris (Braun and Cook, 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this fungus causing powdery mildew on red oak in Mexico.

In 2013, fruits and leaves of Litchi chinensis [No Mai Tsz (73-S-20)] exhibiting symptoms of pepper spot (Cooke and Coates, 2002) were collected from Yunlin County in Taiwan. Diseased leaf tissue was surface-sterilized with 70% ethanol and placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA). A single spore isolate (C-1001) with aerial white mycelium that turned gray at 25°C and a 12-hour photoperiod produced salmon conidial masses after 10 days. Conidia were hyaline, aseptate, cylindrical, measuring 14.3 µm (12.77-15.38) by 4.9 µm (3.95-5.56).
Dark lesions associated with pepper spot disease developed on leaves 48 hours after inoculation and became evident four weeks later. Colletotrichum siamense was reisolated from the inoculated leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing pepper spot disease in lychee in Taiwan.
