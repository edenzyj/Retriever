The ontogeny of the invasion process by Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae was studied on petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler using light and electron microscopy. The invasion of host tissue by each fungal species was similar; however, each invasion event occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum. Following cuticular penetration via an appressorium, subsequent steps of invasion involved hyphal growth within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. Both species of fungi are responsible for causing anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.), which are attributed to the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk) (8, 21–23, 26). All three species incite diseases that cannot be distinguished in the field by symptoms alone. Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown worldwide but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they cause little injury to the plants. C. fragariae is most often associated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, humid regions such as the southeastern United States. Its host range is limited to strawberries and a few weeds (22). Conversely, C. acutatum is the primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot, has a broader geographic and host range than C. fragariae (8, 10, 22), and is increasing in importance as a cause of petiole, stolon, crown, and root infections (7).
Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries. A detailed consideration of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the context of strawberry anthracnose are crucial for understanding these dynamics.

The absence of a significant plant resistance response ensures successful colonization of host tissue and subsequent necrotrophic activities. Bailey et al. (1) described two major invasion strategies: intracellular hemibiotrophic invasion and subcuticular intramural invasion. The early stages of invasion for both strategies include conidial adhesion to the host surface, germination of conidia, production of germ tubes, and penetration of the host cuticle via appressoria. Subcuticular intramural pathogens grow within the cuticle and the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells, killing host cells prior to entering them (necrotrophic phase). In contrast, intracellular hemibiotrophic pathogens invade living cells for a short time, maintaining them apparently for nutritional advantage, before converting to a necrotrophic phase.
The role of chitin as both a host defense elicitor and a target for plant chitinases is well documented (3, 18, 20). Several fungi are known to modify or mask chitin in structures involved in early penetration, presumably to avoid detection by the host or to mitigate the effects of host chitinases. A lectin probe, gold-labeled wheat germ agglutinin, was chosen to study the distribution of chitin in the walls of C. fragariae during the initial infection of the strawberry host. The purpose of this study was to document the invasion strategies of C. acutatum and C. fragariae in strawberry, with respect to the strategies previously described by Bailey et al. (1), and to examine the degree to which chitin was present in various fungal infective structures.
Propagation of Strawberry Plants: Strawberry plants (cv. Chandler) were planted in 10 × 10 cm plastic pots containing a 1:1 (vol/vol) mixture of Jiffy-Mix (JPA, West Chicago, IL) and pasteurized sand. They were grown for at least 6 weeks before inoculation in a greenhouse maintained at 30°C during the day and 18°C at night, with a 16-hour photoperiod. Older leaves, runners, and flowers were removed 1 to 7 days before inoculation, leaving three or four young leaves on each plant.
Inoculation of Plants: Isolates of C. acutatum Goff and C. fragariae CF-63 and CF-75 (26) were maintained on silica gel at USDA-ARS in Poplarville, MS. These isolates were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 14 to 21 days at 25°C under fluorescent light at 14/10 hours of light/dark intervals. Conidial suspensions used for inoculations were prepared by flooding each PDA culture plate with sterile deionized water and gently scraping the agar surface with a glass rod to remove conidia. The resulting conidial suspension was filtered through cheesecloth, yielding a final concentration of 1.5 × 10^6 conidia per ml, which was used to inoculate the strawberry plants. Attached petioles and stolons were inoculated by misting to the point of runoff or by spot inoculation.
Table 1 outlines the time from inoculation of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa cv. Chandler) with two Colletotrichum species (C. acutatum and C. fragariae) to the first observation of various infection events. The table lists visible lesion and girdling lesion appearances, showing that visible lesions appeared in 2 to 4 days, while girdling lesions appeared in 4 to 5 days. It also details the occurrence of additional symptoms such as cortical and epidermal cell collapse. Notably, the time to visible lesions varied depending on the specific isolate and the tissue type affected, with petioles and stolons showing symptoms earlier than other plant parts.
Plants were incubated in a sealed 10-gallon tank at 100% relative humidity for 24 hours. After this period, relative humidity was reduced by removing half of the plastic tank cover for the remainder of the incubation time. Plants inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum were maintained at 28°C, while those inoculated with Colletotrichum fragariae were incubated at 32°C. Following inoculation, petioles and stolons were examined microscopically at 8- to 10-hour intervals over a 96-hour period to document the morphology and timing of germ tube development, appressorial formation, epidermal penetration, subsequent tissue invasion, disease symptom development, and acervulus production.
Symptomatic tissue was fixed for 2 hours in a solution containing 0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), 2.0% formaldehyde, and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. The tissue was rinsed with distilled water and postfixed for 45 minutes in cacodylate buffered (pH 7.0) 1% osmium tetroxide. It was then dehydrated using an ethanol series (50%, 70%, 85%, 95%, and 100%), followed by propylene oxide. The tissue was infiltrated with a 50/50 mixture of ERL 4206 resin (Spurr’s) and propylene oxide for 4 hours on a rotator, followed by an overnight change to a 75/25 resin/propylene oxide mixture. Two changes of 100% resin were made over an 8-hour period, and the samples were cured at 70°C for 24 to 36 hours. The ERL 4206 resin contained nonenyl succinic anhydride (26 g), vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (10 g), diglycidyl ether (6 g), and dimethylaminoethanol (0.2 g).
Semithin sections (1 µm) were placed on a hot plate at 55°C, stained for 1 to 2 minutes with 0.1% aqueous toluidine blue-O, and examined under a light microscope. Ultrathin sections (100 nm) were prepared using a Porter-Blum MT-2B microtome and a diamond knife, collected on 200-mesh copper grids, and stained with lead citrate and 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. These sections were viewed using a Zeiss EM 10-C transmission electron microscope.
A procedure was developed to aid in locating appressoria on fixed, embedded material. Slivers of epidermal tissue, where appressoria had been observed using a compound microscope, were flat embedded in 2 to 3 mm of resin and cured at 70°C for 20 to 24 hours. Appressoria on the host tissue were identified through the thin plastic with a compound microscope, and hand sections containing appressoria were obtained. These hand sections were then remounted with Duco cement on prefaced stubs created by curing Spurr’s plastic in polyethylene Beem.
Figure 2 illustrates light micrographs taken 72 hours after inoculation with Colletotrichum species. Part A shows a petiole inoculated with C. acutatum, displaying an advanced stage of invasion with disrupted cortex and a mature acervulus, while vascular tissues (phloem and xylem) remain intact. Parts B, C, and D focus on a stolon inoculated with C. fragariae, showcasing hyphae invading parenchyma cells and vessel members, the expansion of the host cuticle as the acervulus enlarges, and the mature acervulus and stroma occupying the epidermal and subepidermal layers with massive destruction of the cortex.
Figure 3 features an electron micrograph of a germinated conidium of C. fragariae, highlighting gold probe labeling chitin on the inner wall and the septum, while the probe is absent from the outer wall and the matrix.
Capsules of size “00” were trimmed to a 1 × 1 mm face for ultrathin sectioning.
The application of the wheat germ agglutinin (WGA) probe (L-9640, Sigma, St. Louis) was modified from Benhamou (2). The ultrathin sections on 200-mesh nickel grids were floated on a drop of 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS), prepared by mixing 40 ml of 0.02 M potassium hydroxide, 50 ml of 0.02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 10 ml of distilled water, pH 7.4, in a moist chamber for 1 hour. Grids were subsequently incubated in a moist chamber for 2 hours in 15 µl of lectin-gold complex at the manufacturer's concentration of 1.4 × 10^13 particles per ml. The probe consisted of lectin from Triticum vulgaris conjugated to 10 nm colloidal gold particles. Each grid was then washed by dipping repeatedly and gently for 10 seconds into PBS. Grids were air-dried and subsequently stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate as described above.
Four-day-old cultures of C. fragariae grown on PDA, as described earlier, were overlaid with a thin layer of 2% agar to hold the mycelium together. Pieces of the culture were cut into 3 × 3 mm plugs, fixed, and processed for ultrathin sectioning, then probed with gold-labeled lectin as previously described.
The specificity of the WGA lectin binding was determined using the following tests based on Benhamou (2). These controls were run simultaneously with the normal probe application on symptomatic tissue: (1) The gold-labeled lectin was first pre-adsorbed with poly-(1-4)-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine purified from crab shells (C-9752, Sigma, St. Louis) at a concentration of 1 mg per 2 ml of probe for 1 hour, then applied as described above to sections containing fungi from a strawberry petiole lesion of 1 mm or larger. (2) The ultrathin sections were floated on a drop of PBS for 1 hour and probed with wheat germ agglutinin without a gold label for 1 hour. The remainder of the probe application followed the previously described method.
The ontogeny of the infection processes of C. acutatum and C. fragariae on inoculated plants were similar (as detailed in Table 1) at the light or electron microscopic levels. Lesions most commonly developed on stolon tips and the upper portion of the youngest petiole with fully expanded leaflets. Lesions were first observed 2 days after inoculation as lenticular brown spots that progressed into dark, sunken, and leathery lesions typical of anthracnose, which eventually girdled the stolon or petiole.
Figure 5 presents electron micrographs of strawberry tissue inoculated with Colletotrichum spp. Panels A and B illustrate the early stages of invasion of the petiole 116 hours after inoculation with C. acutatum. Panels C and D show fungal cells of C. fragariae penetrating living host cells of the stolon. Specifically, panel A depicts a fungal cell under the host cuticle, while panel B shows a fungal cell within the anticlinal host wall. Panel C captures the state of the tissue 116 hours post-inoculation, and panel D reflects the situation 48 hours after inoculation. Key components labeled in the micrographs include: c (cuticle), f (fungal cell), h (hypha), hw (host wall), and m (matrix). The scale bar represents 2 µm.
Fungal structures frequently developed over anticlinal host walls but were occasionally found on periclinal walls or near stomata. Appressoria and their basal pores were observed on the surface of both healthy and diseased plant tissue.
The first signs of host cell distress appeared when the cell wall contour became distorted and the plasmalemma pulled away from the cell wall (Fig. 1B to D). Hyphae during the early stages of lesion formation were less abundant in epidermal and subepidermal cells than in cortical cells. A gradual increase in fungal hyphae within the host cuticle, epidermis, and subepidermis was noted, with hyphae initially restricted to the apoplast and later invading dead cells (Fig. 1B to D). As the infection progressed, cell walls became increasingly distorted (Fig. 1D). In contrast to disrupted cortical cell walls, epidermal and subepidermal walls remained intact, even though hyphae penetrated their walls (Fig. 2A). Invasion of vascular tissue and acervulus formation occurred concurrently (Fig. 2A and B). The fungus was observed in vessel elements (Fig. 2B) during this final phase of the invasion process.
Acervulus formation began with the development of a stroma within the cuticle of epidermal cells. The cuticle expanded considerably to accommodate the growing acervulus (Fig. 2C). The maturing acervulus eventually broke through the cuticle and produced conidia (Fig. 2D). The acervulus expanded radially, with the stroma extending from the epidermis to the subepidermis. Acervuli were produced over a disrupted cortex or, in extreme cases, over a completely disintegrated cortex (Fig. 2D). In both scenarios, the epidermal and some subepidermal tissues remained intact.
The invasion of host tissue by C. fragariae and C. acutatum was similar; however, each invasion event occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum (Table 1). Lesions became visible on petioles 3 days after inoculation with C. fragariae, but were not observed until 4 days after inoculation with C. acutatum. A similar delay in invasion events was noted between petiole and stolon tissues following inoculation of either species, with most events occurring a day sooner on the stolons than on the petioles within the same species.
In the electron microscopy analysis, the conidial and germ tube walls consisted of two layers, with the outer layer being thinner and more electron-dense than the inner layer. Only the inner conidial layer was labeled by the WGA probe (Fig. 3). Upon germination, a septum formed bisecting the conidium (Fig. 3), and another developed between the conidium and the germ tube. The WGA probe was observed on the inner wall layers of the germ tube and its septa. A few vesicles were present in the germ tube after maturation of the appressorium, although no distinct organelles were observed. The probe was not detected in the cytoplasm of germ tubes or appressoria.
Some hyphae invaded the cuticle (Fig. 5A), the outer epidermal wall, and the anticlinal walls of the epidermis (Fig. 5B). Some hyphae initially penetrated what appeared to be living host cells (Fig. 5C and D). The host plasmalemma invaginated to accommodate hyphal penetration. The interface between the host membrane and the hyphal wall was frequently associated with a specific arrangement of electron-dense material (Fig. 5C and D). Various degrees of disturbance and relaxation of the microfibrillar components of cell walls were observed during the penetration of host cells, including early penetration events (Fig. 5A). The death of fungal cells was a rare occurrence.
Several dying host cells exhibited an amorphous, osmiophilic material around the inside portion of the tonoplast (Fig. 6A, C, and D), while others did not (Fig. 6B). Some cortical fungal hyphae appeared to be growing back toward the epidermis in the stage prior to acervulus formation (Fig. 6C). Acervulus formation involved the development of a subcuticular stroma within and beneath the outer host epidermal cell walls (Fig. 6D). A gradual vacuolation developed in stromatic cells (Fig. 6D). The stroma continued to develop into the epidermal and adjacent subepidermal cells, ultimately rupturing the cuticle (Fig. 7). Late development of the acervulus included the extension of the host cuticle to accommodate the expanding stroma, the rupture of the cuticle, and the early development of conidia (Fig. 7). Both Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum fragariae displayed a pulvinate type of acervulus.
Controls: There were no apparent variations in the labeling of the walls of fungi grown on PDA when compared to both young and older hyphae from lesions in planta. The WGA probe was evenly distributed on the unilayered walls. Septa were labeled with the same intensity as the outer walls. Labeling was diminished as expected when the probe was pre-adsorbed with chitin (control 1). Labeling was also diminished when the sections were incubated with lectin before applying the lectin-gold complex (control 2).
C. acutatum and C. fragariae underwent a very brief biotrophic phase (less than 12 hours) before entering their extended necrotrophic phase. Representatives of both species of fungi were observed entering living host cells and developing a matrix comparable to that described in reported biotrophic systems, but they killed the host cells within a few hours. Previous descriptions for other Colletotrichum species cited biotrophy as occurring at a minimum of "less than 24 hours." However, a scenario where a living cell is entered and quickly killed might be considered a modification of necrotrophy, rather than biotrophy or hemibiotrophy.
Penetration pegs were observed in our studies at the light microscope level but not at the ultrastructural level. The appressoria of C. fragariae observed at the ultrastructural level may have been in the process of forming a penetration peg or may have been arrested just prior to the formation of a penetration peg. Latent or quiescent stages have been observed in fungal infections of fruits, where the mature appressorium often does not produce a peg until the fruit reaches a particular stage of ripeness. This concept has not been sufficiently studied in strawberries for the fungal penetration of stolons, petioles, leaves, or roots. Strawberry petioles are often more resistant to infection by C. fragariae while the plant is fruiting. The development of appressoria in some species ceases with the onset of unfavorable conditions, remains latent, and resumes when conditions become favorable again. The more rapid invasion of host tissue by C. fragariae compared to C. acutatum aligns with previous reports indicating that C. fragariae is more aggressive than C. acutatum in inciting disease symptoms following inoculation.
The distribution of chitin visualized by the WGA gold probe in C. lindemuthianum has been reported by O’Connell and Ride. We found several similarities and some differences between their findings and our results using the same probe to study C. fragariae. The outer appressorial wall layer of C. lindemuthianum was labeled more heavily by the probe than the inner layer. In contrast, the outer appressorial wall layer of C. fragariae was labeled less heavily than the inner layer. The matrices of both C. lindemuthianum and C. fragariae were unlabeled. The young intracellular hyphae of C. lindemuthianum were unlabeled, but the invasive hyphal walls of C. fragariae and the walls of the comparable secondary hyphae of C. lindemuthianum were labeled. The actively growing hyphal tips of either species labeled with less intensity than the mature walls. The outer wall layers of preinvasive structures of C. fragariae did not show the chitin-gold complex, but the single wall layers of invasive hyphae from the earliest stages observed in planta contained a chitin distribution comparable to that of young hyphae observed in vitro. C. fragariae did not appear to modify its chitin distribution during its very brief biotrophic phase, unlike C. lindemuthianum. This supports O’Connell and Ride’s suggestion that chitin masking is necessary during initial contact to establish a biotrophic relationship.
