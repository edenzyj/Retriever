INTRODUCTION: A Special Interest Group meeting titled Colletotrichum: Species, Ecology, and Interactions was held on 1 August 2010 at the 9th International Mycological Congress (IMC9) in Edinburgh, UK. Organized by Paul Cannon (UK) and Ulrike Damm (The Netherlands), the meeting gathered 23 scientists from 12 countries, all with a common interest in the genus Colletotrichum. Seven presentations covering a wide range of topics included systematics, population genetics, host-pathogen interactions, and genome projects. This contribution summarizes the presentations from that meeting.
Ulrike Damm provided an overview of her ongoing collaboration with Paul Cannon regarding the phylogeny of three species complexes. The project aims to delimit species within these complexes, characterize known and new species, and designate epitypes to support accurate identifications of Colletotrichum species. So far, this goal has been achieved for species with curved conidia from herbaceous hosts (Damm et al. 2009), which were previously identified primarily as C. dematium. Multi-gene analyses and morphological characterizations have revealed several diverse and distantly related species, including four new species.
This species complex includes various members. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis of strains previously identified as C. boninense demonstrated that the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) concept effectively worked for species delimitation. This resulted in clades that could be recognized as separate along currently recognized lines, with the exception of C. kahawae, which was found to be insufficiently distinct from several genetically similar non-Coffee Berry Disease-causing taxa, including C. boninense sensu stricto, Glomerella phyllanthi, and C. hippeastri, along with several presumably new species. It was suggested that this may be due to the recent emergence of C. kahawae as a pathogen in 1920, indicating that insufficient time had passed for ecological niche specialization to manifest as mutations in the genes analyzed. Consequently, it was proposed that C. kahawae be recognized at the subspecific rank.
A forthcoming publication on their work concerning the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato species complex will be featured in the 2011 issue of Studies in Mycology. The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato is a complex characterized by broad genetic and biological diversity, united by similar conidial morphology and ITS sequences. Colletotrichum acutatum causes significant economic losses in temperate, subtropical, and tropical crops, with global populations exhibiting considerable genotypic and phenotypic diversity.
Bevan Weir and Peter Johnston from Landcare Research, Auckland, New Zealand, presented their research on this species complex and potential methods for species delimitation through the GCPSR approach. Additionally, Riccardo Baroncelli from the University of Warwick, UK, discussed evolutionary relationships within C. acutatum populations in collaboration with Charles Lane from FERA, Sand Hutton, York.

Numerous putative undescribed species are referenced concerning the pathogen populations associated with the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex. Recent studies have highlighted the strawberry production systems in the UK, identifying more than 150 characterized and neotypified isolates, including C. horii and C. acutatum, related to various hosts worldwide (Weir & Johnston 2010). The GCPSR (Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition) concept was applied to delimit taxa within C. gloeosporioides sensu lato. This concept considers that phylogenetic trees generated from different genes may show discordance within a species due to gene flow between individuals. Phylogenetic analysis utilizing data from the rDNA block, Mat1-2, and Î²-tubulin-2 genes revealed eight distinct genetic groups within C. acutatum. The common node where different gene trees converge corresponds to the previously identified groups A1 to A8, and this point of concordance is considered indicative of speciation.
Almost all homothallic isolates capable of sexual reproduction belong to a single genetic group, A7. In contrast, isolates that represent populations capable of heterothallic sexual reproduction are divided into two distinct genetic groups, A3 and A5. Molecular characterization of C. acutatum populations, particularly regarding the introduction and spread of the pathogen in UK strawberry production systems, identified the presence of three genetic groups (A2, A3, and A4). These findings suggest the potential speciation processes within C. acutatum populations, related to their reproductive behaviors and host associations.
Further molecular and phenotypic characterization is ongoing, including the identification of lineage-specific expansions and contractions of gene families, particularly those undergoing rapid evolution (diversifying selection) that may be involved in interactions with host plants, such as genes encoding secreted effector proteins.
The 57.4 Mb genome of C. graminicola consists of 13 chromosomes and was sequenced at the Broad Institute (8X Sanger, 11X paired-end 454), resulting in an assembly of 1,151 contigs across 653 scaffolds. Previously, fruit rots (anthracnose) were often attributed to C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum, but identifications were frequently based on morphological characters or gene sequence data compared with incorrectly applied names. Recently, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was epitypified (Cannon et al. 2008), making living cultures and sequence data available for the first time. The 52.5 Mb genome of C. higginsianum, comprising 11 chromosomes, was sequenced using a combination of 454 (24X), Illumina paired-end (60X), and Sanger fosmid sequencing (0.2X), yielding 8,301 contigs across 367 scaffolds.
This study examines the diversity of host interactions and morphology in eight tropical fruits, focusing on appressoria formation in vitro. The appressoria that penetrate leaf epidermis are compared with the C. gloeosporioides epitype. Contrary to previous assumptions, none of the isolates from tropical fruits were identified as C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto (Phoulivong et al. 2010). The five gene regions analyzed in this study distinguished C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. horii, C. kahawae, and C. gloeosporioides as separate phylogenetic lineages with high statistical support within the C. gloeosporioides species complex.
Colletotrichum orbiculare is an anthracnose fungus that infects the Cucurbitaceae family. Yasuyuki Kubo (Kyoto Prefectural University, Japan) provided an update on the C. orbiculare genome project, conducted in collaboration with Yoshitaka Takano (Kyoto University, Japan) and Ken Shirasu (RIKEN Plant Science Center, Yokohama, Japan). This update included new typifications for C. coccodes, C. falcatum, and C. musae. The pathogenicity, morphology, and hemibiotrophic infection strategy of strain 104-T (=MAFF 240422) have been well studied, which supported the rationale for selecting this strain for genome sequencing. Furthermore, strain 104-T has shown stability in pathogenesis and morphogenesis over the years, and a variety of insertional mutants are available.
Gene manipulation techniques, such as Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation or protoplast transformation, have been established (Tsuji et al. 2003) for studies on host-parasite interactions. The model plant Nicotiana benthamiana is being used as a susceptible host. So far, several factors related to infection and morphogenesis have been identified in C. orbiculare 104-T. Essential signal transduction pathways, including the cAMP-dependent pathway and MAP kinase pathway, play a crucial role in germination, appressorium development, infection hyphae formation, and invasive growth, while the melanin biosynthesis pathway is vital for appressorium function. Various structural and regulatory genes involved in these pathways have been identified (Takano et al. 1997, Tanaka et al. 2009). Additionally, peroxisome function is essential for pathogenesis; two peroxisome biogenesis genes, PEX6 and PEX13, are critical for these processes.
Recently, it was reported that the pexophagy factor ATG26 is essential for appressorium function (Asakura et al. 2009). The genome analysis of Colletotrichum orbiculare is nearing completion, allowing for comparisons of genomic data across three Colletotrichum species: C. higginsianum, C. graminicola, and C. orbiculare, which belong to different phylogenetic clades within the genus. These data will provide a comprehensive basis for studying the biology of the different Colletotrichum species.
Alan Buddie (CABI Europe-UK, Egham, UK) is acknowledged for sharing information about the new Colletotrichum genome project. A study on host-pathogen interactions between C. orbiculare and Nicotiana benthamiana was presented by Kae Yoshino (Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University, Japan). This project is conducted in collaboration with Fumie Sugimoto, Hirofumi Yoshioka (both from the Graduate School of Agriculture, Kyoto University), Tetsuro Okuno, and Yoshitaka Takano (both from the Graduate School of Bioagricultural Sciences, Nagoya University, Japan).
Through functional screening of C. orbiculare cDNAs using the N. benthamiana-Agrobacterium tumefaciens in planta expression system, researchers identified a novel effector gene, NIS1, whose product induces cell death in N. benthamiana. Deletion of the signal peptide of Nis1 abolished its cell death activity, indicating that Nis1 is recognized in the apoplasts of N. benthamiana. GFP-based localization studies, combined with biochemical analysis, revealed that Nis1 is secreted from C. orbiculare cells during the fungal invasion phase inside plant tissue.
Nis1-mediated cell death was suppressed by virus-induced gene silencing (VIGS) of SGT1 or HSP90 in N. benthamiana, while VIGS of RAR1 had no effect. These results suggest that SGT1 and HSP90, components of R-gene mediated defenses, are involved in the Nis1-inducing cell death pathway. Surprisingly, deletion of NIS1 had no significant effect on the infection behavior of C. orbiculare on N. benthamiana. Overexpression of Nis1 in Arabidopsis thaliana led to growth reduction, implying that the NIS1-encoded effector interferes with plant development. This indicates that C. orbiculare secretes effectors that can modulate host plant responses.

This potential effector-triggered immunity might be repressed in this susceptible interaction. Moriwaki et al. (2009) announced a further genome project for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The project is a collaboration between CABI (CABI Europe-UK, Egham, UK) and The Genome Analysis Centre (TGAC), Norwich, UK (<tgac.bbsrc.ac.uk>), to carry out a whole genome sequence of the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878). The DNA sequencing phase is nearing completion, and they are about to begin the assembly process.
The meeting provided substantial evidence of the rapid advancement in our understanding of Colletotrichum genomics. This progress was nicely complemented by outputs from another Colletotrichum workshop held earlier in 2010, in conjunction with the 10th European Conference on Fungal Genetics in Leeuwenhorst, the Netherlands. It was particularly exciting to witness the increasing power of genomic research tools and their potential impact on our understanding of fungal interactions.
Perfect et al. (1999) described Colletotrichum as a model genus for studies on pathology and fungal-plant interactions.
Tanaka et al. (2009) investigated how the Colletotrichum orbiculare ssd1 mutant enhances plant basal resistance through the activation of a mitogen-activated protein kinase pathway.
Phoulivong et al. (2010) noted that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is not a common pathogen on tropical fruits.
Weir and Johnston (2010) characterized and neotypified Gloeosporium kaki Hori as Colletotrichum horii nom. nov.
These contributions reflect a diverse range of studies addressing the ecology and interactions of Colletotrichum, underscoring its significance in plant pathology.
