Various fungicides and a heat treatment were assessed for their ability to control strawberry anthracnose caused by the fungus Colletotrichum acutatum under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. The effective dose causing 50% inhibition of mycelial growth (ED50) was measured at 30.5, 12.2, 0.2, 0.15, 0.05, 0.07, and 0.05 µg/ml for the fungicides folpet, captan, propiconazole, difenoconazole, combined prochloraz-Zn/folpet, prochloraz-Zn, and prochloraz-Mn, respectively.
In laboratory experiments, infection in segments of strawberry runners treated with prochloraz-Zn reached 60%, which was significantly reduced compared to the combined prochloraz-Zn/folpet (90%), captan, folpet, and water controls (100%). In the greenhouse, the number of naturally infected transplants killed was significantly reduced by all fungicides and the heat treatment (5 minutes at 49°C) compared to the non-treated control. Prochloraz-Zn was the most effective chemical control treatment but did not differ significantly from the heat treatment.
In field experiments conducted during 1995 and 1996, the number of naturally infected strawberry transplants killed was significantly reduced by all fungicide treatments relative to the non-treated control. The percent reduction of transplant mortality in the field was 93.3%, 93.1%, 66.7%, 37.7%, and 29.1% for prochloraz-Mn, prochloraz-Zn, combined prochloraz-Zn/folpet, propiconazole, and difenoconazole, respectively.
Certain fungicides, including propiconazole, have been reported to successfully limit in vitro growth of C. fragariae, while fluazinam, a protectant fungicide, provides good control of strawberry anthracnose in post-harvest berries.
This study evaluated the fungicides prochloraz-Zn, prochloraz-Mn (both protectant sterol-biosynthesis inhibitors), captan, folpet, a combined formulation of prochloraz-Zn and folpet, propiconazole, difenoconazole, and a heat treatment for the control of C. acutatum in naturally infected strawberry plants under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Fungicides were applied at the transplant stage to determine whether a single-dip treatment is sufficient for disease control.
Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.

Leaves, flowers, and both green and ripe fruit can be highly susceptible to anthracnose, which can lead to the complete loss of fruit in some cases. In central Brazil, a recent epidemic of anthracnose caused significant yield losses, ranging from 30% to 68%. During May to September in 1995 and 1996, severe outbreaks of strawberry anthracnose were reported in many strawberry nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed due to crown rot. The causal agent was identified as Colletotrichum acutatum. Recently, various molecular techniques have been utilized to accurately and reliably identify the species of Colletotrichum responsible for strawberry anthracnose. The polymerase chain reaction (PCR) method confirmed that over 100 Israeli isolates belong to the species C. acutatum.
The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.
Three isolates of C. acutatum from naturally infected strawberry (cv. Oso Grande) plants were used in this study: TUT-40A from stolons, TUT-112A from fruit, and TUT-127A from roots. The isolates were maintained on modified Mathur’s medium (MS) at 25°C in the dark, as previously described. Cultivars Ofra, Malach (clone 156), and Hadas (clone 543), which are susceptible to strawberry anthracnose and were naturally infected with C. acutatum, were utilized in laboratory, greenhouse, and field experiments.
Fungicide-amended petri plates (9-cm diameter) were used to assess the in vitro activity of several fungicides, including captan (Marpan, 50WP), folpet (Folpan, 50WP), prochloraz-Zn (Mirage, 50WP), prochloraz-Mn (Octave, 50WP), a combination of prochloraz-Zn and folpet (Mirage-F, 15 and 60WP), propiconazole (Tilt, 25% EC), and difenoconazole (Score, 25% EC) against C. acutatum. Mycelial disks (5 mm in diameter, removed from the margins of 4- to 5-day-old cultures) were transferred to MS amended with the tested fungicides at various concentrations, ranging from 0 to 500 µg/ml. The radial growth of the mycelium was measured.
The control of Colletotrichum acutatum in naturally infected strawberry runners involved a treatment with 25 plants set in a quarter of the time to fumigate the soil and replant infected runners. A naturally randomized design was used, with disease incidence recorded for healthy plants. The mean separation of the data for infected strawberry runners (cv. Hadas), expressed as percent transplant mortality, was analyzed using Fisher’s least significant difference (LSD) test at P < 0.05. The runners were segmented into 1.5-cm sections and treated four times, with data pooled after 6 weeks.
In vitro inhibition of C. acutatum was evaluated in the Sharon region in 1995 and in the Lev Hasharon region in 1996. Transplants were submerged for 10 minutes in tap water (untreated control) or in aqueous solutions of various fungicides: captan (2.5 g/liter), prochloraz-Zn (1 g/liter), folpet (4 g/liter), combined prochloraz-Zn/folpet, and others. The effective dose causing 50% inhibition (ED50) was calculated for these fungicides. Prochloraz-Zn and prochloraz-Mn, either alone or in combination with folpet, were identified as the most effective fungicides in inhibiting C. acutatum in vitro.
Runner segments were dried on sterile Whatman filter paper and then plated on MS medium supplemented with 2.5 µg (a.i.) iprodione (Rovral 50WP, Rhone Poulenc Inc., Lyons, France) per ml to reduce contaminating fungi. Each treatment included 25 segments, with five segments per plate. The efficacy of the control was evaluated based on the growth of C. acutatum from the disinfested, fungicide-treated runners, monitored over 12 days. The experiment was repeated three times, and data were pooled. Evaluations of captan and folpet were discontinued in greenhouse and field experiments due to the high concentrations required and their limited success in inhibiting mycelial growth and controlling the pathogen under laboratory conditions.
In a greenhouse setting, various fungicides and a heat treatment, routinely used in California, were evaluated for their effectiveness against C. acutatum in naturally infected transplants (cvs. Ofra, Malach, and Hadas). Transplants were submerged for 10 minutes in tap water (non-treated control) or in solutions of the tested fungicides.
Table 1 presents the effective doses of various fungicides that resulted in 50% inhibition (ED50) of Colletotrichum acutatum in vitro. The table includes entries for captan, propiconazole, difenoconazole, prochloraz-Zn combined with folpet, prochloraz-Zn alone, and prochloraz-Mn, listing the specific concentrations needed for each to achieve the inhibition. This data highlights the comparative efficacy of these fungicides in controlling the pathogen in laboratory settings.
In a study on the control of Colletotrichum acutatum in infected strawberry plants, it was found that a 200- to 500-fold concentration of captan and folpet, along with a 750-fold concentration of azole fungicides, was necessary to achieve 50% fungal growth inhibition compared to prochloraz fungicides.
Control of C. acutatum in Infected Strawberry Runners: Results from naturally infected runners closely resembled those from in vitro experiments. Captan and folpet showed little to no effect on controlling C. acutatum. However, the survival rate of the fungus in runners was significantly reduced by prochloraz-Zn and the combined prochloraz-Zn/folpet treatments, compared to other treatments and the non-treated control throughout the experiment. After 12 days, recovery of C. acutatum from runners treated with prochloraz-Zn reached 60%, which was significantly lower than the recovery observed with the combined prochloraz-Zn/folpet treatment and the water control, which showed 90 to 100% infection.
Control of C. acutatum in Infected Strawberry Transplants in the Greenhouse: Mortality of transplants caused by C. acutatum was significantly reduced by all fungicides and heat treatment compared to the non-treated control. Prochloraz-Zn was the most effective treatment, achieving 85.6% control, though it did not differ significantly from heat treatment, which achieved 75.6% control. Other treatments, including prochloraz-Zn/folpet (50.6% control), propiconazole (33.8% control), and difenoconazole (28.8% control), were less effective than prochloraz-Zn and heat treatment. It's important to note that prochloraz fungicides, along with difenoconazole and propiconazole, caused slight phytotoxicity in the treated plants, evidenced by mild stunting and leaf scorching.
Control of C. acutatum in Field Transplants: In field trials conducted in 1995 and 1996, mortality caused by C. acutatum in naturally infected strawberry transplants was significantly reduced by all fungicide treatments compared to the non-treated control. Prochloraz-Mn and prochloraz-Zn were the most effective in reducing transplant mortality. In 1995, prochloraz-Mn reduced mortality by 93.3%, while in 1996, reductions were 86.8% for prochloraz-Mn and 93.1% for prochloraz-Zn, with no significant differences between them. Prochloraz-Zn/folpet, propiconazole, and difenoconazole were less effective than prochloraz alone. In 1995, transplant mortality was reduced by 66.7% and 37.7% with prochloraz-Zn/folpet and propiconazole, respectively. In 1996, reductions were 52.9% and 29.1% with prochloraz-Zn/folpet and difenoconazole, respectively. Similar to the greenhouse experiments, prochloraz fungicides, difenoconazole, and propiconazole exhibited slight phytotoxicity.
Prochloraz was effective in controlling strawberry anthracnose under all tested conditions; however, the current formulation of this fungicide resulted in a residual taste.
Table 2 presents the effects of various fungicides and a heat treatment on the percent mortality of strawberry plants caused by Colletotrichum acutatum in a greenhouse setting. In the study, the control group had a mortality rate of 80.0%, while treatments with different fungicides showed varying levels of effectiveness: Difenoconazole had a mortality rate of 57.2%, Propiconazole 53.5%, Prochloraz-Zn/Folpet 39.5%, and Prochloraz-Zn resulted in only 11.5%. The heat treatment was notably effective, leading to just 19.5% mortality. The data was derived from experiments involving four replicates of 25 plants each per treatment, with mortality assessed six weeks after planting. The Least Significant Difference (LSD) was calculated at 13.5% (P < 0.05), indicating significant variations between treatments.
Despite the effectiveness of Prochloraz, it should be thoroughly tested before widespread application in strawberry fruiting fields due to potential resistance or tolerance of C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species. Isolates of C. kahawae, typically highly sensitive to Prochloraz, have demonstrated acquired tolerance in culture. Similarly, isolates of C. acutatum from various hosts, including strawberries, have shown resistance to benzimidazole fungicides compared to C. gloeosporioides isolates.
In the United States, a standard heat treatment (5 minutes at 49°C) is practiced for bare-rooted transplants to control foliar nematodes and anthracnose. In this study, the heat treatment did not visibly harm transplants and significantly reduced mortality caused by C. acutatum. However, it may adversely affect plant vigor, especially for transplants meant for production fields. While this treatment could serve as an alternative to chemical fungicides, its long-term impacts on plant development and yield require further investigation. Nonchemical control methods might help minimize the emergence of fungicide-tolerant or resistant fungal strains.
The establishment of transplants in the field is a critical phase in strawberry production in Israel. Plants affected by strawberry anthracnose during this stage face significant mortality rates.
Table 3 outlines the percent mortality of strawberry transplants caused by Colletotrichum acutatum in the field during 1995 and 1996. In 1995, the control group experienced a mortality rate of 70.3%, while Prochloraz treatments resulted in 23.4% mortality, and Prochloraz-Zn showed a lower mortality of 5.2%. In 1996, the control group had a mortality rate of 75.6%, with Prochloraz at 35.6%, Prochloraz-Mn at 10.0%, and Difenoconazole at 53.6%. The data collected for mortality were assessed 34 days after transplanting in 1995 and 21 days in 1996, with various replicates used in each year. The LSD values were 22.8% for 1995 and 13.6% for 1996, calculated at P < 0.05, indicating significant differences among treatments.
