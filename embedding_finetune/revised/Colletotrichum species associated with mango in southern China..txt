Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is an economically significant fruit crop in several provinces of southern China, including Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Fujian. The objective of this study was to examine the diversity of Colletotrichum species infecting mango cultivars in major growing areas in China, utilizing morphological and molecular techniques alongside pathogenicity tests on detached leaves and fruits. Over 200 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from all the mango orchards investigated, with 128 selected for sequencing and analysis of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and β-tubulin (TUB2) genomic regions.
Our results indicated that the most common fungal isolates associated with mango in southern China included 13 species: Colletotrichum asianum, C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. The dominant species were C. asianum and C. siamense, each accounting for 30%, followed by C. fructicola at 25%. Of these, only C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. scovillei, and C. siamense have previously been reported on mango, while the other nine species listed are reported here for the first time in association with mango in China. This study also marks the first report of five species worldwide on mango: C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. liaoningense, and C. musae.
Pathogenicity tests revealed that all 13 species caused symptoms on artificially wounded mango fruit and leaves (cv. Tainong). Notably, there was no obvious relationship between aggressiveness and the geographic origin of the isolates. These findings will aid in mango disease management and future disease resistance breeding.
Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is one of the most economically important fruit crops globally, and after India, China is the second-largest mango producer. The planted area for mango in China was approximately 173,000 hectares, with a total production of 1,437,700 tons on the mainland in 2014. Major mango-producing areas in China include Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, Hainan, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces. Mango anthracnose, caused by several Colletotrichum species, is considered the most important disease affecting mango in China. Annually, mango anthracnose can account for production losses of about 30% to 60%, and under optimal conditions for the pathogen, losses can reach 100%.
Traditionally, Colletotrichum species are identified based on morphological characteristics, including conidial and appressorial size and shape, the presence of acervuli, setae, or sclerotia, sexual structures, and cultural traits such as growth rate and colony color. Distinguishing Colletotrichum species morphologically has been challenging due to their phenotypic similarities and the influence of variable environmental factors on the expression of morphological traits. Consequently, all available morphological characteristics are often combined and used for systematic species discrimination.

Morphological data is now recommended as an alternative method for accurate species identification in the genus Colletotrichum. Species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. amagnum, C. aorchidearum, C. boninense, C. dracae- nophilum, and C. gloeosporioides have been separated into many different species using morphological and molecular techniques. However, in China, the identification of Colletotrichum species on mango has mainly relied on conidial morphology and ITS sequences, and the combined data remain limited and insufficient to distinguish closely related taxa in the six species complexes mentioned above. Previous research on Colletotrichum species affecting mango has primarily focused on samples from small and fragmented provincial areas, leading to poor representation of the actual species diversity in the vast mango-growing regions of China.
In our previous study, three Colletotrichum species causing mango anthracnose in Guangxi province, China (C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense), were reported. The growing season and harvesting times of mango in seven provinces differ in environmental and climatic conditions, as well as in the varieties grown, which may lead to variations in the composition and distribution of causal agents of mango anthracnose. Genetic diversity is often related to evolutionary potential and the ability to adapt to variable environmental conditions. Based on our current understanding of the gene-for-gene hypothesis, resistance genes lose their effectiveness when faced with complex and evolving pathogen populations. An understanding of the population structure and species distribution of pathogens can provide insights into optimal breeding strategies for durable resistance to anthracnose in mangoes and improved cultural controls.
The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to identify Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose symptoms in six provinces of China using cultural characteristics, such as conidial and appressorial morphology, as well as multilocus sequencing data for phylogenetic analyses; (2) to test the aggressiveness of isolates from different geographic locations in the major mango-growing areas in mainland China; and (3) to examine the variation of isolates within and between regions.
Fungal Isolations: In 2016 and 2017, all leaves, fruits, and branches of mango with anthracnose symptoms collected from the six mango-growing provinces in China were used for fungal isolation. Based on morphological observations and ITS sequences, a total of 205 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from all investigated mango-growing regions, and 128 representative isolates were selected for further study (one isolate from each orchard, and more than one from some large orchards; 34 from Yunnan, 23 from Hainan, 18 from Guizhou, 13 from Sichuan, 16 from Guangdong, and 24 from Fujian province). The selected isolates are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Isolated species from other genera included Alternaria, Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria, and Pestalotia, which were retained for further study.

Fungal Isolations: In 2016 and 2017, leaves, fruits, and branches of mango with anthracnose symptoms were collected from six mango-growing provinces in China for fungal isolation. Based on morphological observation and ITS sequences, a total of 205 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from all investigated mango-growing regions, with 128 representative isolates selected for further study (one isolate from each orchard, and more than one from larger orchards: 34 from Yunnan, 23 from Hainan, 18 from Guizhou, 13 from Sichuan, 16 from Guangdong, and 24 from Fujian Province). The selected isolates are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Isolated species in other genera include Alternaria, Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria, and Pestalotia, which were retained for further study.
A JC model was selected for ACT, a GTR + I + G model for GAPDH, ITS, and CHS-1, and a HKY + G model for TUB2, all incorporated in the analysis. Concatenated sequences from the five loci (ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS) were generated for each of the 128 Colletotrichum isolates, along with ex-type or type strains downloaded from GenBank to generate a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). The topology of the Bayesian analysis of the combined dataset was nearly identical to that of the ML consensus tree; therefore, only the Bayesian tree is presented, with bootstrap values from the ML analysis shown on the left and posterior probabilities from the Bayesian analysis on the right of the corresponding nodes (Fig. 1).
The results showed that 38 isolates clustered with four C. asianum strains (ICMP 18605, ICMP 18603, IMI 313839, and ICMP 18580), demonstrating 100% posterior probability (PP) and bootstrap (BS) support. Additionally, 38 isolates aligned with five C. siamense strains (100% PP and 95% BS), while 32 isolates were grouped with two C. fructicola strains (ICMP 18727 and ICMP 18613) and one C. ignotum strain (CBS 125397), receiving 100% PP and 90% BS support. Five isolates clustered with strains of C. karstii (CBS 118401, CBS 128524, and CBS 128500), with 100% support; four isolates clustered with the type strain of C. endophytica (CAUG28) also showing 100% support; three isolates clustered with C. scovillei strains (CAUA1, CBS 126529, and CBS 120708), all with 100% support. Isolates YN8-2 and YN31-4 were grouped with the type strain of C. cliviicola (CBS 125375) with 100% support; isolate HN42-2 clustered with the type strain of C. gigasporum (CBS 133266) and MUCL 44947, both showing 100% support. Isolate HN32-1 clustered with the type strain of C. tropicale (CBS 124949), with 100% probability and 99% bootstrap support. Isolate GZ14-G-1 clustered with the type strain of C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878), showing 100% probability and 95% bootstrap support; isolate YN33-1 with the type strain of C. liaoningense (CAUOS2) at 100% support; isolate HN23-5 with the type strain of C. cordylinicola (ICMP 18579) at 100% PP and 88% BS; and GZ23-3 with the type strain of C. musae (ICMP 19119) at 100% support.
Morphological observations: The colonies of the Colletotrichum isolates were initially white, later turning pale gray, with sparse aerial mycelium that was hairy and sometimes produced abundant orange (hex code #FF8040) piochnotes (Fig. 2). There was high variation in mycelial growth rates among the 128 Colletotrichum isolates (Supplementary Table S3), with averages of 0.38 to 1.59 cm/day for C. asianum, 0.52 to 1.51 cm/day for C. siamense, and 0.60 to 1.19 cm/day for C. fructicola. Conidia were all hyaline, aseptate, and ranged from long elliptic to cylindrical. The average conidial sizes (as detailed in Supplementary Table S3) varied among species. For isolates grown on PDA, the length of conidia for each isolate varied, with notable variations across species.
C. theobromicola (CBS 124945) with a culture condition indicating various growth parameters.
C. karstii and C. annellatum, each with multiple culture collection identifiers, demonstrating a range of growth performance.
C. gigasporum (MUCL 44947) is highlighted for having growth metrics of 99/1 and shows significant variations compared to other species.
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences from 128 Colletotrichum isolates, including extype or epitype isolates from GenBank, based on combined genomic data (ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, and CHS-1). The numbers beside each node represent posterior probabilities and bootstrap values, indicating the reliability of the phylogenetic relationships. The analysis reveals that conidial morphology varies significantly between and within species, with the length of conidia ranging from 11.5 µm to 25.5 µm and widths from 4.0 µm to 8.2 µm. Specific observations include C. fructicola (GZ15-1) exhibiting profuse sporulation, while C. gigasporum (HN42-2) produces the largest spores, and C. scovillei (YN51-1) generates the smallest.
Conidial appressoria were gray cloud (#B6B6B4) to black (#000000), nearly elliptical or irregular in shape. The length of appressoria for each species varied from 4.9 µm to 14.9 µm, while their width varied from 3.6 µm to 10.6 µm (see Table 1). The mean length and width calculated for each isolate ranged from 6.4 µm to 12.4 µm. Mycelial appressoria were pale brown to dark brown and rod-shaped, occasionally irregular. The length of mycelial appressoria for each species varied from 5.6 µm to 20.7 µm, and their width varied from 3.5 µm to 15.4 µm.
Table 1 presents the sizes of conidial and mycelial appressoria for 13 species of Colletotrichum isolated from mango in six provinces of China. Each entry includes the mean length and width (± standard deviation) for both types of appressoria across different isolates. For instance, Colletotrichum assianum FJ18-3 shows a mean conidial size of 8.55 ± 0.51 µm in length and 7.08 ± 0.24 µm in width, and a mycelial size of 8.85 ± 0.25 µm in length and 6.58 ± 0.13 µm in width, while C. gigeosporum HN42-2 exhibits a larger size of 12.41 ± 0.41 µm by 9.36 ± 0.34 µm for conidial and 14.99 ± 0.39 µm by 12.21 ± 0.34 µm for mycelial appressoria. The measurements indicate significant variability in appressorial sizes among different Colletotrichum species.
Based on morphological observations and multilocus sequence analysis, 128 mango Colletotrichum isolates obtained in China can be classified into 13 species: 38 isolates (29.7%) of C. assianum, 38 isolates (29.7%) of C. siamense, 32 isolates (25.0%) of C. fructicola, five isolates (3.9%) of C. karstii, four isolates (3.1%) of C. endophytica, three isolates (2.3%) of C. scovillei, two isolates (1.6%) of C. cliviicola, and one isolate each of C. cordylinicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. liaoningense, C. musae, and C. tropicale. This is the first report of C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, and C. tropicale associated with mango anthracnose in China. Furthermore, this study also marks the first report of C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. liaoningense, and C. musae linked to mango anthracnose worldwide.
The provincial geographic distribution of Colletotrichum species on mango in China shows a significant diversity among the isolates, reflecting the ecological variations and host interactions in different regions.
All 128 tested isolates were pathogenic to wounded mango leaves and fruits. The aggressiveness of these isolates on mango fruits differed significantly, with lesion diameters ranging from 0.54 cm to 3.64 cm (see Supplementary Table S3). Based on the diameter sizes of the disease spots, aggressiveness was classified as strongly virulent (>2 cm), moderately virulent (>1.0 to <2 cm), or weakly virulent (<1.0 cm). Among the 128 isolates investigated, 66 (52%) were moderately virulent, 9 (7%) were strongly virulent, and 53 (41%) were weakly virulent. The least virulent strain was C. siamense SC16, while the most virulent strain was C. siamense GD7-1 (see Supplementary Table S3).
The aggressiveness of the tested isolates on mango leaves also showed significant variation, with disease lesion diameters ranging from 0.60 cm to 4.34 cm (see Supplementary Table S3). Using the same classification scale, 84 isolates (65%) were moderately virulent, 38 isolates (30%) were strongly virulent, and 6 isolates (5%) were weakly virulent. The least virulent strain in this case was C. siamense YN56-1-1, while the most virulent strain was C. siamense SC2-1 (see Supplementary Table S3).
In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.
Based on morphological characteristics and a concatenated five-gene phylogenetic analysis, the 128 Colletotrichum isolates from mango in southern China were classified into 13 species: C. asianum, C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. Four species complexes (C. acutatum, C. boninense, C. gigasporum, and C. gloeosporioides) were associated with mango.
The morphological descriptions of these isolates aligned with previous descriptions of Colletotrichum species, although cultural characteristics may vary due to differing cultural conditions. Conidial morphology alone could not distinguish all species within these complexes. Currently, 13 Colletotrichum species have been reported worldwide on mango: C. asianum, C. cliviicola, C. dianesei, C. endomangiferae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. grossum, C. kahawae, C. karstii, C. scovillei, C. siamense, C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae), and C. tropicale. Prior studies by Mo et al., Liu et al., and Qin et al. identified four Colletotrichum species (C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. scovillei, and C. siamense) prevalent on mango in China. In this study, in addition to the aforementioned species, nine other Colletotrichum species (C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, and C. tropicale) were reported for the first time on mango in China.
The present study revealed a high diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with mango from the six major mango-growing areas in China. The Colletotrichum isolates examined showed significant diversity, which may correlate with varying environmental conditions such as temperature and rainfall, as well as the sample collection time and source. The major species identified associated with mango anthracnose in China were Colletotrichum asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense. This finding aligns with the report by Vieira et al. (2014), which indicated that C. asianum was the most common endophytic species found in mango trees.
Colletotrichum asianum and C. siamense have been reported as pathogens affecting a wide variety of hosts, including Coffea arabica, Carica papaya, and Mangifera indica. Our study demonstrated that a single host species could be attacked by several Colletotrichum species, a phenomenon previously noted by Phoulivong et al. C. fructicola was initially reported on coffee berries and also exhibits a broad host range, affecting species such as Arachis sp., Citrus bergamia, and M. indica, along with a wide geographical distribution. Similarly, C. tropicale has been documented on Annona muricata, Viola surinamensis, and M. indica in Brazil.
Colletotrichum musae is a major causal agent of banana anthracnose and is associated with fruit disease spots in Musa species across various countries. C. cliviicola has been linked to anthracnose in Clivia miniata and Cymbidium hookerianum in China, as well as to Phaseolus and Saccharum species in India. It has also been found as an endophyte in M. indica in Brazil.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is recognized as a primary pathogen affecting Citrus sp., Mangifera sp., and Vitis vinifera, among many other host species, due to its classification as a species complex. The present study identified C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. musae, C. siamense, and C. tropicale as part of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. These results support previous findings that this complex is a predominant group of Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose.
Colletotrichum scovillei has been reported as a pathogen on mango and Capsicum species and is categorized within the C. acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum karstii was initially identified in orchids and has also been documented in other hosts such as Carica papaya, Citrus sp., and M. indica. This species has been found on mango and avocado fruit and is classified within the C. boninense species complex. Colletotrichum gigasporum belongs to its own species complex and is characterized by large conidia; its host range includes Acacia auriculiformis and Coffea species in Vietnam, as well as Diospyros kaki and Musa species in Japan. Colletotrichum endophytica was discovered on Pennisetum purpureum in Thailand and tea plants in China. Finally, Colletotrichum liaoningense was first reported as a pathogen of Capsicum annuum var. conoides in China.
This study has enhanced our understanding of the diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose in China. Further research is required to determine the differences in biological and infection characteristics among various Colletotrichum species affecting mango, as well as the molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences and their effects on mango anthracnose disease in the field. There have been few studies on the etiology and epidemiology of Colletotrichum species on mango. Therefore, future work on pathogenic mechanisms could be helpful for the prevention and control of mango anthracnose disease.
Collection of Samples and Isolation of Fungi: During 2016 and 2017, mango leaves, fruits, and branches exhibiting symptoms or signs of anthracnose were collected from six provinces (Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan, Sichuan, and Yunnan) in China, covering an area of 1950 km by 800 km. Mango orchards were sampled with a minimum distance of 2 km between samples. Lesion margins on mango leaves, branches, and fruits were cut into 3 mm × 3 mm pieces, surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 15 seconds, and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes, followed by three rinses in autoclaved distilled water for 30 seconds. Isolated fungi were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and kept at 25°C. Over two weeks, the cultures were examined daily. Isolates were placed on PDA slants for long-term storage at 4°C in the dark.
Morphological Characterization: Before morphological examination, isolates were cultured under continuous fluorescent light on PDA for one week at 25°C. Mycelial plugs (5 mm in diameter) were cut from colony margins and placed in 9-cm diameter Petri dishes, with four plates per isolate. The colony characteristics (color of upper and lower surfaces) and growth rate (measured in two perpendicular directions) were recorded after 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. Hyphal growth rate (cm/day) was calculated based on colony diameter. Conidial production, shape, and size were examined up to three weeks on PDA incubated at 25°C. Conidia (120 per isolate) from three-week-old PDA cultures were measured for length and width. Appressoria were produced from conidia placed on glass slides inside moist chambers. They were also produced from hyphae using a slide culture technique described by Cai et al. PDA plugs (1 cm × 1 cm) were placed in clean Petri dishes, treated with conidia, and covered with a cover slip. After 7 days, the shape and size of the appressoria were recorded. For each isolate, at least 30 appressoria were examined, and photographs were taken using a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope.
DNA Extraction, Polymerase Chain Reaction (PCR), and Sequencing: Isolates were incubated at 25°C on PDA in Petri plates overlaid with cellophane. After 7 days of growth, mycelia were harvested by scraping the cellophane with autoclaved spatulas, and DNA was extracted using a CTAB method. DNA was amplified with primers for partial actin (ACT), partial chitin synthase (CHS-1), partial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), rDNA-ITS (ITS), and partial β-tubulin (TUB2) genomic regions (refer to Supplementary Table S4). PCR amplification for ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and ITS was conducted with the primer pairs shown in Supplementary Table S4. PCR amplifications were performed in 50 µl volumes containing 4 mM MgCl₂, 1 × PCR buffer, 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), 0.2 mM concentrations of each dNTP, 0.5 µM concentrations of each primer, and 1 µl of template DNA (20 ng/µl). The PCR programs for ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB2 were set according to Mo et al. The PCR products were sequenced by Shanghai Sangon Company in China.
The sequences were compared using BLASTn against the NCBI NR database. Among the top matches, select sequences of ex-type or ex-epitype isolates of Colletotrichum species were chosen for phylogenetic analyses (Supplementary Table S2). Alignments for each gene were performed using MUSCLE v. 3.8.34. We assessed the combinability of the five gene datasets using the Partition Homogeneity Test, as implemented in PAUP* 4.0b4, following the method described by Farris et al. for the incongruence length difference (ILD) test. Sequences from the five genes were manually concatenated and realigned. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MrBayes version 3.2.6. The nucleotide substitution models for each gene, determined by jModeltest v. 2.1.7, were included for each gene partition. Following Drummond and Rambaut, four runs with four chains for 5,000,000 generations were set up, discarding the first 25%. Analyses were sampled every 1,000 generations until the average standard deviation of split frequencies fell below 0.01. Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted with the RAxML GUI v. 1.3.14, using a GTRGAMMA substitution model, and bootstrap support was calculated based on 1,000 iterations.
Pathogenicity tests were conducted following Mo et al. Select isolates were used for pathogenicity and aggressiveness tests on detached leaves and fruits of mango (cv. Tainong) under controlled conditions. Each isolate was incubated on PDA for 7 to 10 days at 25°C. Freshly harvested mango fruits and young leaves without visible disease from Tiandong (Guangxi province) were utilized for the tests. The tissues were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 seconds, followed by 1% NaClO for 1 minute, and rinsed three times in autoclaved distilled water. After air drying, detached healthy leaves (12-15 cm) were placed in plastic containers (9 cm × 17 cm × 25 cm) lined with paper toweling, and six stab wounds were made to form a 5-mm diameter circle. Mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) from the margins of PDA cultures were placed on each wound. This completely randomized trial included three replicates per isolate, with sterile agar plugs serving as controls. The containers were sealed and incubated in the dark at 25°C. Aggressiveness was assessed one week after inoculation by measuring lesion diameter.
After washing and air drying, newly ripened mango fruits (approximately 100 g) were wounded by stabbing to a depth of 3 mm, forming a 5-mm diameter circle. Mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) from PDA cultures were placed on the wounds, while sterile agar plugs were used as control treatments. Inoculated fruits were placed in plastic containers on top of moist paper toweling and sealed. The containers were then placed in a growth chamber and incubated at 25°C in the dark. Symptom development in the fruits was monitored daily for up to 10 days. Isolates were considered pathogenic when lesions expanded beyond the initial 5 mm circle of the wound. Aggressiveness was evaluated 10 days post-inoculation (dpi) by measuring lesion diameter.
Statistical analyses were performed using Data Processing System software (DPS 7.0) for Windows (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China), and data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests for means separation. All data will be available to Editorial Board Members, referees, and readers.
