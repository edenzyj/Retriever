Anthracnose crown rot of strawberry, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, is an important disease affecting California nursery and fruit production. Preplant dip treatments of transplants with fludioxonil-cyprodinil or azoxystrobin are industry standards for managing the disease and have been used extensively. Following reports of reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin in the field, high levels of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resistance were detected in California isolates of the pathogen. Resistance was associated with the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene, similar to a previous report from Florida, and there were no detected fitness penalties in pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, several alternative fungicides were investigated in laboratory and field studies. Subsequently, the new biofungicide natamycin was identified. Baseline sensitivities of 74 isolates of C. acutatum to natamycin were determined to be unimodal, with a range from 0.526 to 1.996 mg/ml (mean 0.973 mg/ml).
Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).
Salmon- to orange-colored conidial masses are produced by C. acutatum in acervuli on infected tissues at high humidity. They are spread short distances by water splash from overhead sprinkler irrigation or rainfall and long distances by infected plant material, soil associated with transplants, or contaminated equipment (Debode).

The pathogen can survive in infected plant debris and soil for at least nine months in the absence of a host (Eastburn and Gubler, 1990; Freeman et al., 2002). In fields that have been fumigated, disease outbreaks are attributed to the planting of infected nursery stock. Transplants that appear healthy may have quiescent infections that activate once conditions are favorable (Debode et al., 2015; Horn and Carver, 1968; Leandro et al., 2001), typically under warm, wet environments (King et al., 1997). Crown infections can cause the entire plant to wilt and die during the early establishment of fruit production fields, especially where overhead irrigation is common (Eastburn and Gubler, 1990). Major anthracnose crown rot outbreaks occurred in California nurseries during the 2000-01 (Daugovish et al., 2009) and 2015-16 (K. Ivors, unpublished) seasons, resulting in significant economic losses.
For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).
In addition to chemical treatments, heat treatment of transplants may reduce mortality from anthracnose, but this practice is not widely used due to its potential to reduce plant vigor (Freeman et al., 1997). In-season fungicide spray applications are common to prevent foliar and fruit infections (Koike et al., 2008; MacKenzie and Peres, 2012), but these are ineffective against crown rot and root necrosis (Daugovish et al., 2009).
Natamycin, also known as pimaricin, is a natural polyene macrolide derived from the fermentation of Streptomyces spp. (i.e., Streptomyces natalensis, S. chattanoogensis, S. gilvosporeus, and S. lydicus), and has been used as an antifungal additive in the food industry since the 1960s (Aparicio et al., 2016; Lu et al., 2008). Currently, it is registered in the United States as a biopesticide for use on mushroom beds and, more recently, as a postharvest treatment for stone fruit and citrus. Due to its unique mode of action and the fact that resistance has never been reported in filamentous fungi during its extensive use in the food industry (Aparicio et al., 2016), this fungicide could be valuable in strawberry production where QoI resistance has been reported in C. acutatum and where new rotational products are needed for dip treatments.
The purpose of this research was to evaluate new fungicides with registration potential for use as preplant dip treatments of bare-root strawberry transplants for the management of anthracnose crown rot. The specific objectives were to (i) determine whether QoI...
Fungal Isolates and Culture Methods: Seventy-four isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum were obtained in 2015 and 2016 from commercial strawberry fields in Santa Barbara, San Luis Obispo, Ventura, Santa Cruz, Stanislaus, Tehama, San Joaquin, and Merced Counties of California (Table 1). The transplant materials used to establish these fields were originally sourced from five independent nursery companies operating throughout the state (Table 1). Crowns and petioles of symptomatic plants were sectioned into small pieces (10 mm³) using a scalpel, surface-disinfested in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes, triple-rinsed with sterile distilled water, and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) acidified with 1 ml of 85% lactic acid per liter (APDA). Isolates were obtained from fruit lesions by touching a sterile cotton swab onto the lesion and then streaking the swab onto the surface of APDA plates.
Table 1 Description: The table summarizes the isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum used in this study, indicating various attributes such as the number of each isolate, the date of collection, the type of tissue sampled (crown or petiole), the county of origin, the nursery source (coded A to E), and the sensitivity to the quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) azoxystrobin. Sensitivity is denoted as either sensitive (S) or resistant (R), based on a threshold concentration that inhibits mycelial growth or conidial germination by 50% (≥1 mg/ml). Additionally, the table notes isolates that were molecularly confirmed as C. acutatum using specific primers, those used in mixtures for inoculation, and those selected for molecular characterization of QoI resistance.
Fungicides: Formulated products of natamycin (DelvoCid Instant; DSM, Heerlen, The Netherlands), azoxystrobin (Abound Flowable; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc., Greensboro, NC), chlorothalonil (Bravo Weather Stick; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.), cyprodinil (Vangard 75WG; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.), fludioxonil (Scholar 50WP; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.), and pydiflumetofen (experimental product A19649B; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.) were used on plants, either individually or in mixtures of fludioxonil and cyprodinil (Switch WG; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.) or of pydiflumetofen and fludioxonil (experimental product A20560C; Syngenta Crop Protection Inc.). Additionally, the biological control agent S. lydicus WYEC 108 (minimum of 10^3 CFU/g of formulated product; Actinovate AG; Valent U.S.A. LLC, Walnut Creek, CA) was included in field trials. Aqueous solutions were used in all studies.
Evaluation of In Vitro Sensitivity of Fungicides: Fungicide sensitivities for all isolates of C. acutatum were determined using the spiral gradient dilution method (Förster et al. 2004). Briefly, an exponential concentration gradient for each fungicide was achieved by depositing appropriate stock concentrations radially onto 15-cm PDA plates using a spiral plater (Autoplate 4000; Spiral Biotech, Inc., Norwood, MA). For azoxystrobin, PDA was amended with salicylhydroxamic acid at 100 mg/ml. Stock concentrations were 1,000 mg/ml for natamycin, 100 or 5,000 mg/ml for azoxystrobin, 200 mg/ml for chlorothalonil, 50 mg/ml for cyprodinil, 20 mg/ml for fludioxonil, and 10,000 mg/ml for pydiflumetofen. Sterile water was applied to control plates. After 2 to 4 hours, 10 ml of each conidial suspension (5 × 10^5 spores/ml) was streaked radially from the outer edge toward the center of the plate using a sterile pestle. Each isolate was replicated on opposite sides of the plate, and four isolates were evaluated on each plate. Plates were incubated in the dark for 20 hours at 20°C for evaluation of conidial germination (azoxystrobin only) or for 72 hours at 25°C for evaluation of mycelial growth. EC50 values were determined as previously described (Förster et al. 2004). Each isolate was evaluated twice for each fungicide.
Table Description: The table lists various isolates of C. acutatum along with their collection dates, the tissues from which they were taken, the counties of collection, and their sensitivity ratings. The isolates are numbered sequentially, starting from 42 up to 65, with each entry providing detailed information such as the date of collection (ranging from April 2016 to June 2016), the specific tissue type (mostly petiole or crown), the county (primarily Tehama and Ventura), and the sensitivity classification, indicated by letters such as S (sensitive) or R (resistant). This structured data provides a comprehensive overview of the isolates’ origins and their responses to treatment.
Two trials were conducted using the strawberry cultivars Portola and Fronteras (trial 1) or Monterey and Fronteras (trial 2). Bare-root transplants were obtained from two nurseries and dipped for 4 minutes with agitation in an aqueous conidial suspension (10^6 conidia/ml) of a mixture containing four QoI-sensitive and four QoI-resistant isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum.
Plants were stored at 20°C for 8 hours to allow conidia to germinate and infect, followed by storage at 5°C for up to 3 days. Subsequently, the plants were dipped in aqueous fungicide solutions for 4 minutes with agitation. Inoculated control plants were dipped in water or left untreated. Excess solution was allowed to drain for approximately 2 minutes, after which transplants were stored in plastic bags at 5°C overnight. Planting in the field occurred on March 4, 2016 (trial 1), and October 29, 2016 (trial 2), at the University of California Riverside Agricultural Operations facility. The field area had been fallow for over a year and had not previously been planted with strawberries. No fumigation treatment was applied before planting.
Plants were spaced 30 cm apart in double-row beds within a randomized complete block design. Each bed represented a block (replication) of plots, with four blocks for plants inoculated with either QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates in each study. Each treatment replication consisted of a plot of 10 plants of each cultivar.
A frequency distribution of effective concentrations to inhibit mycelial growth (A and C to F) or spore germination (B) of 74 isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum by 50% (EC50 values) was determined using the spiral gradient dilution method. The bar height in the graph represents the number of isolates within each bin, with bin widths calculated using Scott's method. For the determination of bin width for azoxystrobin evaluations, only values from sensitive isolates were considered.
Overhead irrigation was applied three days each week for 30 minutes each in the morning and afternoon during the first month. Drip irrigation was employed for two days each week for two hours throughout the study. Fertilizer was applied through drip irrigation weekly or biweekly. No foliar fungicides or insecticides were used.
Plants were periodically evaluated for disease. Fungal isolations were performed on diseased tissues from 15 randomly selected symptomatic plants inoculated with either QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates to confirm that C. acutatum was the causal agent. Isolations from crown, leaf, and fruit tissues were conducted as previously described, except that the tissues were plated onto PDA amended with ampicillin (130 mg/ml) and rifampicin (20 mg/ml). Field evaluations for disease severity on aboveground growth occurred after 5 weeks (trial 1) or 14 weeks (trial 2) using the following scale: 0 = healthy, vigorous plant; 1 = growth reduced; 2 = growth and vigor reduced, less than 50% of the size of healthy plants; 3 = growth and vigor extremely reduced, less than 25% of the size of healthy plants; and 4 = plant dead. Severity ratings were averaged for each 10-plant replication. The incidence of plant mortality was calculated based on the number of dead plants (rating = 4) among the 10 plants of each cultivar in each replication.
Crop yield was assessed using the Fronteras cultivar. In trial 1, a single harvest of all mature red, commercially acceptable fruit from each treatment replication was conducted 10 weeks after planting, and the fruits were weighed. In trial 2, flowers and immature fruit were removed 7 and 12 weeks after planting to encourage vegetative growth during the winter period, in line with commercial practices. All mature red, commercially acceptable fruit were harvested 20 and 23 weeks after planting, and the weights from the two harvests for each treatment replication were combined.
Fig. 2. Effect of fungicide dip treatments of A and B (Portola); C and D (Monterey); or E and F (Fronteras) strawberry transplants inoculated with a mixture of four isolates—each of A, C, and E (quinone outside inhibitor [QoI]-sensitive) or B, D, and F (QoI-resistant) isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum on disease severity. Plants were evaluated after 5 or 14 weeks for aboveground vegetative growth based on a rating scale of 0 = healthy, vigorous plant; 1 = growth reduced; 2 = growth and vigor reduced; 3 = growth and vigor extremely reduced; and 4 = dead. Average disease severity was determined based on 10 plants for each of four replications in each experiment. Bars followed by the same letter within a graph are not significantly different based on least significant difference mean separation (P > 0.05) procedures. Rates are based on active ingredient, except for Streptomyces lydicus, where the rate is based on the formulated product.
In the range of sensitivity, mean EC50 values for mycelial growth or spore germination were plotted for each fungicide in frequency distributions according to Scott's method (Scott 1979).
Data for incidence of mortality were arcsin-transformed, while yield data were transformed using y = log10(x + 1) prior to statistical analysis for both trials. All data for disease severity, incidence of mortality, and yield were normally distributed according to the Shapiro-Wilk test. Data were combined from different experiments when variances were homogeneous according to Bartlett's test. Analyses of variance or generalized linear model procedures were performed following a factorial design with cultivar, inoculum type, and fungicide treatment as the main factors. When interactions between cultivar and inoculum type were significant, data were analyzed separately for each combination, with treatment as the single factor. Multiple comparisons for treatment means were conducted using Fisher's least significant difference test. All statistical procedures were performed using SAS (version 9.4; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC), with a significance value of α = 0.05.
In vitro sensitivity of isolates of C. acutatum to fungicides. Of the 74 isolates tested, 29 were determined to be QoI-resistant, with EC50 values for mycelial growth and conidial germination higher than 40 mg/ml. The remaining 45 isolates were QoI-sensitive, with mean EC50 values for mycelial growth and germination inhibition of 0.034 mg/ml (range 0.015 to 0.064 mg/ml) and 0.129 mg/ml (range 0.060 to 0.267 mg/ml), respectively. Mean EC50 values for mycelial growth for all 74 isolates for chlorothalonil, cyprodinil, fludioxonil, and natamycin were 0.267 mg/ml (range 0.115 to 0.549 mg/ml), 0.025 mg/ml (range 0.012 to 0.390 mg/ml), 0.001 mg/ml (range 0.0006 to 0.0014 mg/ml), and 0.973 mg/ml (range 0.526 to 1.996 mg/ml), respectively. Sensitivity data are presented separately for QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. For azoxystrobin, a >1,000-fold difference in sensitivity between sensitive and resistant groups was observed. No significant differences in sensitivity to cyprodinil (P = 0.3468), fludioxonil (P = 0.2556), and natamycin (P = 0.1010) were found for QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. For chlorothalonil, QoI-sensitive isolates were significantly less sensitive (mean EC50 value of 0.276 mg/ml) than QoI-resistant isolates (mean EC50 value of 0.250 mg/ml). Pydiflumetofen was not inhibitory to mycelial growth at concentrations of up to 80 mg/ml tested.
Frequency distributions of EC50 categories for each fungicide are shown in the histograms of Figure 1A to F. Distributions for all fungicides were unimodal, except for azoxystrobin, where a bimodal distribution was observed.
The overall models for disease severity and mortality measurements, as well as for the independent variables cultivar, type of inoculum (i.e., QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates of C. acutatum), and treatment, were highly significant (P < 0.0001). Significant interactions were found between cultivar and treatment, as well as between type of inoculum and treatment (P < 0.0001), but not between cultivar and type of inoculum (P = 0.8133 for severity and P = 0.0564 for mortality). Due to these interactions, data were analyzed separately for each cultivar and inoculum type.
In Trial 1, Fronteras was significantly less susceptible to anthracnose crown rot (mean severity 1.4, mean mortality 24.9%) compared to Portola (mean severity 2.3, mean mortality 52.2%). Similarly, in Trial 2, Fronteras showed significantly lower susceptibility (mean severity 1.6, mean mortality 22.4%) than Monterey (mean severity 2.2, mean mortality 39.9%). Inoculation with QoI-resistant isolates resulted in significantly higher disease severity (mean 2.1) and incidence of mortality (mean 40.7%) than when using QoI-sensitive isolates (mean severity 1.6, mean mortality 29.0%).
Disease severity and mortality incidence for untreated, inoculated control plants were high at evaluation time—5 weeks after springtime planting of Portola and 14 weeks after fall planting of Monterey strawberry. Following inoculation with QoI-sensitive isolates, disease severity was 3.5 and 3.2, and incidence of mortality was 85.0% and 69.1% for untreated Portola and Monterey controls, respectively. With QoI-resistant isolates, these values increased to 4.0 and 3.4 for severity, and 100% and 74.6% for mortality for the two cultivars. In contrast, the average disease severity and mortality for Fronteras planted in the spring or fall were 2.1 and 32.9% for QoI-sensitive inoculum, and 2.5 and 47% for QoI-resistant inoculum.
Fungal isolations from diseased tissues of randomly selected symptomatic plants confirmed C. acutatum as the causal agent of the disease symptoms. Water dip treatments of transplants were generally ineffective in reducing disease and mortality compared to untreated controls, resulting only in a significant (P < 0.05) reduction in disease severity for Monterey inoculated with QoI-resistant isolates.
Transplants of all three strawberry cultivars inoculated with either QoI-sensitive or -resistant isolates and dip-treated with natamycin at both rates, or with the pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil or fludioxonil-cyprodinil premixes, showed significantly (P < 0.05) lower disease severity and plant mortality compared to controls. There were generally no significant (P > 0.05) differences among these four treatments, with the new fungicides providing similar control to the registered premix of fludioxonil and cyprodinil. Among the six cultivar-inoculum combinations, the 0.5 g/liter rate of natamycin was significantly (P > 0.05) less effective than the 1 g/liter rate only for Portola inoculated with QoI-resistant isolates. No stunting of plants or other signs of phytotoxicity were observed in any treatment during these trials.
Treatments with azoxystrobin provided a high level of disease control when transplants were inoculated with QoI-sensitive isolates of the pathogen, with efficacy similar to that of natamycin or the two premixes containing fludioxonil. However, azoxystrobin was not effective when plants were inoculated with QoI-resistant isolates.
Table 2 Description: Table 2 presents the effective concentrations of fungicides required to inhibit 50% of mycelial growth or conidial germination for both QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum. It likely includes specific concentrations (EC50 values) for each fungicide tested, categorized by the type of isolate, highlighting the differential effectiveness of various fungicides against the pathogen based on its resistance profile.
The table summarizes the efficacy of various fungicides at different growth stages, detailing the mean and range of their effects on mycelium and conidia. For QoI-sensitive isolates treated with azoxystrobin, the mean values for mycelium and conidia were 0.034 (range: 0.015 to 0.064) and 0.129 (range: 0.060 to 0.267), respectively. In contrast, QoI-resistant isolates showed significantly higher mean values: mycelium was >40, and conidia were also >40, with no available data (NA) for the range. Other fungicides such as chlorothalonil, cyprodinil, fludioxonil, natamycin, and pydiflumetofen were assessed, demonstrating varying levels of efficacy against mycelium and conidia. Chlorothalonil showed inconsistent performance, reducing disease severity in five of the six cultivar-inoculum combinations, while pydiflumetofen was less effective, with notable reductions only in QoI-sensitive isolates for Monterey.
In a separate analysis regarding the effects of pre-plant dip treatments on fruit yield, the data were processed separately for each trial, considering harvest timing and frequency. Generally, the yield data corresponded with the treatments’ performance in mitigating disease severity and plant mortality. Water dip treatments did not enhance yield compared to the untreated control, except in the first trial with QoI-sensitive inoculum. Natamycin treatments achieved yields comparable to the industry-standard fludioxonil-cyprodinil mixture. However, azoxystrobin-treated transplants exhibited higher yields than the untreated control but were similar in effectiveness to natamycin and fludioxonil treatments when inoculated with QoI-sensitive isolates. When faced with QoI-resistant isolates, azoxystrobin yielded results comparable to the untreated control.
The remaining treatments—water control, S. lydicus, pydiflumetofen, and chlorothalonil—did not significantly differ from the untreated control in the first trial. However, in the second trial, both chlorothalonil and S. lydicus significantly increased yields from the untreated control in transplants inoculated with QoI-sensitive isolates. Overall, natamycin, fludioxonil-containing treatments, and azoxystrobin (in the case of QoI-sensitive isolates) achieved the highest numerical yields across all treatments.
The results from the figures indicate the effect of fungicide dip treatments on plant mortality. Plants were assessed after either 5 or 14 weeks, and average mortality was calculated based on the number of dead plants from ten plants per replication. Statistical significance was determined, with similar letters indicating no significant differences based on the least significant difference mean separation (P > 0.05).
QoI resistance was first described in C. acutatum from strawberries in Florida in 2013 (Forcelini et al. 2016). The G143A and F129L mutations in cytb were identified, conferring high and moderate resistance levels, respectively. In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fernández-Ortuño et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011). Additionally, this mutation has been shown to be stable in C. acutatum populations and did not result in a fitness penalty in laboratory assays (Forcelini et al. 2018). In our study, QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were similarly pathogenic; however, disease severity and mortality after inoculation with resistant isolates were higher than those for QoI-sensitive isolates. Several studies on other fungal pathogens have indicated that resistant isolates harboring the G143A mutation did not exhibit reduced fitness compared to wild-type sensitive isolates (Corio-Costet et al. 2011; Karaoglanidis et al. 2011; Rallos et al. 2014). In contrast, the fitness of resistant isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae was reduced (Ma and Uddin 2009).
In vitro toxicities of chlorothalonil, cyprodinil, fludioxonil, and natamycin all exhibited unimodal distributions of sensitivities. Although cyprodinil and fludioxonil have been used for many years in California strawberry production, no resistant isolates were detected in our samplings, reflecting current sensitivity levels in C. acutatum populations at the sampling locations. A high in vitro activity of the fludioxonil-cyprodinil premixture was previously determined for C. truncatum (Torres-Calzada et al. 2015), and the values were similar to those in our evaluation of the individual active ingredients. Since natamycin has never been used in commercial strawberry production, the EC50 values determined can be considered a baseline sensitivity for future resistance monitoring.
Treatments were evaluated as dips for transplants because planting material is a primary source of introducing Colletotrichum acutatum into a field. Currently, dip treatments for transplants are a common practice in California for establishing new strawberry fields. Our results showed that plant mortality was significantly reduced by natamycin and fludioxonil-cyprodinil when transplants were inoculated with both QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. Under highly favorable disease conditions, additional foliar treatments will need to be applied to protect plants from petiole and leaf lesions, as well as fruit rot throughout the season. These treatments can be integrated with those for managing gray mold caused by Botrytis spp.
The experimental fungicide pydiflumetofen was not effective against C. acutatum in our in vitro and field studies. However, this fungicide is very active against B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew in strawberries (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.
(x+1), and the results were analyzed using analysis of variance, with mean separation based on least significant difference (P < 0.05). Mean values within each column that share the same letter are not significantly different.
The table details the treatment rates (in grams per liter), specifying that the rates are based on the active ingredient, except for Streptomyces lydicus, where the rate is based on the formulated product. The data are divided into sensitive and resistant categories for each treatment. The various treatments, including Streptomyces lydicus WYEC 108, pydiflumetofen, azoxystrobin, fludioxonil/cyprodinil, and pydiflumetofen/fludioxonil, show differing effects on fruit yield, with numerical values indicating the mean fruit weight under each condition.
