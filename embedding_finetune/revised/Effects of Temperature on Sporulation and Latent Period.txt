King, W. T., Madden, L. V., Ellis, M. A., and Wilson, L. L. (1997). Effects of temperature on sporulation and latent period of Colletotrichum spp. infecting strawberry fruit. Plant Disease, 81, 77-84.
The effects of temperature on the sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae, the causes of anthracnose in strawberries, were determined through controlled-environment studies. Detached immature fruits were inoculated with a conidial suspension and incubated for up to 36 days at constant temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C. The latent period (the time until the first sporulation) varied with temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25°C to 6 to 17 days at 5°C. At lower temperatures (5 and 10°C), C. acutatum exhibited a shorter latent period compared to the other species, while at higher temperatures, the latent periods among the species were similar.
During the initial 4 days of sporulation, an optimum-type relationship was observed between the logarithm of conidia per fruit (log(Y)) and temperature. Maximum sporulation (generally between 10^6 and 10^7 conidia per fruit) occurred at temperatures ranging from 15 to 30°C. Sporulation consistently increased over time at temperatures of 15°C and above. The most significant differences among the species occurred at 5 and 10°C, where the tested isolates of C. acutatum produced 10 to 100 times more conidia per fruit than the other species. Polynomial regression equations effectively represented log(Y) as a function of temperature and incubation time, with the rate of sporulation increase dependent on temperature, predicting an optimum range of 22 to 26°C. The equations were validated by predicting sporulation in fruits attached to plants growing in controlled-environment chambers, showing a mean error of only –0.7% (95% confidence interval: –2.4 to 1.0%).
Anthracnose of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) has become a major constraint on strawberry production in the United States. While C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae are often associated with infection of plant parts other than the fruit, both species are capable of infecting and rotting the fruit, leading to significant yield losses. The extensive use of fungicides is often necessary to manage this disease, and methods to reduce the number of spray applications or optimize the timing of fungicide applications are needed. Disease forecasting, based on environmental conditions, may provide additional management strategies.
Sanadla (1996) reported research supported by the Ohio State University’s Research and Development Center. Using regression analysis, they found that certain weather variables were most correlated with disease incidence. The best regression model for disease incidence was based on the amount of rainfall (in cm), days since the introduction of inoculum, an index of infection (on a scale of 0 to 1), wetness duration, temperature, and distance from the spore source. Notably, only half of the variation in disease incidence was explained by this equation. The researchers suggested that inoculum production, alongside other factors, might account for the unexplained variability. While several studies indicated the potential importance of sporulation in the epidemiology of Colletotrichum acutatum, no reports quantified sporulation rates for this pathogen. Additionally, there is very limited epidemiological research on Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in strawberries.
The long-term goal of this research was to understand why C. acutatum has recently become the dominant fruit-rotting pathogen and to provide information that could help in timing fungicide applications. The specific objectives included: (i) determining the latent periods and sporulation of Colletotrichum species infecting strawberry fruit in relation to temperature and incubation time, (ii) comparing the sporulation and latent periods of selected isolates from three Colletotrichum species, and (iii) quantifying sporulation and latent periods in relation to temperature and incubation time using regression analysis.
Inoculum Production: Isolates of C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides were obtained from infected strawberry fruit collected from various regions of the United States. All cultures were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in 100 × 15 mm petri dishes. Conidia from 2-week-old cultures were streaked onto new PDA plates weekly using a sterilized probe. To ensure the pathogenicity of the isolates, conidia from previously inoculated fruit were streaked onto new PDA plates every two weeks. Cultures were maintained at 26°C with 12 hours of light (51 µE s–1 m–2) daily.
Inoculum for fruit inoculations was prepared by scraping plates and suspending conidia in 20 ml of deionized water. The spore suspensions were vortexed for 1.5 minutes and then adjusted to 2.5 × 10^4 conidia/ml using a hemacytometer. Based on preliminary experiments, this was the lowest spore density that resulted in 100% fruit infection.
Plant Maintenance: Strawberry plants (cv. Midway), obtained as transplants from Brittinghams Nursery (Salisbury, MD), were grown in 15-cm-diameter pots filled with a mixture of sand, peat, and steam-disinfected loam (1:2:2, vol/vol/vol). New plants were planted weekly, and the plants were maintained in a greenhouse at the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center. Preliminary studies found that lesion appearance coincided with the timing of the first sporulation.
General methods were similar to those described by Madden et al. (21) and Yang et al. (37, 38). Detached fruit, with pedicels intact, were collected from strawberry plants at the white stage, which is when chlorophyll breakdown occurs. The fruit was placed in 50 ml of deionized water and agitated for 1.5 minutes. After removal, the spore suspension was vortexed for another 1.5 minutes. Four 10-µl samples were placed on a hemacytometer to calculate the density of conidia per milliliter, with the mean of the samples used to represent each fruit. Each test was conducted at least three times, with each species, isolate, and temperature combination tested in random order.
Effects of free surface moisture on sporulation were investigated. A limited set of temperature and incubation time combinations were tested with the OH and MS isolates of C. acutatum, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL to determine if moisture on strawberry fruit affected sporulation. The procedures followed were the same as in the previously described experiment, except that lids remained on the tubs during the entire incubation period. The fruit were inoculated by spraying them with an atomizer until runoff was visible. Lids were placed on the tubs to maintain free moisture on the fruit surface and keep relative humidity (RH) above 80%. RH was measured in a separate tub without fruit by placing wet-bulb and dry-bulb thermistors immediately over the mesh. Temperature was recorded every 10 minutes to ensure consistent conditions.
Tubs were placed in an incubator set at 26°C for 24 hours. After this period, the lids of the tubs were removed, and the tubs were placed in an incubator set to one of the following temperatures: 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, or 35°C. The duration of incubation ranged from 2 to 36 days, depending on the temperature (see Results). The sporulation of C. acutatum OH, C. acutatum MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL was evaluated for all seven temperatures, while sporulation of the other isolates was assessed only at 15, 20, 25, and 30°C. The sporulation results [in log(conidia); see data analysis below] were divided by log(conidia) from tests without free moisture and multiplied by 100 to achieve a percentage scale.
Sporulation on infected fruit attached to plants was assessed for C. acutatum OH and MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL to validate results from detached fruit.
Table 1 describes the sources and designations of the Colletotrichum species used in this study. The table includes details such as isolate designations and their corresponding sources. For example, the OH isolate (#90170) is from The Ohio State University, while the MS isolate (Mil - 1) was sourced from B. Smith at USDA, Mississippi. Other isolates are attributed to different institutions, indicating their geographic origins and the researchers involved in their collection.
Attached fruit studies involved growing strawberry plants in a greenhouse, as described previously. Plants were selected when the fruit reached the white stage. The inoculation procedures were similar to those described by Wilson et al. (35) and in previous sections, except that the pedicels of the fruit were held while the fruit were sprayed with an atomizer. Immediately after inoculation, the plants were placed in a controlled environmental chamber (Rheem Manufacturing Company, Asheville, NC) and misted for 24 hours with a Hermidifier mister (Hermidifier Co., Lancaster, PA). The plants were then transferred to another chamber, set to one of the following temperatures: 15, 20, 25, or 30°C. Lights were turned on for 14 hours daily, providing a light intensity of 190 µE s–1 m–2. The relative humidity (RH) in the chamber averaged 40% to 60%.
Five fruits were sampled starting when lesions appeared, and sporulation was assessed as previously described. This assessment continued from 2 to 28 days, depending on the temperature. Not all four temperatures were evaluated for every isolate due to limitations in plant production in the greenhouse, resulting in variations in the number of incubation times. Each test was conducted between one to three times.
Data Analysis: The effects of temperature (T) and incubation time (I) on the number of conidia produced per fruit (Y) were quantified through regression analysis (19, 23). Regression models were developed based on the following assumptions: (i) an optimal-type relationship between Y and T, where Y increases to a maximum before decreasing; and (ii) a monotonic relationship between Y and I, where the minimum value of Y is zero. Logarithmic polynomial models (4, 23) were fitted to the sporulation data.
An overall regression model for each isolate was developed through separate regression analyses at each temperature. At each temperature, log(Y) was regressed on I or log(I + 1) to find the most suitable equation for sporulation over time. The logarithmic transformation of Y was employed to stabilize variances in sporulation. To identify the best relationship between Y and T, log(Y) for the first four days of sporulation (referred to as “initial sporulation”) was regressed on polynomial terms of temperature (without including time). Each equation tested utilized two of the following terms: T, T², T³, and T⁴. Separate regression equations were calculated for each species and isolate.
An overall polynomial model for sporulation was developed based on the above results, expressed in the general form log(Y) = f(I,T) (equation 1), where f(I,T) represents a linear function of some of the following terms: I, log(I + 1), log(I + 1)T, log(I + 1)T², log(I + 1)T³, and log(I + 1)T⁴. Randomness and normality of residuals were evaluated as described in Neter et al. (23) to ensure the equations were appropriate for representing the data and that statistical assumptions were met. The significance of the model coefficients (estimated parameters) was determined using t-tests. Coefficients of determination (R²) and adjusted R² were calculated to measure the proportion of variation explained by the models. Regression analysis was conducted for each experimental repetition separately and for pooled data across species and isolates.
The square root of the mean square error (the standard error about the best-fitting regression line) was used to calculate the standard error of the difference (SED) and the least significant difference (LSD) between means. The latent period (L) was modeled with the equation log(L) = b₀ + b₁T + b₂T².
The weight of fruit (W) and the estimated percent area of fruit covered with lesions (A) were correlated with log(Y) for the OH and MS isolates.
Figure 1 illustrates the sporulation of isolates of (A) Colletotrichum acutatum, (B) C. gloeosporioides, and (C) C. fragariae in relation to temperature during incubation. Each point represents the number of conidia produced per fruit over the first four days after spore production began. Labels (e.g., CA) indicate the state of origin. The least significant differences (P = 0.05) for C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae were 0.31, 0.33, and 0.45 in log units, respectively.
Isolates of C. acutatum, particularly the MS isolate, sporulated similarly at temperatures between 15 and 30°C (Fig. 1C). In contrast, the C. gloeosporioides isolates showed a significant difference at 30°C (Fig. 1B), with the NC isolate producing more than ten times the number of conidia per fruit compared to the FL isolate. Separate correlation coefficients were calculated for each isolate. The best-fitting model for sporulation of detached fruit was used to predict sporulation on attached fruit in controlled-environment chambers. Temperature (T) and incubation time (I) were based on conditions with attached fruit, but model parameters were obtained from detached-fruit studies. A prediction interval was determined for each T and I combination using methods from Neter et al. (23).
Sporulation of C. acutatum OH and MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL was virtually constant over time at both 5 and 10°C (Figs. 2 and 3). As temperatures increased (≥15°C), sporulation increased over time for the tested isolates. The C. acutatum isolates produced more spores at lower temperatures (Fig. 2A,D) than the isolates of the other two species (Fig. 3A,C). After sporulation began, maximum sporulation during the first four days occurred around 25°C. With longer incubation times (at least 14 days), maximum sporulation occurred at 15°C for C. acutatum CT and MS (Fig. 2B,D), C. gloeosporioides FL (Fig. 3A), and C. fragariae MS and NC (Fig. 3C,D). However, these longer durations could not be tested at higher temperatures due to fruit degradation.
Data Analysis of Sporulation: The polynomial equation that best described the logarithm of sporulation per fruit [log(Y)] in relation to incubation time at each temperature was log(Y) = b0 + b1 log(I + 1) (equation 3), where b0 and b1 are parameters (16; results not shown). Generally, a significant and positive relationship was evident between log(Y) and log(I + 1) at middle temperatures (15 to 30°C). Slopes (b1) were significantly greater than zero (P < 0.05), with R² values indicating a strong fit at these middle temperatures.

are parameters (see Table 2). R² values ranged from 11.9% to 52.2%. Individual F tests showed significant differences in model results among the three species (P < 0.05). The F tests also indicated differences among isolates within a species (P < 0.05), highlighting variations in means as described previously. However, no significant differences (P > 0.10) were noted among repetitions.

Sporulation of isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. fragariae: (A) FL isolate; (B) NC isolate—C. gloeosporioides; (C) MS isolate; (D) NC isolate—C. fragariae, evaluated at temperatures between 5 to 35°C over incubation time (days). Each point represents the mean number of conidia per fruit across replications. The least significant differences (P = 0.05) for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae were 0.46 and 0.58 in log units, respectively. See Table 1 for definitions of isolate-designation abbreviations.
Table 2 Summary: This table lists the estimated parameters of equation 4, which describes the relationship between the log-transformed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberry fruit [log(Y)] and temperature (T) during early sporulation. It also includes the coefficients of determination (R²), adjusted R², standard errors about the regression line, and degrees of freedom. Data analyzed were from the first 4 days after sporulation commenced.
R² values were 63%, 55%, 71%, and 54% for C. acutatum in Ohio (OH), Mississippi (MS), California (CA), and Connecticut (CT), respectively (see Table 3). As with other analyses, these statistics are based on individual replicate data rather than means. The C. fragariae isolates from MS and North Carolina (NC) and C. gloeosporioides showed similar R² values. The b2 parameter of equation 5 was generally negative, indicating a decline in sporulation at the highest temperatures. However, when the b1 parameter estimate was not significantly different from zero and was omitted from the equation, b2 became positive (as seen in C. fragariae NC; see Table 3).
The b1 and b3 parameters had an inverse relationship; specifically, b3 was negative when b1 was above 0.158, not significantly different from zero when b1 was between 0.060 and 0.158, and positive when b1 was below 0.060. Equation 5 can be rewritten as log(Y) = b0 + I¢(b1T + b2T³ + b3) (equation 6), which illustrates the linear relationship between the logarithm of sporulation [log(Y)] and transformed incubation time (I¢), with a slope (b1T + b2T³ + b3) that depends on temperature.
Regarding the effects of fruit weight, lesion area, and free surface moisture on sporulation, low and nonsignificant correlation coefficients (P > 0.20) were observed between fruit weight (W) and sporulation in the analyses. The correlation coefficients were –0.17, –0.08, 0.04, and 0.15 for C. acutatum OH, C. acutatum MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL, respectively. In contrast, a positive and significant correlation (P < 0.05) was found between sporulation and the estimated percent area (A) of fruit covered by lesions. The correlation coefficients were 0.47, 0.70, 0.63, and 0.31 for C. acutatum OH, C. acutatum MS, C. fragariae MS, and C. gloeosporioides FL, respectively, indicating a relationship between lesion size and conidia numbers. Similar results were obtained for individual temperatures.
Sporulation with free surface moisture on fruit surfaces was somewhat less than that without moisture. The decline in sporulation was not significantly influenced by species or isolates. C. acutatum MS and OH produced an average of 11.6% and 16.3% fewer conidia, respectively, on fruit with free surface moisture compared to those without. C. gloeosporioides FL and C. fragariae MS produced 15.7% and 10.1% fewer spores, respectively.
The latent period (L) decreased as temperatures increased (see Fig. 4). The latent period ranged from 6 to 17 days at 5°C and from 2 to 6 days at temperatures between 25 to 35°C. The C. acutatum isolates had shorter latent periods compared to the other two species at lower temperatures. For instance, at 5°C, the latent period averaged 7 days for C. acutatum MS and 11 days for C. acutatum OH, while it averaged 17 days for C. fragariae MS and 14 days for C. gloeosporioides FL. At 25°C, the latent period for all isolates, except for C. acutatum MS, was 2 days. From 20 to 35°C, the latent periods were quite similar across all isolates and species.
Latent period was best described by equation 2, which had R² values above 90% for all isolates (see Table 4). All coefficients were significantly different from zero, and significant differences (P < 0.05) were noted among isolates and species, primarily due to variations in L at lower temperatures. In most cases, measured sporulation was similar to that predicted by equation 5 (see Table 3), with parameters estimated using detached fruit. The 95% prediction interval based on the model results for detached fruit typically included the observed sporulation values.

Discussion: Sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. affecting strawberry fruit was significantly influenced by temperature and incubation time. Generally, there was an optimum-type relationship between conidia production and temperature, with maximum sporulation observed at certain temperatures.
Table 5. Sporulation of Colletotrichum spp. infecting strawberry fruit attached to plants in a controlled-environment chamber. This table shows the observed and predicted log conidia per fruit at various temperatures and incubation times, along with the 95% prediction intervals.
For each isolate, specific temperature conditions and days of incubation are detailed, with the observed and predicted values of log conidia per fruit presented alongside the confidence intervals, illustrating the relationship between temperature, incubation time, and sporulation.
The data summarizes the sporulation rates of different isolates of Colletotrichum species under varying temperatures and incubation times. For example, the table includes values indicating sporulation at various temperature settings, with readings taken at multiple time points. The isolates are labeled with abbreviations such as "C. fragariae" and "C. gloeosporioides," along with their corresponding sporulation values and temperature ranges.
The results show that sporulation is notably affected by temperature, particularly around 25°C, with significant conidia production observed especially within the first four days of initiation. It was found that higher temperatures (above 10°C) correlated with increased conidia production, and the number of conidia was directly related to the percentage of fruit covered by lesions. Additionally, the time until the first sporulation (latent period) decreased as temperatures increased.
Sporulation patterns among the three species were qualitatively similar yet quantitatively distinct. The most significant variation occurred at 5 and 10°C, where C. acutatum demonstrated substantially higher sporulation rates compared to the other species. Conversely, at temperatures near 25°C, sporulation rates among all isolates converged, with C. gloeosporioides FL showing the lowest sporulation levels.
A polynomial regression model (equations 5 or 6) effectively described the relationship between sporulation (on a log scale), temperature, and incubation time. Although the R² values were relatively low, they were based on fitting the equations to individual replicate data rather than means, suggesting that all terms in the model (equation 5) were significant.
The incubation temperature was maintained at 15°C; however, long incubation times were only tested at relatively low temperatures due to the rapid degradation and decay of fruit at temperatures above 20°C. At shorter incubation times, greater sporulation was consistently observed at 25°C compared to 15°C. Regression analysis results (equation 6; see Table 3) indicated that the slope was directly related to temperature, confirming that the optimum temperature ranged from 22 to 26°C. Although the most detailed data collection and analysis in this study focused on detached fruit, similar results were obtained with infected fruit still attached to plants (see Table 5). Using four isolates and a limited selection of temperatures and incubation times, conidia production on attached fruit was reasonably predicted by the equations developed for detached fruit. The 95% prediction interval almost always included the observed values, although the intervals were wide due to variability in the detached fruit data. The average difference between observed and predicted log(Y) was –0.037 (standard error = 0.057), demonstrating the overall accuracy of the predicted sporulation compared to the observed values. This mean difference in log units corresponds to a ratio of the median observed to predicted spores (not in logarithmic form) of 0.92, indicating that the predictions tended to be slightly higher than the observed values. Differences could be attributed to lower relative humidity (RH) in the chambers with plants compared to the containers with detached fruit, as well as physiological differences between detached and attached fruit.
Wilson et al. (35) previously studied the effects of temperature and wetness duration on the infection of mature and immature strawberry fruit by the Ohio isolate of Colletotrichum acutatum. They found a similar relationship between fruit infection and temperature, as observed here for sporulation. There was a linear increase in logit-transformed fruit disease incidence with wetness duration, with a slope described by a polynomial function of temperature. The optimum temperature for infection was found to be between 25 and 30°C. Relationships between epidemiological processes (i.e., infection and sporulation) and temperature and/or wetness duration for Colletotrichum species have also been studied with other hosts. For instance, Denham and Waller (6) observed an increase in disease incidence in citrus caused by C. gloeosporioides, correlating with an increase in wetness duration after rain events during flowering periods. They utilized field studies on disease incidence, alongside assessments of flower development, blossom patterns, and climatic data, in their observations. Fitzell et al. (10) developed a polynomial model based on laboratory studies that predicted the infection of mangoes by C. gloeosporioides var. minor, taking into account both temperature and wetness duration. This model accounted for 87% of the total variation based on laboratory results.
Surprisingly, free surface moisture was not required for sporulation. However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production. Therefore, it remains unknown whether other Colletotrichum species are similarly affected by moisture. We speculate that the pathogen acquires sufficient moisture from ripening strawberry fruit to produce conidia.
Similar to sporulation, the latent period was described by a polynomial function of temperature (equation 2). Using this equation, the estimate of the optimum temperature for C. acutatum is given by –b1/2b2. Based on the estimated parameters in Table 4, the optimum temperature for C. acutatum was predicted to be between 26 and 29°C, with one exception. Due to the limited number of temperatures tested, the estimated coefficients for other species are not reliable. In general, no clear differences among isolates or species were observed in the latent period around the optimum temperature. Although the estimated temperature optima for the latent period are not significantly different from one another, they are similar to the optimum for infection (35). However, there was a trend indicating that these temperature values tend to be slightly higher than the estimated optima for sporulation identified here.
The results from this study, along with previous research, may explain the increasing significance of C. acutatum in northern regions (15, 20). Once introduced in an area, C. acutatum could possess distinct advantages over other strawberry-infecting species of Colletotrichum at cooler temperatures, which are typical for northern climates. Two of these advantages include a shorter latent period for C. acutatum and a greater production of spores at lower temperatures.
