The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.
To achieve successful pathogenicity, fungi employ various infection strategies to breach the host cuticle. Some pathogens utilize mechanical means through specialized infection structures, while others penetrate the cuticle directly with the assistance of extracellular cutinase activity. Colletotrichum truncatum, a pathogen of legumes, cereals, grasses, and vegetable crops such as Capsicum species, is an ascomycete that infects its host through direct penetration of the host cuticle. The infection and penetration process is believed to be triggered by cutin-degrading enzymes such as cutinase. Numerous cutinases have been isolated and characterized from different fungi. These enzymes are suggested to play roles in carbon acquisition for saprophytic growth, as well as in fungal penetration and surface adhesion.
Cutinase has been proposed as the hydrolyzing agent of the plant cuticle and/or an elicitor of cutin monomers, which trigger signaling pathways within fungal pathogens. Despite the identification of cutinase in various Colletotrichum species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. trifolii, C. lagenarium, and C. capsici, the characterization of the gene and its function in the C. truncatum-chili interaction remains unexplored.
Traditionally, gene function analysis has been conducted using conventional methods, examining phenotypic or biochemical changes in response to mutations of the gene of interest. However, this process can be laborious and time-consuming. Additionally, the wealth of information from the increasing sequencing of fungal genomes necessitates a more efficient method to link genetic information to biological function accurately. This has led to the development of alternative methods such as RNA-mediated gene silencing.
RNA-mediated gene silencing is a powerful tool for functional gene analysis. Initially discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, this strategy has now been applied to various organisms across different kingdoms. Known as Post-Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS) in plants, RNA interference (RNAi) in animals, and quelling in fungi, this phenomenon utilizes the endogenous gene regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic cells. Double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved by a nuclease (Dicer) from the RNase III family into smaller interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21 to 28 nucleotides in length, which are then incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex, forming the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). The RISC recognizes homologous mRNAs by complementary base pairing and triggers sequence-specific degradation of the homologous mRNA.
Studies on gene function through specific inhibition of pathogenicity or plant-fungal interaction gene expression using RNA-mediated gene silencing have been reported in many ascomycete fungi, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Magnaporthe oryzae, and Colletotrichum lagenarium. However, this silencing mechanism has not yet been employed in C. truncatum to understand its pathogenicity.
Colletotrichum truncatum pathotype F8-3B and its transformant expressing GFP, which causes anthracnose disease in chili (Capsicum spp.), were cultivated on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA; Difco Laboratories, France) at 24°C with a 12-hour photoperiod. The medium for the GFP-tagged F8-3B transformant was supplemented with 250 µg/ml of hygromycin B antibiotic. Conidiospores from 14-day-old cultures were adjusted to 10^6 conidiospores/ml for transformation experiments. Genomic DNA/RNA extraction was performed on fungal mycelium grown in 50 ml Czapek-Dox broth (CDB; Difco Laboratories, France) for 7 days under the same temperature and light conditions until a mycelial mat formed.
Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1, used as the donor for fungal transformation, was grown in Luria Bertani (LB) broth with 5 mM glucose (LBG; Sigma Aldrich, USA) at 28°C. One Shot TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen, Australia) served as the host for gene manipulation and was maintained in LB broth at 37°C.
For pathogenicity assays, Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang plants were grown in pots in a glasshouse under controlled conditions of light (18-hour photoperiod), temperature (28°C), and humidity (60-70%). One-month-old Glycine max genotype Bragg soybean plants were also maintained in the glasshouse.
Total RNA was extracted from saprophytic stage mycelium (growing in CDB) and pathogenic stage mycelium (2, 6, and 24 hours post-inoculation) using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Australia), following the manufacturer's instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA was removed from RNA samples using DNase I (Qiagen, Australia) treatment at room temperature for 30 minutes.
The integrity and quantity of total RNA were confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis alongside a 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder (Invitrogen, Australia). First-strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Omniscript RT-PCR Kit (Qiagen, Australia) with oligo-dT primer according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Gene transcript evaluation was conducted by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using Cut1F and Cut1R primers, designed based on orthologues of fungal cutinase. The GAPDH gene was used to normalize expression levels. Three replicates were conducted for the experiment.
Genomic DNA was extracted from fungal mycelium using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit (Qiagen, Australia) following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was performed to amplify the cutinase gene in C. truncatum F8-3B using gCUT-F and gCUT-R primers. The PCR reaction comprised 20 ng genomic DNA, 250 µM dNTPs, 0.5 µM of each primer, 1.5 mM MgCl2, PCR buffer, and 0.5 U Taq DNA Polymerase (Scientifix, Australia) in a total volume of 25 µl. Amplification conditions included an initial denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 94°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 60°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, concluding with a final elongation at 72°C for 5 minutes to ensure full extension of any remaining single-stranded DNA. The PCR reaction was conducted in a PTC-100 Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc, USA). Both cDNA and genomic DNA-derived PCR products were cloned and sequenced (AGRF, Australia).

Table 1: List of primers used in the study.
Bioinformatics tools were used to analyze and confirm the cloned gene, designated as CtCut1. The protein prediction/manipulation tools in the Gene Infinity program (http://www.geneinfinity.org/) were utilized to predict the cutinase protein's molecular weight and isoelectric point.
Two binary vectors, designated as pJF1_ShhGFP and pAA1, were created for RNA-mediated gene silencing. The sGFP cassette driven by the ToxA promoter from the pJF1 plasmid was removed by digestion at the HindIII-EcoRI site, resulting in an open plasmid for cloning the desired fragment. A 1354-bp DNA fragment containing regulatory sequences, along with the sense and antisense of GFP interrupted by the C. truncatum cutinase (Accession number HQ406775) intron to form a hairpin structure, was synthesized and cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI digested site of pJF1, producing the pJF1_ShhGFP fungal silencing plasmid (DNA2.0, USA). The second fungal silencing vector, pAA1, was constructed by cloning the sense and antisense strands of the cutinase cDNA into SmaI-XhoI and BamHI-XbaI sites of the pJF1_ShhGFP plasmid. The internal cutinase fragment (from 17 bp to 532 bp) was amplified with primers SmaI-CutS-F and XbaI-CutS-R to generate the sense (540 bp) and with primers BamHI-CutAS-F and XhoI-CutAS-R to generate the antisense (541 bp). Amplifications were performed in two separate reactions using 20 ng/µl C. truncatum cutinase DNA previously cloned into the pCRfi4-TOPOfi vector (Invitrogen, Australia) as a template.
The amplified antisense fragment was digested with SmaI and XbaI, while the sense fragment was digested with BamHI and XhoI to generate the pAA1 cassette (2386 bp).

Restriction enzyme sites are indicated as follows: H for HindIII, S for SmaI, Xb for XbaI, B for BamHI, and E for EcoRI. The nucleotide sequence of the cutinase gene is available from the NCBI database (Accession no. HQ406775). b) Plasmid map of pAA1.
Hybridization of bound fragments was conducted at 42°C for 1.5 hours and overnight, respectively. The blot was washed and further processed following the DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit II protocol. The number of bands that appeared on the blot indicated the number of copies of the 540 bp cutinase probe, which also represented the number of copies of the cutinase genes in the genome. Wild-type C. truncatum genomic DNA and the pAA1 plasmid were used as controls.
For the quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis, fourteen-day-old germinated conidiospore transformants expressing GFP were transformed with pJF1_ShhGFP and its wild type. The mycelium of 7-day-old F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F2, F4, F5, F7, and F8) was transformed with pAA1 by the ATMT method, as described by Chen et al. [30]. Both pJF1_ShhGFP and pAA1 transformed strains were selected on PDA containing 250 µg/ml hygromycin B antibiotic. After 6 hours, the inoculated fungal mycelium was collected, freeze-dried, and subjected to RNA extraction and cDNA conversion. Wild-type F8-3B was used as the control. The transcript levels of CtCut1, which encodes for the cutinase gene of C. truncatum, were quantified in five transformants in response to gene knockdown.
The reactions were performed with ABI qPCR universal master mix (Applied Biosystems, USA) using an ABI-Applied Biosystems 7900 HT Real-Time PCR machine by MCLAB, USA. Triplicate qRT-PCR reactions were conducted for all biological replicates. Elongation Factor 1 (EF1) from wild-type C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B was used as a reference gene for the qRT-PCR experiment due to its stability across diverse developmental stages [40]. The analysis of qRT-PCR data was performed using the comparative delta Ct (∆Ct) method [41]. Two independent experiments were performed, with three technical replicates each. Results from these experiments were statistically analyzed using ANOVA.
In the pathogenicity bioassays, the fruit of C. annuum genotype Bangchang, which is susceptible to C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B [31], was used. Leaves of G. max genotype Bragg, a susceptible leguminous host of C. truncatum [42], were alternately used to verify the infection characteristics of the fungus. Successful transformants were identified by the absence of GFP expression. For this assessment, all specimens were placed on a glass slide in a water droplet, covered with a cover slip, and observed under a microscope. Images were captured using a Leica DC300F digital camera with Leica IM50 v.4 software. Wild-type F8-3B and transformants expressing GFP [30] were used as controls.
PCR was used to confirm the presence of T-DNA in ten putative transformants (F1, F2.1, F2.2, F4, F5.1, F5.2, F7, F8, F9, and F10). Leaves intended for pathogenicity assays were surface sterilized with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite (NaOCl) for 5 minutes, followed by several rinses with sterile distilled water before fungal inoculation. An internal 544 bp region of the hph gene was amplified using hphF and hphR primers (see Table 1). Putative transformants F2.1, F2.2, F5.1, and F5.2 were derived from separate single spores of the same transformation event for each isolate, respectively.
A preliminary non-wound chili fruit bioassay was conducted on detached Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang fruit. Agar plugs from 8-day-old cultures, consisting of actively growing mycelium from transformed strains (F1, F2, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F10) and a wild type, were excised using a cork borer and placed onto the surface-sterilized fruit. Another PCR was performed with the 207 bp region of the sgfp gene using the primers SmaI-CutS-F and S-GFP-R (see Table 1).
Southern blot analysis was conducted to confirm the copy number of the endogenous cutinase gene in the wild type and the integration of T-DNA containing the hairpin cassette in the transformed fungal genome. Transformed fungal genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction method that utilizes high SDS concentration. A total of 8 µg of genomic DNA was digested with 20 U of HindIII (New England Biolabs, UK) at 37°C for 8 hours. The pAA1 plasmid was prepared using HindIII and EcoRI restriction enzymes. Fragments were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane (Roche Diagnostics Cooperation, Indianapolis, USA). A 540-bp cutinase probe was generated by PCR using the SmaI-CutS-F and XbaI-CutS-R primers (see Table 1), labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) according to the DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit II protocol (Roche Diagnostics GmBH, Germany).
Subsequent pathogenicity bioassays were carried out using a wild type and two or three F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F2, F4, and F8), comparing wound versus non-wound inoculation methods. Wound inoculation of the detached chili fruit involved pricking the surface to penetrate the cuticle to a depth of 1 to 2 mm with a sterile needle, then placing agar plugs of actively growing mycelium from 14 to 21-day-old cultures of transformed strains and a wild type over the wound site. Fruits were placed in a plastic box on a tray containing 900 ml of water, sealed to provide humidity, and incubated at 28°C with a 12-hour photoperiod. Three fruit replicates for each treatment were used, and the experiment was replicated twice.
Table Description: The text references a table that includes primer details used for PCR amplification of specific gene regions (hph and sgfp). The table likely lists the primer names, sequences, and the sizes of the amplified products, aiding in the verification of successful gene integration in the transformed fungal strains.
Soybean is a highly susceptible host to Colletotrichum truncatum, and inoculated leaves exhibited infection within three days (unpublished data). To assess the degree of infection caused by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F1, F2, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, and F10), leaves from the G. max genotype Bragg were used. Detached leaves from one-month-old soybean plants were surface sterilized and placed on moist filter paper discs in Petri dishes. Agar plugs containing actively growing mycelium of the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants were inoculated onto the left corner of the abaxial surface of the detached leaves. The wild-type strain F8-3B, designated as FW, was inoculated onto the right corner of the abaxial surface of the same leaves as a control. The inoculated leaves were incubated at 28°C with 95% relative humidity in a 12-hour photoperiod. Anthracnose symptoms, characterized by sunken and water-soaked tissue developing around the fungal plug on the leaves, were evaluated at five days after inoculation (DAI). Disease severity caused by the transformed strains was measured based on the percentage of the lesion diameter relative to the wild type. Pathogenicity of the transformants was considered retained if the lesion diameter was similar to that of the wild type. The experiment was conducted with two leaves, with each leaf containing two replicates of the transformants and one of the wild type. This experiment was repeated twice, and the results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA.
The sterilized abaxial surface of detached young leaves from the Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang was placed on moist filter paper discs in Petri dishes. These were inoculated with 10 µl of 2 × 10^6 conidiospores/ml of F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F2, F4, F5, F7, and F8). At least two leaves were used per fungal sample, and three positions on the abaxial leaf surface (basal end, midrib, and tip end) were inoculated. The wild-type strain F8-3B served as a control (designated as FW). The Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated at 28°C with a 12-hour photoperiod. Two time points—6 hours and 24 hours after inoculation (HAI)—were selected to determine the optimal timing for counting germ tube and appressoria structures.
Inoculated tissue samples were excised into 1 cm² leaf pieces and placed in an acetic alcohol solution (absolute ethanol: glacial acetic acid, 1:2) for 24 to 48 hours, following the method by Khan and Hsiang [43] to remove chlorophyll. The acetic alcohol solution was replaced when it turned dark green. Cleared tissues were then rinsed with sterile distilled water, placed on glass slides with the abaxial surface facing up, and examined under a Leica DMRBE microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany) in drops of 0.05% trypan blue (w/v). Images were captured using a Leica DC300F digital camera with Leica IM50 v.4 software.
Each leaf tissue was treated as a separate replicate. A random selection of three out of the six replicates was made per fungal sample. A total of 100 conidiospores per tissue were observed for germination and appressoria formation. Conidiospores were considered germinated when germ tubes were present, regardless of their length. The presence of a globular structure, either at the conidiospore or at the end of the germ tube, with a diameter larger than that of the germ tube was classified as an appressorium and counted [44]. Results from the experiments were statistically analyzed using ANOVA.
A 1936-bp cutinase genomic DNA fragment from Colletotrichum truncatum pathotype F8-3B was obtained and designated as CtCut1. The primer binding sites of the sequence were identified. The predicted molecular weight for CtCut1 DNA was 1196.35 kDa. The nucleotide sequence contained portions identical to the partial gene obtained previously from RT-PCR results (data not shown). Sequence analysis of the gene revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 684 nucleotides with a stop codon (TGA), interrupted by a single 57-bp intron. The predicted ORF encoded a polypeptide of 228 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 23.81 kDa and a predicted protein isoelectric point (pI) of 7.82. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences showed significant 99% identity to the cutinase of C. capsici isolated from papaya, and 85% and 84% identity to G. cingulata and C. gloeosporioides, respectively.
Following a bioinformatics assessment, CtCut1 DNA was submitted to the NCBI GenBank database and attributed the accession number HQ406775.
Figure 2 shows the pattern of C. truncatum cutinase gene transcripts expressed during the early stages of chili infection. The numbers on top of the agarose gel lanes denote the hours after inoculation (HAI) of the fungal mycelium on the host under laboratory conditions. The GAPDH gene was used to normalize the expression levels, and total RNA was used to demonstrate equal loading for cDNA conversion. M denotes the 1 kb Plus DNA marker.
Figure 3 illustrates the nucleotide sequence of a cloned genomic DNA for the Colletotrichum truncatum isolate F8-3B CtCut1 gene (accession no. HQ406775). The deduced amino acid sequence is shown above the open reading frame. The untranslated sequence gap beginning at nucleotide 868 is a 57-bp intron. The CAAT and TAAATA boxes for transcription, as well as the potential polyadenylation site (TAAA), are underlined. The three potential AATs are italicized. The ‘*’ indicates the stop codon of the ORF (represented by the amino acid sequences), while ‘˚’ represents the false stop codon in the intron region. Translation was carried out using SIXFRAME (Biology Workbench 3.2, University of California San Diego, 1999). Primer sites used to amplify the gene are shaded in grey. The bolded nucleotide sequence was used as a probe in Southern analysis. The cutinase cDNA fragment was also used to generate the hairpin transcriptional unit for RNAi silencing.
All C. truncatum transformed strains were able to grow on the hygromycin selective medium. The phenotypes of the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and the wild type (FW) were indistinguishable with respect to colony morphology, growth rate, and conidiospore production. The unique feature of the fungus, characterized by the formation of concentric rings during sporulation, was exhibited in all individuals. The conidiospores and hyphae of F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and wild type samples did not fluoresce under the GFP filter, indicating that the silencing construct had been integrated into the genome and was functioning efficiently.
Single-spore-derived F8-3B-pAA1 transformed strains were subjected to PCR analysis. The hph and sGFP regions of T-DNA insertions were detected through amplification of the expected size fragments. All of the transformants amplified a 544-bp and a 207-bp fragment. Neither fragment was amplified from the wild type.
Southern blot analysis indicated that 85.7% of the fungal genomes contained the T-DNA insertion (Figure 4b). Restricted genomic DNA of seven F8-3B-pAA1 transformants, probed with a DIG-labeled 540 bp cutinase sense fragment, confirmed the integration of the hairpin structure into the genome of F8-3B-pAA1 transformants.
HindIII was expected to cut the T-DNA sequence only once. All the transformants tested contained one insert of the T-DNA, with the exception of transformant F5, which contained three copies, and transformants F4 and F9, which contained two copies of the T-DNA (Figure 4b). A higher molecular endogenous cutinase band was observed in transformant F4, suggesting the integration of T-DNA adjacent to the endogenous cutinase gene or the occurrence of partial T-DNA integration into the genome. However, transformant F10 did not exhibit any additional bands apart from the endogenous cutinase band (Figure 4b). Incidentally, this transformant was able to grow in the selective medium, suggesting the integration of a nicked T-DNA strand containing the hygromycin B resistant fragment into the fungal genome.
The wild-type copy of the endogenous cutinase gene, CtCut1, was visible in all genomes as a hybridizing band at approximately 8 kb (Figure 4b). As HindIII and EcoRI cut within the T-DNA insert and outside of the exogenous cutinase silencing transcriptional unit, a band of 2386 bp corresponding to the intact pAA1 cassette was expected and observed (Figure 4b). Undigested and/or partially digested pAA1 plasmid was also seen hybridizing at approximately 10 kb (Figure 4b).
Comparative CtCut1 transcription of 6 hours after infection (HAI) in C. truncatum mycelium from five F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and one wild type was determined using qRT-PCR. Differential expression of CtCut1, which encodes for the cutinase gene in C. truncatum, was detected from these transformants at 6 HAI (Figure 5). In the wild-type (FW) mycelium, the amount of CtCut1 transcript, when normalized to EF1 transcript, gave a relative expression value of 2.45 ± 0.11 SE compared with 1.33 ± 0.29 SE from the average of five transformants. These data indicated nearly a one-fold decrease in the relative expression of CtCut1 in F8-3B-pAA1 transformants during infection. The most significant decrease occurred in transformant F2, followed by F5, F8, and F4, with decreases in CtCut1 transcript of 72.0%, 52.7%, 45.1%, and 44.3%, respectively, in comparison to the expression in the wild type. In contrast, transformant F7 displayed no significant difference from the wild type, although a slight reduction in CtCut1 transcript (14.9%) was observed. Overall, F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited 54.2% of cutinase activity compared to the wild type.
In the preliminary pathogenicity bioassay with non-wounded detached chili fruit, all F8-3B-pAA1 transformants generally showed reduced or no infection compared to the wild type at 13 days after inoculation (DAI) (data not shown). In a subsequent detailed pathogenicity assay on wounded and non-wounded fruit, the transformed strains were found to be less aggressive on non-wounded fruit compared to the wild type at both 9 and 13 DAI (Table 2). Very little or no infection occurred in fruit up to 9 DAI for the transformed strains; however, by 13 DAI, symptoms of the disease were displayed at the site of the transformed inoculum (Figure 6), suggesting a delay in the transformants' ability to invade the host tissues. On wounded fruit, there was no difference in the severity of infection between wild type and transformed strains at 2 or 4 DAI (Table 2).
The table referenced (Table 2) likely presents data on the infection rates or severity of infection in various chili fruit treatments, including the wild type and different transformants (F2, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F10). It would typically show measurements such as percentage of infection or relative severity scores across different time points (e.g., 2 DAI, 4 DAI, 9 DAI, 13 DAI), allowing for a comparison between the transformed strains and the wild type.
The study examines the Southern analysis of hygromycin-resistant transformants, where genomic DNA (8 μg) was digested with HindIII and probed with a DIG-labelled 540 bp cutinase sense fragment. The closed triangle indicates the single-copy endogenous cutinase gene, hybridized at approximately 8.0 kb in the fungal genome. The open triangle represents the exogenous cutinase silencing transcriptional unit (2386 bp) within the T-DNA fragment. Non-transformed C. truncatum (FW) served as the negative control, while HindIII + EcoRI-digested pAA1 plasmid was utilized as the positive control. An arrow corresponds to the undigested plasmid.
In the study published in the Journal of Plant Pathology & Microbiology (Volume 6, Issue 3, Article 1000259), Auyong et al. (2015) explored the role of cutinase and its impact on the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum truncatum.
GFP fluorescence was not detected in any conidiospores isolated from infected fruits, neither in the wild type nor in the transformants (data not shown). Germinated conidia developed appressoria by 6 hours after inoculation (HAI) on the chili leaves of the C. annuum genotype Bangchang. At 6 HAI, the highest number of appressoria was formed in the wild type compared to the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants. However, no significant difference in germ tube length was observed between the wild type and the transformants, though the length of germ tubes with appressoria in the transformants was generally longer than in the wild type (data not shown).
In a soybean leaf bioassay, differences in the severity of infection were noted between the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and the wild type at 5 days after inoculation (DAI). The transformed strains were categorized into two levels of pathogenicity: high (transformants F2, F5, and F8) and low (transformants F1, F4, F7, F9, and F10), indicating a reduction in infection efficiency. This was clearly illustrated by the varying degrees of anthracnose symptoms in the in planta soybean bioassay. The lesion regions on soybean leaves demonstrated that transformants with reduced expression of the cutinase gene (F2, F5, and F8) exhibited lower pathogenicity compared to the wild type.
A full-length gene encoding cutinase, CtCut1, from C. truncatum was successfully isolated and characterized. The amino acid sequence predicted from the nucleotide sequence showed a high degree of homology to cutinases from other fungi in the Colletotrichum genus, as well as other ascomycetes. The presence of the GYSQG motif, known to be a signature pattern for cutinase genes, was also confirmed in CtCut1.
Table Description: Table 2 provides consensus ratings of disease severity based on the scale proposed by Montri et al. It compares the severity of infections caused by both pAA1-transformed and wild type Colletotrichum truncatum on Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang. The table lists various categories of disease severity, showing how the transformed strains and the wild type differ in terms of their impact on the plants. It emphasizes the significance of cutinase gene expression levels in determining pathogenicity, with marked differences in disease severity ratings reflecting the performance of the different transformants.
Wild type and transformed Colletotrichum truncatum pathotype F8-3B were studied on Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang. The fruit surface of non-wounded chili was inoculated with 14-day-old C. truncatum transformants F2, F4, and F8. The wild type (FW) was used as the control. The samples were taken from Bangchang leaves 6 hours after inoculation (HAI). Different letters above the transformants indicated significant differences based on analysis of variance (ANOVA). The scores next to the infected fruit indicated the area of anthracnose sunken lesions. The least significant difference (LSD) was calculated at p<0.05 (n=3).
The study, published in the Journal of Plant Pathology and Microbiology (ISSN: 2157-7471, Volume 6, Issue 3), examined the role of cutinase and its impact on the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum truncatum (Auyong et al., 2015, doi:10.4172/2157-7471.1000259). It was likely that the only gene affected by the pAA1 hairpin was CtCut1. The pAA1 plasmid was versatile, containing restriction enzyme sites that facilitated the creation of a hairpin cassette for silencing any gene, provided the primers used were designed with compatible restriction enzyme sites. The success of this silencing was predicted to be partially enhanced by the relatively short 57-bp intron sequence in the pAA1 plasmid, as short intron sequences have been reported to provide stable and high silencing frequencies in Magnaporthe oryzae, sometimes leading to complete silenced phenotypes.
The intron sequence used to form the hairpin in the pAA1 plasmid derived from the cutinase gene of C. truncatum, which likely reduced the possibility of organism rejection. Proper regulation of RNA-silencing machinery, enabling high levels of gene silencing, was anticipated. In contrast, Praveen et al. reported that the use of intron sequences from non-related organisms might yield lower gene silencing efficacy.
Despite limited detailed genome information of C. truncatum and partial integration of T-DNA observed in transformant F10, the RNAi approach produced silenced transformants to some degree, which is usually sufficient for practical use. There were fewer challenges in the inactivation of the gene, such as the need to identify the number of copies or members of the gene in the genome. The flexibility of RNA-mediated gene silencing to simultaneously silence homologous genes was achievable in C. truncatum due to the specific nature of CtCut1 gene suppression.
In the soybean pathogenicity bioassay, the efficiency of infection was determined for C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B pAA1 transformants, lacking cutinase, five days after inoculation (DAI). Cutinase silenced transformants exhibited different percentages of reduction in infection efficiency on soybean leaves. The mean percentage of infection reduction was normalized against the wild type, with different letters above the bars indicating significant differences based on the analysis.
Colletotrichum truncatum has a single copy of the cutinase gene in its genome. The presence of a triad consisting of aspartic acid (Asp), serine (Ser), and histidine (His), along with an essential carboxyl group, likely corresponds to the single cutinase gene found within the cloned CtCut1. This structure resembles those of cutinases from other members of the pathogen. Additionally, there have been reports indicating divergence in the cutinase gene among other Colletotrichum species [5, 45, 48, 52].
In contrast, Skamnioti et al. [53] reported the existence of multiple cutinase families in Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium graminearum, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa. They achieved RNA-mediated gene silencing in C. truncatum using a hairpin plasmid, specifically pAA1, which incorporated a short fragment of sGFP along with CtCut1 as the silencing target. This method allowed for variable but efficient knockdown of the cutinase gene in C. truncatum.
The pAA1 plasmid was stably transformed into C. truncatum through Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, effectively suppressing the entire gene family (homologous genes) and avoiding gene compensation issues. Baulcombe [54] demonstrated that co-suppression of gene families occurred during the disruption of the quelling defective (qde-1) gene mutation, resulting in silencing of a tomato RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue in N. crassa. The incorporation of the hairpin cassette into the fungal genome activated the endogenous RNA interference machinery within the pathogen, leading to the silencing of homologues as seen with the OsRac gene in Oryza sativa.
In addition, the transformed strains exhibited resilience through multiple rounds of subculture on selective media, indicating stable integration of the pAA1 cassette into the genomes of all transformed strains of C. truncatum. Southern blot analysis confirmed this ectopic integration. Interestingly, the hairpin construct that initiated the gene silencing of CtCut1 resulted in minimal off-target effects in C. truncatum, despite the number of T-DNA copies harboring the pAA1 cassette in the genome. A notable reduction in the mRNA levels of CtCut1 (ranging from 14.9% to 72%) was observed across the transformed strains, with no significant changes in morphology, growth rate, or conidiospore production. Such variability among transformants using this technique has been reported in other fungal studies.
The infection and colonization by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants on detached chili and soybean hosts were less efficient compared to the wild-type F8-3B, further suggesting the involvement of the gene during pathogenesis. Transformed strains were unable to infect normally, and there was a delay in infection, as indicated by the extremely slow development of anthracnose symptoms on chili fruits. It is suggested that direct penetration through the host cuticle during the infection process of C. truncatum was largely governed by the presence of cutinase in the fungus.
In contrast, there was no difference in infection and colonization by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and the wild type on wounded fruit, suggesting that cutinase no longer played an important role in cell infection after the cuticle was penetrated. Hence, there was no disadvantage to the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants having reduced expression of cutinase once they had infected the pericarp tissue. These results were consistent with previously reported work demonstrating that the C. capsici pathotype F8-3B was able to infect chili fruits when wound inoculation was applied. If the hypothesis is that cutinase assists with the penetration of the fungal pathogen, then the wound inoculation method is unlikely to demonstrate the function of the gene since the host's first layer of defense (cuticle and epidermis) has been disrupted.
The reduced level of cutinase expression in the transformants may have interrupted or delayed pathogen recognition of the host surface, resulting in the formation of a lower number of appressoria. Cutinase may be required to stimulate a host reaction, which is then recognized by the pathogen to initiate appressoria formation and penetration. Therefore, the inability of the pathogen to express the effector (cutinase) may have led to poor infection rates. Deising et al. reported that cutinase was involved in the adhesion of Uromyces viciae uredospores to the host cuticle. In another report, Woloshuk and Kolattukudy indicated that the expression of cutinase from spores of Fusarium solani was triggered upon contact with the plant cuticle. Indeed, Li et al. reported that low levels of cutinase present in the saprophytic phase of F. pisi f. sp. pisi were essential to induce higher levels of cutinase expression during infection of the fungus to penetrate its host. Since the endogenous cutinase in these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants was suppressed, the regulation of normal cutinase activity was affected. Whether this abnormal regulation of cutinase activity occurred due to its inability to secrete sufficient levels of cutinase initially to induce cutin monomers from the host or from a failure of the pathogen to detect the host cutin monomers remains unknown.
The soybean pathogenicity bioassay revealed varying levels of soybean leaf infection when inoculated with various selected F8-3B-pAA1 transformants. These observations confirmed that the disturbance of the CtCut1 gene via RNA-mediated gene silencing (knockdown) altered the pathogenicity of the transformants. Indeed, the relative expression of the five selected F8-3B-pAA1 transformants showed different levels of CtCut1 transcription compared to the control wild type in the qRT-PCR assay. Lower levels of CtCut1 transcripts translated to reduced infection. Similar observations were noted in the Pyrenopeziza brassicae-Brassica napus system, where mutants lacking cutinase transcript expression failed to penetrate.
Taken together, these results demonstrate that the pAA1 plasmid is efficient and applicable for inducing gene silencing in most genes and Colletotrichum species. The observation indicated that the silencing of the cutinase gene may have altered the pathogenicity of the transformants. More durable and novel forms of disease control can be implemented when knowledge of the pathogenicity genes that trigger resistance is made available through this alternative genetic tool approach.
