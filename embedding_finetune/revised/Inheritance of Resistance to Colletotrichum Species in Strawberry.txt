Bimodal distributions were observed in both experiments (Fig. 1), suggesting major gene action. The large amount of within-family variance not accounted for probably indicates epistatic effects. The underestimation of genetic variance could inflate results, but the similar estimates of 1.33 and 1.61 using different genotypes and isolates in different years do not suggest such a bias. Wright (1956) hypothesized that large epistatic effects would be expected when biparental crosses are made in species that are normally propagated asexually. Epistatic variance was important for various commercial traits in studies conducted by Comstock et al. (1958), Hansche et al. (1968), Watkins and Spangelo (1968), Watkins et al. (1970), and Spangelo et al. (1971), suggesting that it is a general phenomenon in strawberries. While epistatic effects are important, those postulated in this study occurred within families and should not affect other variances computed from among-family comparisons (Shaw et al., 1989).
The validity of other assumptions under which additive and dominance variances are estimated appears reasonable to accept, although some remain uncertain: 1) Regular diploid behavior of octoploid strawberries at meiosis was found by Powers (1944) and Arulsekar et al. (1981). 2) The presence of minimal cytoplasmic or other maternal effects is supported by the fact that genetic variance was relatively large; however, it would have been underestimated if such effects were considerable (Comstock et al., 1958). 3) The assumption of no correlation of genotypes at different loci may not be tenable in Experiment 1 but probably is in Experiment 2, as the parents constitute broadly based germplasm. The parents were related in some instances; nevertheless, they represent a random sample of the population of interest.
The high proportion of dominance variance in Experiment 2 compared with Experiment 1 may be attributed to the broad-based, more representative strawberry population sample in the former. The variance estimates for instances were 0.10 and 0.17, while for another measure, the estimates were 0.67 and 0.63. These results illustrate the potential erroneous conclusions that can arise from using too few parents. Assuming that epistasis is important, the within-family variance not accounted for equaled 35% and 38% of the total genetic variance in females and males, respectively, which could inflate genetic variance estimates (Hallaeur and Miranda, 1981). Nevertheless, gains from selection of clonal value should be feasible due to the high estimate of broad-sense heritability. The high proportion of total genetic variance estimated to consist of epistatic variance suggests that broad-sense heritability estimates (0.85 for males and 0.87 for females) were very high.
A difference between the mean disease severity ratings of Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae in both experiments confirmed previous findings (Smith and Black, 1990) that C. acutatum produces less severe plant disease reactions than C. fragariae. Colletotrichum acutatum is occasionally isolated from the crowns of dying plants in the field, but it primarily acts as a fruit rot organism with the potential to cause crown rot.
The lack of significant genotype × isolate variance in both experiments suggested a similar genetic response to C. fragariae and C. acutatum. This finding aligns with Smith and Black (1990), who noted that most cultivars responded similarly.
The Colletotrichum spp. and the race in question should probably be identified before initiating a breeding program, even though no genotype × isolate interaction was indicated in this study. The frequency of plants inoculated with Colletotrichum fragariae isolates CF-63, LA-1, and Fla-1, along with C. acutatum isolate Goff in Experiment 1, and C. fragariae isolates CF-63 and MS-9, as well as C. acutatum isolate Mil-1 in Experiment 2, suggests that a multistage selection/breeding procedure would be efficient.
Within-family selection would allow for the introgression of new germplasm to introduce desirable characteristics and reduce inbreeding. Establishing a broad genetic population resistant to Colletotrichum spp. from which selections could be evaluated (using broad-sense heritability) and/or recombined to produce improved populations also appears feasible. Narrow-sense heritability estimates based on this study are likely sufficient to produce moderate gains from recurrent selection. This conclusion is supported by the observation of increased levels of resistance with successive cycles of selection following phenotypic assortative mating (B.J.S., unpublished data).
