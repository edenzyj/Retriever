Seven species of Colletotrichum known to cause ripe fruit rots in Queensland are compared regarding spore measurements, cultural characteristics, temperature reactions, and host range, determined by field collection and artificial inoculation. The characteristic features of these organisms are discussed, and it is concluded that it is necessary to designate a new form of C. gloeosporioides and one new species. Ripe fruit rots are a common source of loss in Queensland, particularly in tropical and subtropical fruits. Among the pathogens associated, species of the genus Colletotrichum are by far the most prevalent. Members of this group are particularly suited to this type of activity, and their ability to maintain a saprophytic existence on decaying host parts ensures a reliable source of inoculum. Additionally, by forming latent infections throughout the fruit's growing period, the parasite becomes largely independent of environmental conditions during ripening, not to mention the protection it gains from fungicides. Several distinct species of Colletotrichum are associated with ripe fruit rots in Queensland, and multiple species may be responsible for similar diseases on a single fruit variety. This paper attempts to categorize these species correctly while summarizing their main characteristics. It is hoped that the information presented will aid future determinations and enhance the understanding of the importance of individual diseases.

Taxonomy within the genus Colletotrichum has long been unsatisfactory, with many poorly defined species. Arx (1957a, 1957b) endeavored to clarify the position. While this work has led to a useful simplification and highlighted the need for a significant reduction in the number of species, it is inevitable that among the synonyms listed by Arx, some species or groups will warrant separate status upon further investigation. This has been confirmed in the present work, where a previously described variety has been used to designate one such group. The following species are discussed: Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, stat. conid.; Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz.; G. cingulata var. minor Wr., stat. conid.; C. gloeosporioides var. minor var. nov.; C. musae (Berk. & Curt.) Arx (Gloeosporium musarum Cke. & Mass.); Colletotrichum atramentarium (Berk. & Br.) Taubenh.; C. dematium (Pers. ex Fr.) Grove; C. orbiculare (Berk. & Mont.) Arx; C. acutatum sp. nov. With the introduction of a variety, the original species G. cingulata should strictly be referred to as G. cingulata var. cingulata. However, in this paper, reference to this species as originally understood has been made by simply omitting a varietal name when confusion is unlikely to occur.
Imperfect Stage: For many species of Colletotrichum, reliance must be placed on conidial measurements, as the perfect stage occurs rarely or not at all. With spores as small and indistinct as those of Colletotrichum, even minor differences, while valid, are often difficult to demonstrate. Due to individual variability, overlapping between species is inevitable. As noted by Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949), extreme values are of limited use when comparing spore measurements of Colletotrichum species unless accompanied by the mean, as the range is typically too broad to effectively delimit species. This is why many older descriptions are challenging to interpret.
In Table 1, extremes have been replaced by the range of mean values for different collections or isolations. These individual means are based on the measurement of 15 spores in each case.
The table lists seven species of Colletotrichum, detailing the conidial measurements in micrometers (µm) as well as the general mean descriptions of the cultures. The measurements include ranges for length and width, with specific averages provided for each species. For example, C. gloeosporioides has a range of means from 11.9 to 17.0 by 3.6 to 5.8 µm, with a general mean of 13.8 by 4.8 µm. The descriptions provide insights into the morphology of the spores, such as whether they are oblong, slender, or crescent-shaped, highlighting distinctive features that aid in species recognition.
The general shape of the spore is often sufficiently distinctive for specific identification once familiarity is established. The chief distinguishing features are included in Table 1 and illustrated in Figure 1. Confusion can arise between the narrower strains of C. gloeosporioides and the broader strains of C. gloeosporioides var. minor, necessitating consideration of cultural characteristics for accurate classification. The restrictive host range of C. musae helps to prevent confusion with these two species.
Fig. 1 illustrates the conidia of various Colletotrichum species, showcasing their morphological differences.
Statistical significance at the 1% level was observed with A and B being significantly greater than C, and A being greater than B.
Perfect Stage: The perfect stage, Glomerella cingulata, represents the perithecial stage of C. gloeosporioides, which frequently occurs both on host plants and in culture. On papaya, lesions can often be identified macroscopically, leading to either perithecial or conidial isolates. Rarely, perithecia of G. cingulata var. minor have been observed, typically only in culture. The two forms of ascospores are similar in appearance, with the primary distinction being their size. Both ascospores are faintly brown and contain poorly staining contents. Measurements were restricted to this type, with ascospore measurements detailed in Table 3 and an analytical comparison provided in Table 4.
The analytical comparison of ascospores between G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor shows that both have significant differences in means, with a standard error of differences calculated.
Cultural Characters: Cultural studies have primarily utilized potato dextrose agar medium in petri dish cultures. Although various other media were explored, they did not significantly reduce existing variations. Tube cultures have often proven unsatisfactory for observing essential differences. Cultural characteristics can change considerably over time and through subculturing; hence, working with fresh isolates is recommended.
Over the course of this study, hundreds of isolates have been examined. Most conform to specific group characteristics with enough consistency for reasonable classification. However, some isolates are challenging to classify, and the lack of spore formation in many cases hampers identity verification. These unusual forms are not included in the following descriptions.
Examination of isolates has occurred intermittently over the past 15 years, suggesting that in cases of C. gloeosporioides and its variety minor, certain periods have been marked by a particular cultural type. It would be imprudent to designate any of these as the normal form, as both organisms exhibit significant variability in cultural appearance, distinguishing them from other fruit-rotting species studied.
Glomerella cingulata, stat. conid., and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, specifically G. cingulata var. cingulata, is a fast-growing species. Field isolations yield perithecial, conidial, and sterile cultures.
Colletotrichum species can be distinguished by their spicuously protruding structures from the surface, which are not embedded in the mycelium as seen in var. minor. Smaller, scattered, sooty perithecial elements may also be present. Mature ascospores are typically available from these cultures (Figure 2).
Figure 2 shows the plus and minus types of Glomerella cingulata (right-hand plate) and G. cingulata var. minor (left-hand plate) after 15 and 11 days of growth on P.D.A., respectively.
Conidial and Sterile Forms: Aerial mycelium appears fine, with low elevation and generally dense. From above, the color ranges from white to light grey, potentially appearing darker against a dark substratum beneath. In this latter case, the margin is usually white or pinkish. Viewed from below, the substrate may be light or dark in the center, with a light-colored or pinkish margin (Figure 3).
Figure 3 presents the following: (A left) Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor; (A right) C. acutatum; (B left) Glomerella cingulata minus type; (B right) G. cingulata sterile type, all after 10 days of growth on P.D.A.
A specific type commonly isolated from passion fruit exhibits low, fairly compact, white aerial mycelium with conspicuous black bodies scattered across it. These structures may bear conidia and function as sporodochia. In general, conidial production in culture is usually scarce or nonexistent.
Glomerella cingulata var. minor, categorized as C. gloeosporioides var. minor, is a fast-growing species with distinctly coarser mycelium compared to G. cingulata var. cingulata. Field isolations primarily yield conidial or sterile types. The aerial mycelium in these types is cottony or woolly, typically abundant and well elevated from the medium's surface, contrasting with the previously described variety. The coloration is usually white or varying shades of grey, while the substrate appears white to cream or varying densities of greyish olive or olive from below. Occasionally, forms with less abundant and elevated aerial mycelium emerge, which can be challenging to differentiate from the more elevated cultural types of C. gloeosporioides, unless conidia are present (as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3).
Conidia production is generally more common and abundant than in C. gloeosporioides. This may manifest as conidia scattered throughout the mycelium, imparting a pinkish hue to the culture, or as pink masses formed in acervuli or associated with black sporodochia-like bodies. On rare occasions when perithecia of G. cingulata var. minor appear in culture, they resemble the grey cottony conidial or sterile forms commonly obtained from field isolations rather than being of a distinct type. Large glomerate bodies, if present, are less numerous and less conspicuous, as they are often obscured by the mycelium. Small sooty perithecial elements may accompany the glomerate bodies or occur alone (Figure 2).
Colletotrichum musae (formerly Gloeosporium musarum) was extensively discussed by Simmonds and Mitchell (1940). Although three cultural types are recognized, the normal form is the one typically obtained from field isolations, characterized by a uniform appearance for the species. The aerial mycelium is white to light grey, loose, and not significantly elevated. Spores are produced early and abundantly directly on the mycelium or on acervuli that develop over the medium's surface, giving the colony a distinctive pink appearance.
The surface of the culture is initially white but develops a greyish aggregated overlay after a few days, resulting in a final color of grey or greyish-brown. This overlay may sometimes have a crystalline appearance. Below the substrate, the color is white or cream, occasionally featuring a creamy pink diffusion. If darker patches are present, they tend to be irregular. Recently, a series of isolates from papaya displayed a bright pink coloration overall, though other characteristics remained normal. The production of conidia in this species is notably abundant and is distributed throughout the mycelium, although conidiophores may cluster in structures resembling acervuli. Superficial spore masses typical of C. gloeosporioides var. minor are less frequently observed. Salmon-colored spore masses can sometimes be seen from below the media, although they are not obvious from above. The spore colors of C. gloeosporioides var. minor and C. acutatum differ slightly, with the former tending towards pink and the latter towards salmon. In inoculation tests on papaya, the spores of C. gloeosporioides var. minor were identified as bitter-sweet pink according to Ridgway's "Colour Standards and Nomenclature," while those of C. acutatum were referred to as capucine orange.
Colletotrichum orbiculare shows characteristically slow growth. Upon isolation, the aerial mycelium is typically fine, scanty, and low in elevation, sometimes appearing almost powdery. The color usually starts as pinkish, progressing to grey or dark grey in the center, with a pinkish margin that may have a submerged edge. From below, the substratum appears dark in the center with a broad cream or pinkish margin. With subculturing, the pink color tends to fade, leading to a more compact, grey growth that resembles types developed by other species. Fresh isolations often produce small pink spore masses scattered across the surface.
Colletotrichum atramentarium, when isolated from tomatoes, exhibits fine, scanty aerial mycelium that remains close to the surface, with a general color of white to pale pink. A well-defined black speckling develops from the center due to the formation of sclerotial bodies characteristic of this species. The substrate appears speckled grey in the center with a pinkish margin. With subculturing, the pinkish hue tends to disappear, replaced by denser sectors of grey mycelium. If the sclerotium-forming trait is lost, the culture's appearance may become indistinguishable from that of other species.
Colletotrichum dematium presents fine, white or grey aerial mycelium that is somewhat scanty; in some isolates, it is more abundant and moderately elevated. Typically, the color is darker in the center with a broad white margin. In fruiting cultures, the presence of setae can give the surface a finely tufted appearance. From below, the substratum appears dark grey or speckled grey with a white margin, and scattered dusky acervuli are present in fruiting cultures. The spore masses are usually straw-colored, but variations can occur.
Ascospore isolations have been made from Queensland G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor. Cultural types obtained from the former correlated fairly well with those described from Ipomoea, while those obtained from the latter resembled more closely the types described by Struble and Keitt from apple. A description of the Queensland types is provided below. The terminology used is, as far as correlation is possible, that of the authors cited above.
(a) Plus type: This is the same as previously described for the perithecial form of G. cingulata obtained from field isolations. It forms a definite perithecial line with minus types (Figure 2).
(b) Minus type: This type exhibits slight to scanty amounts of open, wispy, grey, or black aerial mycelium over a dark background. From below, the substrate appears dark olive to black, typically mottled but not always so. Numerous small, globular, immature, or occasionally mature perithecial elements are embedded in the surface. Conidia are usually scarce, but may occasionally be more plentiful. Minus types form a definite perithecial line with plus types. When used in artificial inoculation experiments, they are characteristically non-pathogenic (Figures 2 and 3).
(c) Sterile: Aerial mycelium is close, white, and appressed to the surface, forming a dense white mat without elevated hyphae. From below, the substrate is white, cream, or pinkish, sometimes developing grey or olive from the center, imparting a darker appearance to the surface view. The term "sterile" is chosen from the terms conidial and sterile used by Lucas, Chilton, and Edgerton (1944), as conidia are usually rare or absent and no perithecial line is formed with plus or minus types. It is not unusual for cultures of the sterile type to be obtained in field isolations (Figure 3).
(d) Yellow: Aerial mycelium is scanty and white on a light yellow background. The rate of growth is similar to that of other forms, but pathogenicity is reduced and spore size is abnormal. This type is not obtained in field isolations.
(a) Plus type: Aerial mycelium is relatively coarse, cottony, grey, with moderate elevation and density, and may be slightly aggregated. From below, the substrate is grey in various degrees of density. The general appearance is similar to that of a common non-perithecial form obtained from field isolates. The distinguishing feature is the presence of a few large glomerate perithecial bodies, more or less embedded in the mycelium, and numerous small sooty perithecial elements scattered in patches over the surface. A dendritic perithecial line is formed with minus colonies. Colonies of the plus type have been obtained only rarely from field isolations (Figure 2).
(b) Minus type: Generally, this is similar to the minus type of var. cingulata but shows more variability. Aerial mycelium is grey or black and poorly developed over a dark substrate. Immature perithecial elements are typically present but vary in numbers and may sometimes be absent. In contrast to the minus type of var. cingulata, conidia are abundant, with pinkish spore masses becoming visible over the surface as the culture ages. This type forms a perithecial line with plus colonies, but this has a dendritic margin and lacks the well-defined straight outline of the line formed between var. cingulata plus and minus types. The minus type has not been obtained from field isolations (Figure 2).
(d) Yellow. A yellow isolate, similar to the one produced by G. cingulata, is occasionally obtained, although this is not found in field isolates. Some authors (Sutton, 1962) have suggested using the characteristics of the appressorium as one criterion for separating species of Colletotrichum. The size and shape of the appressoria formed by the species discussed here were briefly investigated, but the differences did not appear to be sufficient to warrant a more detailed examination. The mean length of the appressoria mostly ranged between 8 and 9 µm, with a mean breadth between 6.0 and 6.5 µm. The appressoria of C. atramentarium were somewhat larger, with a mean length of 11.3 µm, while those of C. musae were shorter, averaging 7.7 µm. The majority examined were more or less obovate, but in all species, a varying number of individuals were definitely lobed or angular. The appressoria of C. acutatum were generally more regular, whereas those of C. musae were less so.
(d) Temperature Reactions. Reaction to temperature is a useful criterion for separating some species of Colletotrichum. This characteristic was investigated for the species Glomerella cingulata var. cingulata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor, C. acutatum, C. orbiculare, and C. dematium. Three or four typical isolates were used in each case. The procedure consisted of inoculating potato dextrose agar (PDA) slopes in tubes or medicine bottles with uniform circles cut from a young PDA culture of the test fungus. These were held at room temperature overnight until growth was just beginning to show, then incubated in the compartments of a multiple-temperature incubator over the range of 15°C to 36°C. The temperature interval between compartments was approximately 1.5°C. After four days, growth was recorded as the diameter of the colony minus the diameter of the original inoculum.
The table presents temperature data for five species of Colletotrichum, detailing the number of isolates tested and their optimum growth temperatures. For instance, Glomerella cingulata had three isolates with an optimum growth range between 26.5°C and 28.5°C, while C. gloeosporioides var. minor had five isolates with a similar optimum range of 26.0°C to 28.5°C. The mean growth for these species was recorded at various temperatures, highlighting their performance under optimal conditions.
Figure 5 illustrates the growth-temperature curves for six species of Colletotrichum, showing the mean four-day growth on PDA. Edgerton (1915) previously investigated the temperature curves of 49 cultures of Colletotrichum isolated from 22 different hosts, which fell into six distinct groups.
The temperature reactions of the isolates grouped by Edgerton (1915) as G. fructigenum closely resemble those of the Queensland C. acutatum. In fact, there is nothing in Edgerton's description to indicate that they are not the same organism. However, the spore dimensions usually attributed to G. fructigenum set it apart from C. acutatum, and the former is perhaps more correctly considered a synonym or form of C. gloeosporioides. The four isolates of C. acutatum employed here were derived from papaw. Sturgess (1957), using isolates from strawberry, obtained a somewhat higher optimum temperature for this species. Two recent isolates from strawberry leaves showed an optimum of 26.8 °C.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor is, as expected, very similar to G. cingulata. C. dematium is a moderately fast-growing species with a relatively high optimum and maximum growth temperature. Over the years, species of Colletotrichum have been isolated on many occasions from fruit and vegetative parts of economic plants in Queensland. The pathogenicity of the various species to their usual hosts is well established. In cases where a species has been recovered from a particular host only occasionally and no pathogenicity tests have been carried out, the nature of the lesion and the circumstances of the isolation have been taken as evidence for or against its presence in a pathogenic capacity.
During this work, it became evident that one plant species may serve as a host for more than one species of Colletotrichum, so the identity of the host is not necessarily reliable evidence for the identity of the pathogen. However, some fruits that are particularly prone to anthracnose are typically attacked by only one organism; examples include mango and banana. In contrast, papaw and capsicum are remarkably hospitable hosts.
A host list of the species of Colletotrichum affecting fruit in Queensland is provided in Table 6. Non-fruit hosts are included to complete the picture. In most cases, the specific identity of the pathogen has been determined by both cultural characteristics and spore measurements. The number of collections from which a particular species was obtained is recorded under the specific host-parasite combination concerned. These figures do not necessarily indicate the relative frequency of occurrence on different hosts, except for banana, papaw, mango, avocado, and strawberry, each of which has received significant attention. It is hoped that this paper will pave the way for an extension to this list.
Table 6 presents a comprehensive list of fruit-attacking species of Colletotrichum found in Queensland, along with their respective hosts. The table includes various species, such as Mangifera indica (mango) and Carica papaya (papaw), alongside their occurrence counts. It categorizes the hosts into fruit and non-fruit plants, providing data on how many times each species was isolated from these hosts. For instance, mango had a notable frequency of 23 isolates, while papaw had an even higher occurrence with 34 isolates. Other plants, like Persea americana (avocado) and Cucumis sativus (cucumber), show varying numbers of associations with Colletotrichum species, illustrating the diverse interactions between the pathogens and their plant hosts in Queensland's ecosystem. This information helps in understanding the distribution and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum in relation to specific host plants.
Apium graveolens L. var. dulce (Mill.) Pers.
Matthews (1953, 1955a, 1955b) investigated leaf spots occurring on a number of garden plants and weeds in the Brisbane district. In each case, the associated organism was isolated, and its cultural and morphological characteristics were described, followed by cross-inoculations. The causal organism was considered to be Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, though no attempts were made to distinguish between varieties. However, based on Matthews' papers, separation into G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor can be made with reasonable accuracy. Isolates from azalea (Rhododendron indicum Sweet), Hoya australis R.Br. and H. carnosa R.Br., and a few from stock (Matthiola incana (L.) R.Br.) were likely G. cingulata. Other investigated hosts yielded isolates resembling G. cingulata var. minor or its imperfect state, including stock, cabbage and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var.), alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv.), wallflower (Cheiranthus cheiri L.), oleander (Nerium oleander L.), violet (Viola odorata L.), cestrum (Cestrum parqui L'Herit.), and pigweed (Portulaca oleracea L.).
Artificial inoculations were conducted periodically using a small range of fruit. The method typically involved inserting a portion of mycelium, with or without accompanying spores, into a small triangular cut in the fruit's surface, which were then incubated at room temperature in a moist chamber.
The extent of lesion development can vary considerably even with the same organism, influenced by factors such as fruit variety, ambient temperature, and the culture's history used for inoculation.
Working on this basis, Table 7 presents the total number of positive and negative infections obtained from the individual inoculations attempted. Inoculants are grouped according to their host of origin, providing insight into cross-inoculation potential.
Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. Recorded as the Number of Positive and Negative Lesions Developed in Artificial Inoculation of Six Fruit Hosts: The table summarizes the results of artificial inoculations conducted on six types of fruit hosts: Papaw, Apple, Avocado, Banana, Mango, and Strawberry. Each fruit type is associated with a series of data points indicating the number of positive and negative lesions observed following inoculation.
Papaw: 140 positive and 44 negative lesions.
Passion-fruit: 1150 positive and 1110 negative lesions, indicating a very high rate of infection.
C. gloeosporioides var. Papaw: 152 positive and 31 negative lesions.
Apple: 12 positive and 4 negative lesions.
Avocado: 39 positive and 13 negative lesions.
Custard Apple: 36 positive and 2 negative lesions.
Mango: 11 positive and 9 negative lesions.
Citrus: 9 positive and 6 negative lesions.
Miscellaneous fruits such as Strawberry and Tomato show various positive and negative counts as well.
Overall, the results indicate that a particular isolate is most active in attacking its original host. This trend was notably observed with banana and mango, which are less favored hosts outside of their specific pathogens. Conversely, papaw showed susceptibility to most tested organisms, potentially due to a lack of fungi-toxic reactions in its skin, a characteristic present in banana, mango, and avocado.
Glomerella cingulata (stat. conid.) / Colletotrichum gloeosporioides: This species has a restricted host range as a fruit pathogen in Queensland, primarily causing ripe fruit rot in papaw and skin blemishes in passion-fruit hybrids. Its cultural characteristics include specific spore measurements and the appearance of the black, corrugated spots on papaw. Sterile types may be more challenging to identify.
Glomerella cingulata var. minor (stat. conid.) / Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var.: This specialized form has a broader host range and is commonly found in Queensland. It significantly impacts ripe fruit rot in papaw, avocado, mango, and apple. Notably quick-growing, it produces abundant aerial mycelium in culture, with characteristic normal spore sizes. However, some collections may require cultural examination for accurate identification, especially when spore sizes approach the lower range of typical C. gloeosporioides measurements.
Feel free to ask for any further modifications!
Since the perfect stage of this variety is encountered only rarely in Queensland, it is practical to have a distinguishing name for the conidial state as well. Wollenweber and Hochapfel consider the imperfect state of their G. cingulata var. minor to be Gloeosporium elasticae (Thlim.) Cke. & Mass., listing several synonyms, mainly species occurring on fig and coffee. The conidial measurements provided by Wollenweber and Hochapfel for this species fall within the range obtained for C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland. Given the accepted synonymy of Gloeosporium with Colletotrichum, it would be unwise to continue using the former generic name. Unfortunately, Colletotrichum elasticae is already occupied by C. elasticae Tassi. Aside from the fact that a species name is not readily available, it seems preferable to designate the conidial state of a variety of G. cingulata as a variety of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Therefore, the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. var. minor var. nov. is proposed and is used in this article. A formal description will appear later.
It is possible that some references in literature to G. cingulata pertain to organisms similar to var. minor. For instance, some described by Small (1926) as Colletotrichum coffeanum Noack appear to share characters with this variety. Cultures obtained from tea in Malaya and from avocado in Southern Rhodesia, through the courtesy of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, resembled C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland. Colletotrichum musae (Gloeosporium musarum), originally described from Queensland material, is undoubtedly the organism under discussion. In the literature, it has continued to be referred to by this name. With the general acceptance of Colletotrichum as the correct generic name for organisms formerly classified under Gloeosporium and Colletotrichum, it seems unjustifiable to continue using the binomial Gloeosporium musarum, and a transfer to Colletotrichum is desirable.
After examining type and other materials, Arx (1957a, 1957b) concluded that Gloeosporium musarum Cke. & Mass. is a synonym of Colletotrichum musae (Berk. & Curt.) Arx (Myxosporium musae Berk. & Curt.). In this paper, Colletotrichum musae is used as the name for the banana anthracnose organism. C. musae is the most host-specific of the organisms discussed and is also very consistent in morphological and cultural characteristics. The conidial measurements are similar to those of C. gloeosporioides, while the cultural traits resemble those of a cultural type of C. gloeosporioides var. minor, which appears occasionally. Arx (1957) regarded the fungus as a host-specific form of C. gloeosporioides. It is a rapid grower with a high optimum and maximum temperature, similar to this species. The host-parasite relationships of this organism in Queensland have been investigated in detail (Simmonds and Mitchell 1940; Simmonds 1941, 1963).
The perfect state of G. cingulata has been obtained occasionally from banana (Ashby 1931; Hoette 1935), but these recordings have not been definitively linked with Colletotrichum musae. It seems more likely that they represent a separate and less frequent association with banana, such as the isolates from green banana fruit in Queensland.
Please let me know if you need any further adjustments!
(Sturgess 1957) and a less frequent pathogen affecting various other hosts. The conidia of this species are characteristically variable in length and typically possess pointed ends. Some of the larger spores could be mistaken for those of C. gloeosporioides var. minor, but smaller, more typical ones usually accompany them. Occasionally, collections with abnormally long spores are found; however, these commonly revert to the normal length upon sub-culturing. Cultures are distinctive and show little variation, almost invariably yielding an abundance of conidia for further confirmation. It is possible that some of the named species of Colletotrichum refer to this one. However, the brevity of older descriptions and the tendency to quote extremes rather than means for spore measurements complicate accurate comparisons. This species is not one of the 11 recognized by Arx (1957). With some reluctance, the Queensland organism has therefore been described as a new species. A formal description appears at the end of this article.
This fungus is responsible for characteristic leaf, stem, and fruit spotting in various cucurbits. It is usually considered to be restricted in pathogenicity to members of the Cucurbitaceae family, but in Queensland, the host range has been extended to three plants outside this family. C. orbiculare is a slow-growing species with a low optimum temperature. These characteristics, along with the distinctive spore and cultural traits, make this species one of the easiest to identify. Host specificity occurs, as isolates from celery and safflower do not rot watermelon.
In Queensland, this species is restricted to members of the Solanaceae family. It is the most common Colletotrichum species causing ripe fruit rot in tomatoes, though it is not frequently encountered. Additionally, it is responsible for a somewhat indefinite amount of damage as a potato root-rotting organism. C. atramentarium is easily identified by its long, narrow conidia and the characteristic speckled culture resulting from the formation of sclerotia.
C. dematium is the only species discussed here that possesses sickle-shaped spores. This feature, along with prominent setae, makes identification straightforward. Cultures are somewhat characterless unless spore production is evident. This fungus is responsible for a conspicuous ripe fruit rot in papaw, and while it is not uncommon, it is of less importance than other Colletotrichum species affecting this host.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. var. minor var. nov.
Mycelium: abundant in culture.
Conidia: 14.0 x 3.7 µm (usually 11.1-17.7 x 3.1-5.0 µm).
Status: perithecial; Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. et Schrenk var. minor Wr.
Hosts: causes economic damage in the fruit of Mangifera indica L., Carica papaya L., Persea americana Mill., Malus sylvestris Mill., and many other hosts in Queensland.
Colletotrichum acutatum sp. nov.
Mycelium: slowly growing, partly thin, hyaline; partly thick, brown with more pronounced septa.
Conidia: variable in length, 11.1 x 3.1 µm (usually 8.3-14.4 x 2.5-4.0 µm), with generally pointed ends.
Hosts: found in the fruit of Carica papaya L., Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne, Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. in Queensland.
Diagnostic features: small size, variability in length within a single collection, and pointed ends.
In the host, conidia are produced in acervuli. In culture, they appear to be formed throughout the mycelium, although massed conidiophores resembling acervuli may occur. The spore masses are salmon-colored and, when formed in culture, are often more or less hidden within the mycelium. Setae have not been observed in association with acervuli, but scattered, poorly developed setae occasionally appear in culture. Conidiophores are slender, typically two to three times the length of the spore and about half the width, though they may also be shorter and stouter. Appressoria are rarely lobed, and the germ pore is often poorly defined. The host range and other characteristics of this species have been discussed in more detail in the preceding pages. Representative dried cultures are deposited in the Herbarium of the Botany Department at the University of Queensland and in the Herbarium of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, England.
