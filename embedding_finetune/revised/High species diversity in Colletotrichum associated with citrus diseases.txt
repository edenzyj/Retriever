Species of Colletotrichum are recognized as significant plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes across a variety of plant hosts. Several species are notably problematic for citrus, causing pre- and post-harvest infections such as anthracnose, postbloom fruit drop, tear stain, and stem-end rot, as well as wither-tip on twigs. This study utilized multi-locus sequence typing to investigate the occurrence, diversity, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with citrus and allied genera in European orchards, nurseries, and gardens. Surveys were conducted in Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain during 2015 and 2016, resulting in the isolation of 174 Colletotrichum strains from symptomatic leaves, fruits, petals, and twigs. A multi-locus phylogeny was constructed based on seven genomic loci (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, HIS3, and TUB2), and the morphological characteristics of the isolates were assessed. Preliminary pathogenicity tests were performed on orange fruits using representative isolates. The Colletotrichum strains were classified into three major species complexes. Within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, C. gloeosporioides s.str., and two novel species (C. helleniense and C. hystricis) were identified. In the C. boninense species complex, C. karstii, C. novae-zelandiae, and two novel species (C. catinaense and C. limonicola) were noted, while C. acutatum s.str. was identified as a member of the C. acutatum species complex. C. gloeosporioides and C. karstii were the predominant species isolated. This study represents the first report of C. acutatum on citrus.
C. gloeosporioides s.str. is recognized as the most virulent species affecting fruits. This study enhances our understanding of the species associated with various disease symptoms in citrus fruits and plants, providing valuable information for effective disease management.

Stress conditions or postharvest storage can lead to the development of appressoria from germinating spores. Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi, responsible for numerous diseases across a variety of crops worldwide (Sutton 1992, Cannon et al. 2000, 2012, Cai et al. 2009, Udayanga et al. 2013). Recently, Colletotrichum species have been included in the list of the ten most significant plant pathogenic fungi globally, based on their scientific and economic importance (Dean et al. 2012).
Agricultural losses due to Colletotrichum species particularly affect key staple crops in developing countries throughout the tropics and subtropics (Dean et al. 2012). These species can infect over 30 plant genera (Perfect et al. 1999, Farr et al. 2006, Damm et al. 2012a, b, Farr & Rossman 2017), causing anthracnose disease and postharvest decay in a wide range of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits, as well as grasses, vegetable crops, and ornamental plants (Bailey & Jeger 1992, Bernstein et al. 1995, Freeman & Shabi 1996, Crouch et al. 2009, Lima et al. 2011, Damm et al. 2012a, b, Anderson et al. 2013, Crous et al. 2016b, Guarnaccia et al. 2016, De Silva et al. 2017).
The shift towards multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has significantly changed the classification and species concepts within the Colletotrichum genus (Cannon et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013, 2014, Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria × ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011). Given the economic losses in citrus orchards, understanding these species interactions is crucial.
The citrus industry is one of the most significant fruit sectors globally. The Mediterranean countries rank second only to China in fruit production and are the largest fruit exporters after South Africa (FAO 2016). Therefore, understanding all pathogens affecting this crop is imperative. The current study aimed to investigate the major citrus production areas in Europe through large-scale sampling and to identify isolates using a polyphasic approach. This method revealed many cryptic and new Colletotrichum species associated with citrus, classified into four modern taxonomic species complexes. Surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 across commercial nurseries, orchards, gardens, and plant collections aimed to determine the occurrence of Colletotrichum spp. related to citrus and allied genera (Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, Poncirus). The study's specific objectives included conducting extensive sampling of fresh plant materials, cultivating Colletotrichum isolates, subjecting these isolates to DNA sequence analyses alongside morphological characterization, comparing results with other phylogenetic studies, and evaluating the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species on citrus fruit. Major diseases of citrus caused by Colletotrichum species include postbloom fruit drop (PFD), petal necrosis, and key lime anthracnose (KLA), with C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides being significant agents. Extensive investigations across several citrus-producing regions revealed varying associations of these pathogens with different citrus species.
In 2008, MacKenzie et al. (2009) classified various species such as C. limetti, mandarins, oranges, pummelos, grapefruits, limes, lemons, and cola (Damm et al. 2012a). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was previously thought to be the only species causing post-harvest anthracnose (Brown 1975, Sutton 1980, Freeman & Shabi 1996). However, recent studies have shown that several species of Colletotrichum are associated with fruit decay worldwide (Peng et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, Weir et al. 2012). Huang et al. (2013) demonstrated that C. fructicola and C. truncatum can cause anthracnose on citrus fruits. Additionally, C. gloeosporioides s.lat. has been reported to cause pre-harvest symptoms such as wither-tip on twigs (Klotz 1961, Benyahia et al. 2003) and stem-end rot on fruit (Kaur et al. 2007).
Recently, infections caused by Colletotrichum spp. have severely compromised citrus production in different Mediterranean countries. Heavy pre-harvest anthracnose symptoms were observed on orange fruits and lesions on mandarin leaves in Italy (Aiello et al. 2015, Perrone et al. 2016). Twig wither-tip symptoms were noted on cultivated orange trees in Tunisia (Rhaiem & Taylor 2016), and severe anthracnose symptoms were recorded on unripe and ripe lemon fruits in Portugal (Ramos et al. 2016).
Fungal isolates were obtained through two procedures. In the first procedure, leaf, fruit, and twig fragments (5 × 5 mm) were surface-sterilized in a sodium hypochlorite solution (10%) for 20 seconds, followed by 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, and rinsed three times in sterilized water. The fragments were dried on sterilized tissue paper and placed on malt extract agar (MEA; Crous et al. 2009) amended with 100 μg/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (MEA-PS), then incubated at 25 °C until characteristic Colletotrichum colonies were observed. In the second procedure, plant material was incubated in moist chambers at room temperature (25 °C ± 3 °C) for up to 10 days and inspected daily for fungal sporulation. Sporulating conidiomata obtained through both procedures were collected and crushed in a drop of sterile water, then spread over the surface of MEA-PS plates. After 24 hours, germinating spores were individually transferred onto MEA plates. The isolates used in this study are maintained in the culture collection of the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands, and in the working collection of Pedro Crous (CPC) housed at the Westerdijk Institute.
For DNA extraction, genomic DNA was isolated using a Wizard® Genomic DNA Purification Kit (Promega Corporation, WI, USA), following the manufacturer's instructions. Partial regions of seven loci were amplified. The primers ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990) were used to amplify the internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of the nuclear ribosomal RNA operon, including the 3’ end of the 18S rRNA, the first internal transcribed spacer region, the 5.8S rRNA gene, the second internal transcribed spacer region, and the 5’ end of the 28S rRNA gene. The primers CL1 and CL2 (O’Donnell et al. 2000) were used for part of the calmodulin (CAL) gene. The partial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene was amplified using primers GDF1 + GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003). The primers ACT-512F and ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999) amplified part of the actin gene (ACT). The partial beta-tubulin (TUB2) gene was amplified with primers T1 (Glass & Donaldson 1995) and Bt-2b (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997). The primers CHS-79F and CHS-345R (Carbone & Kohn 1999) were used for part of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1) gene. The partial histone 3 (HIS3) gene was amplified using primers CYLH3F and CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b).
The PCR products were sequenced in both directions using the BigDye® Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). After sequencing, amplicons were purified through Sephadex G-50 Fine columns (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) in MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). The purified sequence reactions were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The generated DNA sequences were analyzed, and consensus sequences were computed using the program SeqMan Pro (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).
Novel sequences generated in this study were compared against the NCBI GenBank nucleotide database to determine the closest relatives for a taxonomic framework of the studied isolates. Alignments of different gene regions, including sequences obtained from this study and sequences downloaded from GenBank, were initially performed using the MAFFT v. 7 online server (http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/index.html) (Katoh & Standley 2013), and then manually adjusted in MEGA v. 6.06 (Tamura et al. 2013). To establish the identity of isolates at the species level, phylogenetic analyses were conducted first individually for each locus (data not shown) and then as concatenated analyses of seven loci. Two separate analyses were conducted for the C. boninense species complex and the remainder of the Colletotrichum spp. included in this study. Additional reference sequences were selected based on recent studies on Colletotrichum species (Damm et al. 2012a, b; Weir et al. 2012; Huang et al. 2013).
Phylogenetic analyses were based on Maximum Parsimony (MP) for all individual loci and on both MP and Bayesian Inference (BI) for the multilocus analyses. For BI, the best evolutionary model for each partition was determined using MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) and incorporated into the analyses. MrBayes v. 3.2.5 (Ronquist et al. 2012) was used to generate phylogenetic trees under optimal criteria per partition. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis used four chains and started from a random tree topology. The heating parameter was set to 0.2, and trees were sampled every 1,000 generations. Analyses stopped once the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. The MP analyses were conducted using PAUP (Swofford 2003). Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by heuristic searches with 100 random addition sequences. Tree bisection-reconnection was used, with the branch swapping option set to ‘best trees’ only, with all characters weighted equally and alignment gaps treated as a fifth state. Tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), and rescaled consistency index (RC) were calculated for parsimony, and the bootstrap analyses (Hillis & Bull 1993) were based on 1,000 replications. Sequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank, and alignments and phylogenetic trees were stored in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org).
)×100%. The inoculated fungi were re-isolated from the lesions obtained, and the identity of the re-isolated fungi was confirmed by sequencing the ACT and GAPDH loci, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates.
Agar plugs (6-mm diameter) were taken from the edge of actively growing cultures on PDA and transferred to the center of 9-cm plates.
Agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976) was utilized as described in recent studies (Huang et al. 2013, Diao et al. 2017). Cultures were incubated for 10 days at 25 °C with a 12/12 hour light/dark cycle. Symptoms of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. were frequently observed on several citrus species in all countries investigated. The leaves exhibited necrotic spots that were more or less circular. These lesions appeared pale brown to purple, with colony colors rated according to the development of ascomata, conidiomata, and setae (Rayner 1970). Colony diameters were measured after 7 and 10 days. Different symptoms also appeared on fruits, including irregular and sunken lesions of variable sizes, ranging from purple-brown to black. Mummified fruits were occasionally observed in association with affected tips. Under high moisture conditions, pink masses of spores appeared, sporulating in acervuli. A dark-brown to black rot with a well-defined margin at the stem end was sometimes detected.
For pathogenicity testing, fruits from two sweet orange (Citrus sinensis) clones (‘Tarocco Scirè’ and ‘Tarocco Nucellare’) were collected in Sicily during the veraison stage and used for artificial inoculation. A total of 174 monosporic isolates resembling Colletotrichum were collected from different locations across Europe (Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain, and Portugal). Among them, 67 isolates were obtained from leaves, 72 from twigs, 28 from fruits, and seven from petals. Eight fruits for each isolate/clone combination were inoculated. The fruits were surface-disinfected with 70% ethanol and rinsed with sterilized water. Inoculation was performed by injuring the fruits at six points with a sterile pipette tip and injecting a spore suspension (1.0 × 10^5 conidia/mL) into each point.
Phylogenetic analyses involved the 14 maximum parsimony (MP) trees derived from single gene sequence alignments of Colletotrichum species, including C. boninense, and confirmed that 30 isolates recovered in this study belong to this species complex. The testing revealed the percentage of infected inoculation points of citrus fruits.
This study investigates the points (%) of sequences from Colletotrichum acutatum (culture CBS 112996). All species belonging to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes were included in a combined phylogenetic analysis consisting of 86 sequences, incorporating outgroup sequences from Moniolochaetes infuscans (CBS 896.96). A total of 3,149 characters were used in both phylogenetic analyses, categorized as follows: ITS (1–549), GAPDH (556–863), ACT (870–1166), CAL (1173–1946), CHS-1 (1953–2237), TUB2 (2244–2754), and HIS3 (2761–3149).
For the phylogeny of the C. boninense species complex, 411 characters were identified as parsimony-informative, 454 were variable and parsimony-uninformative, and 2,248 characters were constant. A maximum of 1,000 equally most parsimonious trees were generated (Tree length = 1,236, CI = 0.871, RI = 0.947, and RC = 0.825). Regarding the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes, 1,171 characters were parsimony-informative, while 319 were variable and parsimony-uninformative.
Figure 1 illustrates symptoms on citrus tissues associated with various Colletotrichum species. It includes examples such as anthracnose symptoms on leaves of naturally infected Citrus bergamia and Fortunella margarita. Other images depict mummified fruit of Citrus limon, various lesions on fruits like oranges and mandarins, tear stains on grapefruit, and typical anthracnose on fallen orange fruits, as well as the wither-tip of a Citrus sinensis tree.
In terms of species distribution, the table provides a detailed listing of various Colletotrichum strains along with their respective hosts and origins. Notably, C. acutatum is associated with Citrus limon from New Zealand and C. boninense from Crinum asiaticum in Japan. Other strains, like C. catinaense, are linked to Citrus sinensis from Portugal, and C. limonicola is reported from Malta. The table also lists strains with their respective collection codes and genetic identifiers, indicating their geographic origins ranging from Australia to various European countries.
Colletotrichum acutatum (CBS 112996), rooted to Moniolochaetes infuscans (CBS 896.96), is linked to various plant hosts across multiple countries, such as Ipomoea batatas in South Africa, Citrus sp. in New Zealand, and Olea europaea in Portugal.
Additional entries list other species like Hakea sericea, Carica papaya, and several types of Citrus, indicating their origins in Australia, Brazil, and Italy among others.
The analysis also includes reference strains such as Coffea arabica from Kenya, showing their connection to species like C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.
A consensus phylogram was created from a Bayesian analysis involving 9,782 trees based on the combined sequences of various genes (ITS, CAL, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and HIS3) for the Colletotrichum acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complex.
The tree was rooted to Moniolochaetes infuscans (CBS 896.96).
A total of 1,623 characters were constant, with 1,000 equally partitioned datasets revealing 167 unique site patterns.
The parsimony analysis provided bootstrap support values, indicating robust phylogenetic relationships.
Bootstrap support values and Bayesian posterior probabilities were illustrated at the nodes, with the asterisk (*) symbol denoting full support (1.00/100). The analysis involved a lengthy run of 4,890,000 generations, with 7,338 trees ultimately used to calculate posterior probabilities.
In the C. boninense species complex, 19 citrus isolates clustered with six reference strains of C. karstii, while five isolates were closely associated with the ex-type of C. novae-zelandiae. Additionally, three isolates were identified as C. catinaense and another three as C. limonicola, forming two highly supported subclades (1.00/100) within the same clade.
The HIS3 partition analysis ran for 2,260,000 generations, resulting in 4,522 trees, of which 3,392 were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. Two isolates were identified as C. hystricis (closely related to C. alienum) and four as C. helleniense (close to C. kahawae subspecies) within the C. gloeosporioides species complex.
Table Description: The table presents various isolates of citrus species along with their corresponding locations and identifiers. Each entry includes the isolate code (e.g., CPC 27939), the species of citrus (e.g., Citrus limon, Citrus sinensis), the country of origin (e.g., Portugal, Spain, Italy), and the posterior probability values associated with each isolate. Some entries have additional numerical values indicating support levels (e.g., 0.52/- or 1/97) that represent the confidence in the phylogenetic relationships. The diversity of citrus species from different regions highlights the complex interactions and relationships within the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complex.
Morphological observations supported by phylogenetic inference were used to identify four known species: C. gloeosporioides, C. novae-zelandiae, C. karstii, and C. acutatum. In the analysis of the C. boninense species complex, the TUB2 locus differentiated all the taxa. Furthermore, the CAL and GAPDH loci clearly separated C. catinaense and all the Colletotrichum limonicola species, respectively.
In this study, morphological characteristics were assessed to determine four novel species, as illustrated in Figures 4–7. Hyphal surfaces and appressoria were noted to differ in GAPDH sequences. Additionally, C. helleniense was separated by CAL and TUB2, while ACT and CHS-1 distinguished C. hystricis.
Based on both phylogenetic and morphological analyses, the four distinct novel species are described below.
Colletotrichum catinaense Guarnaccia & Crous, sp. nov. — Dimensions: approximately 0.7 × 4.7 ± 0.5 µm, L/W ratio = 2.6. Appressoria are medium to dark brown, roundish or irregular in shape, found singly or in small groups, measuring 5–10 × 7–15 µm.
The species name is derived from Catania, the ancient Latin name for the city where the first strain was collected. This strain features hyaline, septate hyphae and angular setae, measuring 3.5–7 µm in diameter. The asexual morph observed on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) includes chlamydospores, which are dark brown, 55–90 µm long, with a conical or inflated base and absent tip setae. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 40 μm in length.
Conidiogenous cells are rounded, hyaline, smooth-walled, and cylindrical to inflated, measuring 5–18 × 4–5.5 µm. Conidia are also hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical with a rounded apex and base, granular and guttulate in content, measuring 11.5–15 × 4–5.5 µm, with mean dimensions of 13.5 ± 0.9 × 4.8 ± 0.5 µm, L/W ratio = 2.7.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, measuring 40–46 mm in diameter after 7 days (54–59 mm after 10 days). Colonies on PDA are flat, with an entire margin, exhibiting a color range from green to grey in the center, covered with floccose white aerial mycelium and black conidiomata. Conidia appear in a pinkish-orange mass, with the reverse side showing a buff color and pale luteous to isabelline margins, measuring 66–68 mm in diameter after 7 days (75–76 mm after 10 days).
Materials Examined: GREECE, Arta, collected from wither-tip twigs of Poncirus trifoliata (citrumelo) on May 20, 2015, by V. Guarnaccia (CBS H-23025, holotype), and from fruit lesions of C. reticulata (mandarin) on the same date (culture CBS 142419 = CPC 27107).
Notes: Colletotrichum helleniense was isolated from fruit lesions of Citrus reticulata and from Poncirus trifoliata wither-tip twigs in Greece. Poncirus is closely related to Citrus, belonging to the Rutaceae family, primarily used as rootstock. This study highlights the ability of C. helleniense to colonize tissues across different genera within Rutaceae. Phylogenetic analysis indicates that this species is closely related yet distinct from C. kahawae based on GAPDH, CAL, and TUB2 genes.
Isolation: From fruit tear-stain of Citrus sinensis (orange), 7 Oct. 2015, V. Guarnaccia.
Recently, the legitimacy of the distinction between Colletotrichum catinaense and its close relatives has been supported by Batista et al. (2016), who recognized the two subspecies as separate cryptic species. Colletotrichum helleniense is clearly distinct from both C. aotearoa and C. kahawae, as well as C. cordylinicola and C. rhexiae (data not shown), despite being part of the same genetic clade (Diao et al. 2017, Weir et al. 2012). Therefore, C. helleniense represents a new species within the C. kahawae clade, genetically close to but clearly differentiated from C. novae-zelandiae in CAL and TUB sequences.
Colletotrichum novae-zelandiae previously formed a separate lineage/cluster in all single-gene phylogenies (Damm et al. 2012b) prior to this study. Based on multi-locus phylogenetic analyses performed in this study, C. catinaense and C. limonicola (described below) are new species belonging to the same clade as C. novae-zelandiae within the C. boninense species complex. Morphologically, this species is indistinguishable from the other two species in the same clade.
Colletotrichum hystricis Guarnaccia & Crous, sp. nov.
Etymology: Named in reference to its occurrence on Citrus hystrix.
Vegetative hyphae are hyaline, septate, and range from 1–7 µm in diameter. Conidiomata, chlamydospores, and setae are absent. Conidiophores are formed from hyphae, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can be up to 40 μm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 5–10 × 4–5 µm. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to obovoidal with rounded apex and base, containing granular material, measuring 13–15 × 4–5.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14 ± 1.3 × 4.8 ± 0.5 µm and a length/width ratio of 2.8. Appressoria are dark brown, globose to irregularly shaped, single, with irregular lobes, measuring 3.5–8 × 3–5.5 µm (mean ± SD = 6 ± 0.9 × 4.2 ± 0.5 µm), giving a length/width ratio of 1.4.
Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells measuring 3.5–7 µm in diameter. Setae are brown, smooth, 2–3-septate, curved, and range from 50–100 µm long with a conical dark brown base and rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can grow to 50 μm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, and cylindrical to inflated, measuring 5–15 × 4–5 µm. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with rounded apex and base, and contain granular or guttulate material, measuring 11–14.5 × 4–5.5 µm (mean ± SD = 12.2).
Fig. 6: Displays various morphological aspects of Colletotrichum hystricis, including colonies on PDA, conidiomata, conidiophores, conidia, appressoria, and setae, with scale bars measuring 10 μm.
Fig. 7: Illustrates Colletotrichum limonicola, showcasing colonies on PDA, conidiomata, conidia, appressoria, setae, and conidiophores, also with scale bars of 10 μm.
Morphology and Growth: The pathogenic fungus exhibits conidia with a size of 14–16 × 4.5–6 µm, with a mean and standard deviation of 13.8 ± 1 × 5.1 ± 0.4 µm. The length-to-width (L/W) ratio is 2.7.
Culture Characteristics: On SNA (Synthetic Nutrient Agar), the colonies are flat with an entire margin, hyaline in color, measuring 60–61 mm in diameter after 7 days (72–75 mm after 10 days). On PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar), colonies also appear flat, with an entire margin and color varying from buff honey to pinkish, exhibiting a green to grey margin and entirely covered with white aerial mycelium and black conidiomata. The reverse side shows buff to pale luteous to dark green coloration, measuring 69–71 mm in diameter after 7 days (80–82 mm after 10 days).
In tests, all isolates except for Colletotrichum acutatum were pathogenic to most detached orange fruits. Both tested clones of Citrus sinensis developed typical brown lesions around fruit wounds after 10 days. Among the eight species inoculated, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. karstii exhibited the highest and weakest aggressiveness, respectively, with the clone ‘Tarocco Scirè’ being notably more susceptible. The Colletotrichum isolates were successfully re-isolated from symptomatic tissues, confirming Koch’s postulates, while negative controls showed no symptoms.
Isolation Notes: Colletotrichum hystricis was isolated from leaf lesions of Citrus hystrix in Sicily, Italy. This species is genetically distinct from closely related species, as evidenced by differences in GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences. Morphologically, it resembles C. alienum and other species like C. aenigma, C. conoides, and C. nupharicola, but it represents a distinct taxon supported by morphological features. It can be differentiated from C. alienum by its obovoidal conidia and slower growth rate.
Colletotrichum limonicola: A new species, Colletotrichum limonicola, is introduced, with MycoBank reference MB820254.
Asexual Morphology: On SNA, vegetative hyphae are hyaline, septate, branched, and range from 1–10 µm in diameter. Conidiomata, chlamydospores, and setae are absent. Conidiophores arise from hyphae and are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 50 μm in length. Conidiogenous cells are smooth-walled, cylindrical to inflated, measuring 5–20 × 4–5 µm. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, containing granular contents, measuring 9–15 × 4–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.2 ± 1.3 × 6 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.5. Appressoria are medium to dark brown, roundish, single, measuring 3–6 × 3–5.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 4.5 ± 0.9 × 4.2 ± 0.5 µm.
Discussion: Recent phylogenetic studies of the genus Colletotrichum have revealed clustering in 11 major clades, including significant species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. boninense, C. gloeosporioides, and C. truncatum. These studies facilitate the differentiation and description of numerous taxa.
Colletotrichum spp. are frequently linked with various citrus diseases worldwide, including PFD (Post Fruit Drop) on sweet orange, KLA (Kumquat Leaf Anthracnose), and post-harvest anthracnose across different hosts.

The conidiomata are acervular, and conidiophores of C. acutatum were identified as the only species responsible for the observed symptoms. Setae are formed on a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled structures. In studies conducted by Peres et al. (2008) and Brown et al. (1996), C. gloeosporioides was reported as the sole species causing citrus fruit anthracnose (Brown 1975, Timmer et al. 2000).
During the last decade, a polyphasic approach has been utilized in various studies of Colletotrichum, revealing new species associated with citrus diseases, such as C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides linked to post-harvest fruit decay (PFD) (Lima et al. 2011, Crous et al. 2015, Silva et al. 2016).
Colonies on SNA (Synthetic Nutrient Agar) are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, measuring 44–46 mm in diameter after 7 days (58–60 mm in 10 days). On PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar), colonies are flat with an entire margin, displaying a color gradient from buff honey in the center to green olivaceous at the margin, entirely covered with floccose white aerial mycelium and black conidiomata. Conidia appear as an orange to pale brown mass. The reverse side is buff, pale luteous to dark green, measuring 64–66 mm in diameter after 7 days (75–76 mm in 10 days).
Samples were collected from Gozo, Malta, including wither-tip twigs of Citrus limon (lemon) on July 11, 2016, by V. Guarnaccia (CBS H-23027 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 142410 = CPC 31141), and leaf lesions of C. limon on September 22, 2015 (culture CBS 142409 = CPC 27861).
Colletotrichum limonicola was isolated from leaf lesions and twigs with wither-tip symptoms on Citrus limon in Malta. This species is phylogenetically close to, but distinctly differentiated from, C. novae-zelandiae based on GAPDH and TUB gene sequences.
The analysis included single gene and multilocus DNA sequence analyses combining seven loci (ITS, CAL, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and HIS3), commonly used in previous phylogenetic studies of the C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. boninense species complexes (Damm et al. 2012a, b; Weir et al. 2012; Bragança et al. 2016).
Figure 8 depicts the pathogenicity test of selected Colletotrichum isolates on Citrus sinensis fruits after 10 days. The fruits were inoculated with various isolates, including C. gloeosporioides (CBS 142408), C. catinaense (CBS 142417), C. limonicola (CBS 142410), C. novae-zelandiae (CBS 142414), C. hystricis (CBS 142411), C. helleniense (CBS 142418), and C. karstii (CBS 142415).
In this study, the C. acutatum species complex was identified exclusively on the Aeolian Islands (Italy), a volcanic archipelago located north of Sicily.
Eight species associated with leaf spot on grapefruit in Greece and twig cankers on orange and lemon trees in Malta were identified. Additionally, four new species were detected and described from several citrus orchards surveyed across Mediterranean plant nurseries and private collections in European countries. We further investigated host plant members of Citrus and allied genera, which are also economically important as ornamental plants (e.g., Atlantia, Murraya) or rootstock (e.g., Poncirus).
Colletotrichum catinaense was associated with multiple symptoms on different hosts in Italy and Portugal. Colletotrichum helleniense was isolated from anthracnose on Citrus reticulata and leaf lesions on Poncirus. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was recovered from symptomatic tissues in Malta from leaf lesions on lemon plants. C. karstii, part of the C. boninense species complex, was among the predominant species found. However, while C. gloeosporioides was present in all investigated countries, C. karstii was not isolated from samples collected in Greece. Furthermore, C. acutatum s.str. was noted in these investigations.
The pathogenicity of all the species isolated from citrus samples collected in Europe was preliminarily tested on two clones of Citrus sinensis. Representative isolates were selected and artificially inoculated on orange fruits of clones ‘Tarocco Scirè’ and ‘Tarocco Nucellare’ (Rapisarda & Russo 2003).
The study also detailed the global distribution of Colletotrichum species occurring in Citrus hosts and allied genera in a comprehensive table. The table outlined various species complexes and specific species, alongside their respective hosts and geographical distributions. For instance, C. acutatum was associated with Citrus sinensis flowers and leaves, while C. gloeosporioides appeared in diverse hosts such as Citrus limon and Murraya paniculata, with distributions noted in regions including Brazil, China, Italy, Malta, and the USA.
Colletotrichum species tested, with the exception of C. acutatum, developed lesions on fruits, indicating a cross-infection potential among multiple species affecting two clones of citrus. Notably, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was the most aggressive species, causing typical brown lesions that affected both the skin and albedo tissues. Although C. karstii showed the lowest aggressiveness, it still demonstrated the ability to cause lesions, as did other species, including C. catinaense, C. helleniense, C. hystricis, C. limonicola, and C. novae-zelandiae. The clone ‘Tarocco Scirè’ was more susceptible than ‘Tarocco Nucellare’, aligning with findings from Aiello et al. (2015) regarding C. gloeosporioides and C. karstii.
C. acutatum is known as a common pathogen of various crops, including citrus, globally (Damm et al. 2012a). In Europe, it has been detected on hosts such as strawberry (Garrido et al. 2008), strawberry tree (Polizzi et al. 2011), and olives (Moral et al. 2008), but not on citrus until now. Furthermore, C. novae-zelandiae was previously reported from grapefruit and chili in New Zealand (Damm et al. 2012b). This study marks the first report of C. acutatum associated with citrus in Europe and the first detection of C. novae-zelandiae outside of New Zealand. C. karstii, part of the C. boninense species complex, has a wide geographical distribution and has been reported on citrus in South Africa, New Zealand, and China (Damm et al. 2012b, Peng et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2013).

In Europe, Colletotrichum karstii has also been detected on various hosts, including tropical fruits, cotton, and lupine plants (Damm et al. 2012b, Ismail et al. 2015). In our investigation, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was predominantly observed, consistent with recent global findings (Lima et al. 2011, Huang et al. 2013, Aiello et al. 2015, Honger et al. 2016, Ramos et al. 2016, Rhaiem & Taylor 2016). This species was isolated from all citrus organs sampled—leaves, flowers, fruits, and twigs—demonstrating its status as the most aggressive Colletotrichum species. It is recognized as a pathogen of major cultivated citrus species worldwide (Huang et al. 2013). Notably, this study represents the first report of C. gloeosporioides associated with citrus flower disease in Europe, a finding previously reported in Brazil (Lima et al. 2011).
Additionally, Colletotrichum catinaense and C. limonicola represent new species within the C. novae-zelandiae clade of the C. boninense species complex. C. catinaense has been recovered from infections in diverse citrus species, while C. limonicola has been identified from other hosts within the Rutaceae family. Furthermore, C. helleniense shows the capability to colonize various genera within the Rutaceae, highlighting its economically significant traits, such as cold temperature tolerance and resistance to Citrus Tristeza Virus (Garnsey & Barrett 1987).
Batista et al. (2016) also supported the distinction of two subspecies of C. kahawae, identifying them as cryptic species. Among these, C. kahawae subsp. cigarro is noted. This report emphasizes the importance of recognizing C. gloeosporioides as a major threat to citrus crops in Europe.

Colletotrichum niense is phylogenetically close to both subspecies of C. kahawae, but it is clearly differentiated based on multi-locus phylogenetic analyses. Thus, it represents a new species within the C. kahawae clade in the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Cannon et al., 2000).
Cannon, PF, Buddie AG, and Bridge PD (2008) provided insights into the typification of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in their study published in Mycotaxon (104: 189–204). Additionally, C. hystricis, which is closely related to Citrus hystrix, was isolated from lesions cultivated on leaves and is known for its pleasant smell, being referred to as medicinal lime (Yaacob & Subhadrabandhu, 1995). While the fruit is not widely appreciated, it holds economic importance for the extraction of essential oils, often used in cooking and cosmetics (Allen, 1967).
Colletotrichum hystricis is distinct from C. alienum, which is commonly associated with cultivated fruits (Weir et al., 2012). In the present study, C. hystricis is described as a distinct taxon, supported by morphological differences such as the presence of obovoidal conidia and a slower growth rate in culture. Notably, C. alienum is characterized by the development of perithecia in culture, which the two strains of C. hystricis did not produce on artificial media in this study.
Various studies highlight the significance of Colletotrichum species in agriculture. Crouch et al. (2009) discussed anthracnose disease caused by the novel species Colletotrichum navitas, while Damm et al. (2013) addressed the Colletotrichum orbiculare species complex, which affects field crops and weeds. Other works by Damm et al. (2012) explored the Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum boninense species complexes.
Further research emphasizes the need for effective fungal identification to secure global food and fiber supplies (Crous et al., 2016a). Crous et al. have also contributed significantly to fungal biodiversity literature and the description of new fungal species in various journals, outlining the ongoing developments in mycology.
