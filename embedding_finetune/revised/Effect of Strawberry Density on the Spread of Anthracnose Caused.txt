The spread of strawberry anthracnose, resulting from the rain splash dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia, was determined in field plots by assessing fruit disease incidence at various distances from an introduced point source of infected fruit with sporulating lesions. Four within-row plant densities were established in replicated plots over two years. A generalized linear model with a logit link function and binomial distribution for incidence was used to quantify the effects of distance from the spore source, side of the row relative to the inoculum source, plant density treatment, and their interactions on disease incidence.
At all assessment times, there was a significant (P ≤ 0.05) decline in incidence with increasing distance from the spore source. Moreover, row side had a significant effect, with the near side exhibiting a higher incidence than the far side. Plant density treatment had a significant, albeit nonlinear, effect on incidence, which generally declined with increasing density. The side of the row relative to the inoculum source and density treatment influenced the steepness of the incidence decline.
The role of host density in disease dynamics is poorly understood, yet it may be crucial in regulating spatial and temporal aspects of epidemics in both natural and agricultural ecosystems. In unmanaged or minimally managed communities, density-dependent plant mortality mediated by pathogen activity has been suggested in some studies. However, confounding variables in these systems have hindered a clear demonstration of a causal relationship between density and disease.
In agricultural settings, where growers can directly control density through planting, replanting, and thinning, and indirectly through pest control and fertility management, empirical evaluations of density-disease relations are possible. This presents an opportunity for new disease management strategies via density regulation for specific crops.
Burdon and Chilvers reviewed studies involving over 40 host-pathogen combinations, with the majority (62%) indicating positive correlations between plant density and disease intensity. Nevertheless, some pathosystems have shown negative correlations, inconsistent results, or a lack of relationship between plant density and disease intensity. Differences in disease cycles, assessment techniques, and the occurrence of complicating variables (e.g., changes in host patterns as density changes) complicate comparisons among these studies.
Additional Keywords: Fragaria × ananassa, quantitative epidemiology.
The epidemiological models of Anderson and May, which emphasize animal systems, suggest that increasing host density will enhance the likelihood of contact between an infectious unit (e.g., spores in transport or spores on a lesion) and a healthy unit (e.g., leaf or fruit), thereby increasing the rates of disease development. This forms part of the intuitive basis for speculating that disease incidence will rise with host density, which assigns pathogen dispersal a primary role in the system. However, with a few exceptions, there is limited empirical evaluation of density effects on pathogen dispersal.
A detailed study of the splash-dispersed fungal pathogen Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds, the cause of strawberry anthracnose, using simulated rain, revealed significant reductions in spore deposition (per unit of area and time) both within and between strawberry rows as plant density increased. Interestingly, spore deposition did not decrease in a straightforward linear manner with rising plant density, and density still influenced deposition between rows even when the inoculum source was outside the canopy. The authors proposed three mechanisms by which density may influence dispersal: (1) reduction in spore removal from the inoculum source due to sheltering, (2) reduction in the resplash of spore-carrying droplets, and (3) direct interception of spores in splash droplets by the plant canopy. The results indicated that all three mechanisms were functioning and interacting, illustrating the complex nature of density influences on dispersal in this system.
The complexity of the splash-dispersal system necessitates not only a detailed examination of individual mechanisms through controlled experiments (such as with a rain simulator) but also a phenomenological approach that evaluates the overall impact of density on disease spread over space and time for specific crops and pathogens. In this study, we assessed the development of anthracnose fruit rot from a point source of inoculum in strawberry plots planted at various densities over two seasons. A generalized linear statistical model, incorporating the spatial and plant density treatment aspects of the epidemic, was employed to quantify disease incidence.
Plot establishment: Sixteen 2 × 2 m plots were planted with strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne ‘Midway’; Brittinghams Nursery, Salisbury, MD) in spring 1991 (for the 1992 experiment) and spring 1992 (for the 1993 experiment) at the experimental farm of the Ohio Agricultural Research and Development Center, Wooster, OH. The plots for the 1992 and 1993 experiments were separated by 50 m, and plots were 2 m apart within each site. In both years, three rows, spaced 1 m apart, were planted in each plot in an east-west orientation and maintained during the first season using routine husbandry techniques, including straw mulching and blossom removal. The mulch was removed from within the plots but not between them during the experiments to help ensure adequate intraplot dispersal.
The plots established for the 1993 experiments were initially planted in 1992, with intrarow spacings of 7 cm (four plots), 15 cm (four plots), and 30 cm (eight plots). In May 1993, four of the low-density plots were thinned to a 60-cm spacing to achieve a fourth density. Runners were allowed to root only in the two high-density plots. The number of plants per meter of row remained the same as in 1992.
Inoculation and Assessment: Plots were infested by placing five infected fruit with abundant conidia, prepared as previously described (31, 44), midway between the south and middle rows at the east end of each plot. This method was similar to that used by Madden et al. (see Fig. 1 in literature citation 30), except that they placed their inoculum 30 cm from the end of the rows. Inoculum placement occurred when susceptible (white-colored) fruit were abundant and immediately prior to a rain event, specifically on 14 June 1992 and 7 June 1993. Ripe fruit were manually removed from all plants before infestation, and the inoculum source fruit were removed after 24 hours.
Plots were assessed approximately twice weekly by removing ripe fruit and recording disease status (diseased/healthy [symptomless]) along with their positions (distance from the east end of the row, row number, and side of the row). The fruit on the easternmost plant of the south and middle rows were not removed to provide a continuous inoculum source throughout the experiment. The removal of fruit from the rest of the plots mimicked standard commercial harvesting techniques and helped reduce secondary disease spread since inoculum was eliminated with the diseased fruit. Assessments for the 1992 experiments were conducted on 23, 26, and 29 June, and 2 July. In 1993, assessments occurred on 17, 21, 24, and 29 June.
All assessed fruit were categorized based on calculated straight-line distances from the original inoculum source, as previously described (30). Fruit disease incidence was determined as the proportion of fruit with anthracnose symptoms (y) for each row side (near or far side, relative to the inoculum) in several distance categories. These categories were 0 to 60 cm, 61 to 120 cm, 121 to 180 cm, 181 to 240 cm, and 241+ cm. The midpoints of these distances were used as actual distances in graphs and analyses. Categories were created to ensure a sufficient number of fruit for calculating y as a function of distance from the source.
Rain Collection: Rain near ground level within a row (throughfall plus leaf drip) was measured to assess the influence of plant density treatment on rain penetration through the canopy. This method collected rain that was not directly intercepted by the canopy and also gathered rain that dripped or splashed to the ground. It did not capture rain that was intercepted and then evaporated, absorbed, or splashed away from the row. Polypropylene disposable cups (89-ml volume, opening diameter of 5.3 cm; Solo Cup Co., Urbana, IL) were used to collect rain approximately 1 to 2 cm above the soil surface. To facilitate easy removal of the cups and prevent soil and surface water from entering them, a rubber stopper was taped to the bottom of each cup, which was then placed inside a second cup permanently buried in the ground, with holes punched in the bottom for drainage. In 1992, rain was collected at two locations in one row of each replicate plot, using the central 1 m of the row most interior to the area containing all plots. One sample cup was placed midway between non-runner crowns, and a second cup was placed near a non-runner crown. Four additional cups were located in open areas of the research site without any canopy cover. A total of fourteen rain episodes were sampled, including times before inoculum introduction and after disease assessments were completed.
Total rainfall (cubic centimeters per square centimeter, converted to a depth measurement of millimeters) within and outside the canopy for each rain event was calculated from the water volume collected in each rain sample cup, the area of the cup, and the duration of the event determined from a tipping-bucket rain gauge (model TE525; Campbell Scientific Inc., Logan, UT) located adjacent to the plots. Data from the two cup locations in a plot were averaged for a whole-plot estimate, except for the lowest density plots. In these cases, sample cups positioned midway between plants were always located in open gaps in the canopy. It was estimated that such gaps covered one-third of the row area sampled, whereas two-thirds of the row was under the canopy, sampled by the second cup nearer the crown. Data from the two cups were weighted accordingly to reflect the areas sampled in order to obtain a whole-plot rainfall estimate. Data for each plot were divided by the mean value from the sample cups outside the plots to determine rainfall amounts relative to ambient levels.
In addition to the rain measurements, a sheltered thermistor and a leaf wetness grid (models 107 and 237, respectively; Campbell Scientific Inc.) were used to electronically measure temperature and leaf wetness at mid-canopy level in one row of one plot representing each treatment. Similar probes and a resistance-based relative humidity sensor were positioned at a site away from the strawberry canopy. Data were recorded at 10-minute intervals throughout the season on a 21X datalogger (Campbell Scientific Inc.). An “index of predicted infection” associated with each rain event was calculated based on the wetness duration (rain duration plus the wetness period after the rain stopped) and average temperature during the wet period. The index was calculated using Equation 3 in Wilson et al. (41), as done previously (30), and was based on the predicted proportion of inoculated fruit that became infected by C. acutatum in controlled studies with the specified wetness duration and temperature.
Infection Post-deposition: A study was conducted to determine if the micro-environment within the canopies varied in terms of favorableness for fruit infection. The effect of plant density treatment on fruit infection post-deposition was assessed by determining the disease incidence of inoculated, detached fruit placed within each treatment row canopy and in unsheltered areas adjacent to the plot site. Greenhouse-grown fruit (‘Midway’) at the white stage were collected with the pedicels and inoculated in the laboratory as previously described (43), using a concentration of 1 × 10³ conidia/ml. This inoculum density produces a fruit disease incidence of approximately 0.5 with 12 hours of wetness at 25°C in controlled-environment chambers (41).
The effects of plant density treatment (Ti; i = 1 [highest density], 2, 3, or 4 [lowest density]), row side (Sj; j = 1 [near] or 2 [far]), distance from the inoculum source (d; a continuous variable), and their interactions on fruit disease incidence (y; ranging from 0 to 1) were determined using a generalized linear model (GLM) with the GLIM program. Treatment and row side were treated as categorical (or class) variables, with four levels for treatment and two levels for row side, rather than as continuous variables. This approach was deemed more appropriate since increasing plant density affects more than just leaf area or the number of leaves (or fruit) per unit area of crop row.

term represents four levels of plant density, its deviance was partitioned into linear and nonlinear components (i.e., quadratic and cubic). Here, "nonlinear" refers to the density variable, not the parameters; by definition, Equation 2 is linear in the parameters. A separate Generalized Linear Model (GLM) was fitted to the data from each disease assessment and year.
N is related to treatment since the number of fruit per plot depends on the number of plants per plot.
r was log-transformed prior to ANOVA to stabilize variances. A separate analysis was conducted for each year. The effects of plant density treatment on disease incidence of fruit inoculated in the laboratory and placed within the canopies were assessed with a GLM, employing a logit link function and assuming a binomial distribution. Statistical methods for determining significance were consistent with those used for disease spread.
ln(μ) is the log link function for the GLM. A Poisson distribution was assumed for diseased fruit per plot. In the analyses with Equations 3 and 4, no significant findings were reported for the first rain event, which had an 'index of predicted infection' of 0.15. Average temperatures during the evaluation period were also monitored.
Figure 2: This figure presents the mean proportion of strawberry fruit visibly infected by Colletotrichum acutatum (± standard errors) in relation to distance from the point source of infected fruit across four different plant densities (1 being high and 4 being low). The assessments were conducted at four different times. Within each subplot, solid lines represent the near side of the rows, while dashed lines indicate the far side relative to the initial inoculum source. The inserted numbers provide treatment means with standard errors in parentheses. Notably, for treatment 3 at the third assessment time on the near row side, the mean disease incidence reached 0.93, but this value is truncated due to the common scale across all plots.
Figure 3: This figure showcases examples of the logit transformation of the proportion of strawberry fruit visibly infected by Colletotrichum acutatum in relation to distance from the inoculum point source, along with the predicted logit based on Equation 1. Subfigure A illustrates Treatment 1 at the first disease assessment time, while Subfigure B depicts Treatment 4 at the same assessment time, both in 1992. The solid line represents the near side, and the dashed line corresponds to the far side of the plant rows relative to the initial inoculum source.
The mean temperatures recorded for the four treatment canopies in the 24 hours after the introduction of inoculum were 19.0°C, 19.0°C, 18.8°C, and 19.2°C for treatments 1 through 4, respectively. Over the entire period from inoculum introduction to the last assessment, the average temperatures were 18.5°C, 19.5°C, 18.1°C, and 18.6°C for treatments 1 through 4. In contrast, the mean temperature outside the canopies was 19.7°C. The average number of hours per day of surface wetness ranged from 8.1 to 8.5 for the four treatments and the area outside the row.
In 1993, there was 16 mm of rain immediately following the inoculum placement in the field, with three additional rain events occurring by June 26. The ‘index of predicted infection’ was 0.90 for the first rain. The average temperatures for the 24 hours following the introduction of inoculum and for the entire period were as follows: 17.6°C and 21.2°C, 17.7°C and 21.2°C, 17.8°C and 21.6°C, 19.1°C and 23.0°C, and 19.3°C and 23.2°C for treatments 1 through 4 and the clear area outside the plots, respectively. Mean surface wetness duration per day was 5.0 hours, 6.1 hours, 6.1 hours, 4.8 hours, and 6.7 hours for treatments 1 through 4 and the clear area.
For the initial disease assessment, conducted 9 days after introducing infected fruit into the plots, the mean fruit disease incidence (across all distances and row sides) ranged from 0.13 in treatment 1 (high plant density) to 0.21 in treatment 4 (low density). For subsequent assessments, the mean disease incidence varied between 0.15 and 0.43. Incidence was 1.7 to 2.4 times higher in the lower density treatments compared to the higher density treatments. As anticipated, there was a decline in mean incidence with increasing distance from the inoculum source. For distances close to the inoculum source, incidence on the far side of the plant rows (relative to the source) was generally lower than on the near side for most density treatments and assessment times.
Equation 1 generally provided a good fit for fruit disease incidence in relation to distance. Examples for the near and far row sides of the high (treatment 1) and low (treatment 4) densities during the first assessment are illustrated in Figure 3. The full generalized linear model (GLM) explained 82% to 96% of the deviance (variation) across all assessment times. The main effects of distance (d), row side (S), and their interaction were all significant (P ≤ 0.05), confirming that disease incidence declined with distance and depended on row side. Additionally, the steepness of the disease gradient (slope of Equation 1) was influenced by row side.
Table 1 presents the analysis of deviance for a generalized linear model with a binomial error and logistic link function. For simplicity, subscripts are omitted (e.g., S instead of S_j), and terms are simplified to T × d, S × d, and T × d × S. The table also lists degrees of freedom (df) and the change in deviance from adding each factor or interaction term to the previously listed model. The first line indicates that the previous model contained only the mean (constant). Values marked with an asterisk (*) or double asterisks (**) denote significance at P = 0.05 and P = 0.01, respectively. Values for df or deviance in parentheses reflect a partitioning of treatment deviance into linear and nonlinear components. Linear and nonlinear components were not determined for factors or interactions deemed non-significant (P > 0.05).
The treatment of plant density was significant (P ≤ 0.01) at each assessment time, indicating that it affected disease incidence (see Table 1). An analysis of the Ti deviance into orthogonal components revealed a nonlinear change in disease incidence (P ≤ 0.01) with plant density at three out of four assessment times. This nonlinear effect is evidenced by the low and approximately equal mean values of y for the two higher densities (e.g., y ≈ 0.19 for the third assessment) and the higher mean values of y for the two lower densities (e.g., y ≈ 0.41 for the third assessment) (refer to Fig. 2).
Furthermore, the plant density treatment influenced the steepness of the disease gradients, as shown by the significant interaction between Ti and d (i.e., [bT]id; P ≤ 0.05). However, this effect was also nonlinear. For example, Figure 3 illustrates the different slopes for treatment 1 (3A) and treatment 4 (3B) on the same row side. Additionally, the interaction between Sj and Ti indicated that the influence of row side varied across plant density treatments. Specifically, during the first assessment, the near row side exhibited a higher y value than the far row side, except for the third treatment, where both sides had nearly identical disease incidence (Fig. 2). Notably, a significant three-way interaction was present only at the first assessment time.
Estimates for the intercept (a¢) and slope (b¢) of equation 1 at each time for all combinations of Ti and Sj are presented in Table 2. These estimates derive from the significant terms in equation 2 (Table 1) rather than from individual regressions. Due to various two- and three-way interactions, a¢ and b¢ differ for each combination of treatment and row side. By definition, the different values of a¢ and b¢ shown in Table 2 are significantly different (P ≤ 0.05).
With the exception of the third density treatment (T3), there were instances where a¢ (and thus p0) was higher for the near side (relative to the inoculum source) than for the far side of the plant rows (e.g., 1.7 [p0 ≈ 0.8] versus -0.9 [p0 ≈ 0.3] for treatment 1 at assessment 1). Similarly, b¢ values were greater on the near than far row sides.
Despite the higher mean disease incidence observed with the lower two plant density treatments compared to the higher two (as indicated in the text inserts in subplots in Fig. 2), a¢ values were generally low for the lower plant densities (Table 2). However, b¢ values were also lower (i.e., closer to 0), leading to an overall higher disease incidence for the lower two densities. Using estimates of a¢ and b¢, d10 was calculated and found to be significantly influenced by treatment and row side (Table 2). In general, d10 was consistently higher for the near row sides than for the far row sides; for instance, in the highest plant density at the first assessment, d10 was 159 cm for the near side compared to 69 cm for the far side. At the first assessment, d10 for the near side ranged from 1.2 to 2.3 times larger than for the far side. There was a general increase in d10 with decreasing plant row density; for example, d10 was 152 cm for the near row side of treatment 1 (high density) and 186 cm for treatment 4 (low density) at the fourth assessment time.
The full generalized linear model (GLM) explained 71% to 86% of the deviance across the four assessment times (see Table 1). The main effects of density (d) and side of the row (Sj) were significant (P ≤ 0.01) at all assessment times. However, the interaction between these two factors was not significant (P > 0.10), indicating that the steepness of the disease gradients (i.e., slope [b¢] of equation 1) did not depend on the row side. The variable Ti was significant (P ≤ 0.01) for three of the four assessment times, but its linear component was only significant at the first and last assessment times, where there was a noticeable lower mean incidence in treatment 1 compared to the higher densities (refer to Fig. 4).
For the first assessment time, the only significant interaction was between Ti and Sj (P ≤ 0.01), suggesting that the height of the gradient, but not its steepness, depended on the specific combination of density treatment and row side. In the second assessment, no interactions were significant (see Table 1), meaning that the estimated b¢ remained consistent across all treatments and row sides, while a¢ varied depending on treatment and row side. Since there was no Ti × Sj interaction for assessment time 2, the difference in a¢ between the near and far row sides was consistent across all density treatments (approximately 1.2 in logit scale).
During the third assessment, characterized by a low mean disease incidence, both the Ti and Sj interaction as well as the three-way interaction were significant (see Table 1). This resulted in different estimates of a¢ and b¢ for each combination of density treatment and row side (see Table 2). Nonetheless, a¢ was lower for the far row side compared to the near side. In the last assessment, one significant interaction was observed (P ≤ 0.01), specifically Ti × d [(bT)id], indicating that b¢ estimates varied for each density treatment but not by row side (see Table 2).
Estimates of d10, calculated from a¢ and b¢, were consistently higher for the near row side than for the far side (see Table 2). For example, d10 was 131 cm for the near side and 106 cm for the far side in the high plant density treatment (treatment 1) during the first assessment. Generally, d10 increased with decreasing plant density, although the largest values were recorded in treatment 3 during the last two assessments (e.g., d10 = 245 cm for treatment 3 at assessment time 4).
The analysis of diseased fruit and total fruit showed a highly significant fit (P ≤ 0.01) to the data for each year.
Description of Table 2: Table 2 presents the estimated parameters of the generalized linear model fitted to the proportion of fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum across four disease assessments over two years. Each row represents different treatment groups categorized by the side of the row (near or far) and includes parameters such as a¢ (the predicted logit at distance d = 0), b¢ (the steepness of the gradient), and d10 (the predicted distance at which the infection probability declines to 0.10). The values indicate that treatment 1 has lower incidence rates compared to higher density treatments. For instance, it lists various estimates for each treatment, showing that as plant density decreases, d10 tends to increase, with maximum values found in treatment 3 during the last assessments.
There was a significant relationship (P ≤ 0.01) between the total number of diseased fruits per plot and nitrogen (N) levels (Fig. 5A), with equation 4 providing an acceptable fit to the data. The number of diseased fruits increased with N, although the most substantial changes occurred at low N levels. For over three-quarters of the N range, there was little change in the number of diseased fruits with increasing fruit density. Since experimental factors were not considered (as with equation 3), considerable variation was observed around the curves.
Rain Attenuation: In 1992, the plant density treatment significantly affected (P ≤ 0.01) the (transformed) proportion of rain that penetrated the row canopy (Fig. 6). Both linear and nonlinear components were significant (P ≤ 0.01), reflecting a large increase in the proportion from treatment 3 to treatment 4 (lowest plant density). Additionally, rain episode (Ek; i.e., time) also had a significant effect (P ≤ 0.01) on the proportion (data not shown). Both the linear and nonlinear components of time were significant (P ≤ 0.05), indicating that the proportion of rain intercepted depended on individual rain episodes, although this proportion generally declined over time (data not shown).
Discussion: The spread of anthracnose fruit rot was observed in strawberry plots over two years by determining disease gradients in relation to the distance from introduced point sources of Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum. Disease spread was strongly influenced by the canopy, as evidenced by the significant effect of canopy row side (relative to the inoculum source) and plant density treatment on the height and steepness of the disease gradients. The near side overall exhibited a higher disease incidence than the far row side, and there was generally a negative but nonlinear relationship between plant density and disease incidence.
In the study, significant results were found regarding spore deposition influenced by plant density. Specifically, the total number of spores deposited in samplers increased as plant density decreased from 100% to 50% of the maximum density tested. Beyond this point, the number of deposited spores either decreased or remained constant with further reductions in plant density. The findings from the field study align with the rain simulation experiments, indicating a clear nonlinear relationship between disease response (mean y, a¢, b¢, and d10) and plant density.
In 1992, the mean disease incidence was low and similar for the two highest plant density treatments, while it was high and comparable for the two lower densities. By 1993, the mean disease incidence at the highest density (treatment 1) remained low but reached its maximum at the next to lowest density (treatment 3). Notably, d10 reached its largest value at this same plant density (treatment 3). Unlike the rain simulation studies, this field investigation focused on disease development rather than solely on spore dispersal. Nonetheless, we suspect that variations in dispersal significantly contribute to the observed effects.
Post-deposition infection of fruit—specifically, fruit inoculated in the laboratory and placed within canopies—was influenced by the plant density treatment in only one of three tests during a single evaluation year. In the significant result, we noted the relationship between the absolute numbers of diseased fruit per plot (totaled across all distances and row sides) and the total number of fruit per plot (N), as well as the mean proportion of diseased fruit per plot (incidence) relative to N for the years 1992 and 1993.
Additionally, the mean proportion of incident rain (± standard errors) penetrating strawberry canopies across four densities (1 [high] to 4 [low]) in both years was assessed. Rain (ml cm–2) within the canopy was divided by the rain (ml cm–2) over an open area to calculate proportions of the incident. The models used for analysis employed a log link function for expected diseased fruit and a logit link function for the probability of being diseased. The deviance values were recorded as follows: A, 28.8 (1992) and 37.3 (1993); and B, 52.5 (1992) and 42.1 (1993).

Additionally, this choice aligned with our goal of ensuring the statistical model corresponded with the previously developed logistic disease spread model for a single plot.

=1/e≈0.37) for the exponential model.
The rate of increase in diseased fruit corresponds with rising nitrogen (N) levels. There was a decline in disease incidence (y) as N increased (Fig. 5B), consistent with the observed trend of decreasing mean y with higher plant density (Figs. 2 and 4) and the results from the full generalized linear model (GLM) presented in Tables 1 and 2. For the epidemiological theory proposed by Anderson and May to be fully applicable, there must be enough generations (within a single season or over several years, depending on the pathosystem) for the disease to reach equilibrium or asymptotic intensity. This necessitates time for multiple generations of plant-to-plant (or fruit-to-fruit) spread. However, many economically significant diseases are monocyclic, at least within a single year, and it remains unclear from the limited empirical evidence available how plant density influences these circumstances. Increasing plant density will heighten the likelihood of a propagule coming into contact with a plant unit adjacent to the source of the propagules. However, at greater distances, increased density may also create more barriers (per unit area) between propagules and plant units.
Even directly adjacent to the source, density effects are uncertain. As noted previously, while increasing density might lead to more units becoming infected, the rising total number of units could result in a constant or even decreasing proportion of diseased units. There is clear evidence from certain systems that the dispersal of spores or other microscopic particles, such as pollen, diminishes as plant density increases. Interestingly, recent studies showing no correlation between plant density and disease in natural systems have focused on heteroecious rusts, which do not have secondary spread. Therefore, any observed effects would likely be due to altered dispersal dynamics associated with increased density or changes in environmental conditions.
In the case of day-length-sensitive strawberry cultivars (which produce one generation of fruit per season) and with an approximately 6 to 9-day latent period for anthracnose, there is limited time for multiple generations. Consequently, the disease being investigated may function more like a monocyclic disease than a polycyclic one, particularly when ripe fruit are harvested.
It is well established that surface topography (e.g., surface random roughness) significantly influences rain-splash dispersal of fungal plant pathogens. Increased surface roughness can often counteract the effects of increased rain quantity or intensity on spore dispersal. For example, straw mulch, commonly used in perennial strawberry production, substantially reduces disease spread in the field. In this study, increasing plant density produced a qualitatively similar effect to increased surface roughness, although the impact of plant density changes was less pronounced. While altering density alone may not suffice to manage diseases like anthracnose, it could be combined with other practices to enhance disease control. Moreover, density effects are directly relevant to the use of cultivar mixtures for controlling anthracnose and other diseases.
