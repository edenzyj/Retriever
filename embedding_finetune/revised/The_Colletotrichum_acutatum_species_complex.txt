Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa—spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions—confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.

INTRODUCTION: As a significant pathogen, C. acutatum has been treated as a regulated organism for many years.
C. acutatum, as noted by various studies (Peres et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2007; Talhinhas et al. 2011; Polashock et al. 2009; Wharton & Schilder 2008), has a well-known morphological feature: the shape of its conidia, which are characterized by acute ends (Simmonds 1965). However, other conidial shapes are frequently encountered, particularly cylindrical forms with only one acute end. These variations are often observed in strains that have been repeatedly subcultured, as well as in the “terminal crook” disease of pine (Dingley & Gilmour 1972) and in the anthracnose affecting leather leaf fern (Schiller et al. 2006). There are also reports of disseminated infections in sea turtles (Manire et al. 2002) and infections in scale insects (Marcelino et al. 2008). Differentiating between C. acutatum (s. lat.) and C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is challenging due to the existence of many intermediate strains that exhibit a limited number of typical fusiform conidia alongside numerous cylindrical ones (Van der Aa et al. 1990).
On strawberry plants, C. acutatum primarily causes black spot disease on the fruit but can also affect crowns, roots, and leaves (Freeman & Katan 1997), making it one of the most serious diseases in commercial fruit production. The conidia are formed in acervuli on the host, while in culture, they can also be produced in the aerial mycelium (Johnston & Jones 1997). C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on living strawberry leaves, stimulated by extracts from the strawberry plant, especially flower extracts (Leandro et al. 2001; Leandro et al. 2003). According to Buddie et al. (1999), secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia, and these are generally smaller and more variable in shape, which can obscure the differences between taxa. Additionally, C. acutatum forms simple pigmented appressoria but has few or no setae (Simmonds 1965).

At this point, it was widely presumed that C. acutatum was a species complex containing several constituent taxa. However, there was substantial reluctance to recognize the clades involved as independent species due to the lack of distinctive morphological and cultural characters. For example, C. lupini was not formally recognized as separate from C. acutatum by Talhinhas et al. (2002) or by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005). Some attempts were made to address these concerns through the adoption of formae speciales, such as C. acutatum f. sp. pineum (Dingley & Gilmour 1972), C. acutatum f. sp. hakeae (Lubbe et al. 2004), and C. acutatum f. sp. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008). However, this mechanism for recognizing pathology-related taxa is now rarely used.
Gradually, separate species began to be recognized as part of the C. acutatum species complex, such as C. lupini (Nirenberg et al. 2002) and C. phormii (Farr et al. 2006). In a study using two genes, ITS and TUB2, along with morphological data, Shivas & Tan (2009) recognized three distinct groups within C. acutatum strains from Australia and accepted two new species, C. simmondsii and C. fioriniae (formerly C. acutatum f. sp. fioriniae) for groups A2 and A3. Recently, a new species was described for group A4, C. clavatum (Faedda et al. 2011).
Our research aims to present a comprehensive revision of the C. acutatum species complex. We thoroughly survey the constituent taxa and delineate additional species where needed. We have examined a large number of C. acutatum s. lat. strains, isolated from various hosts and geographic areas. Multi-locus molecular analysis serves as the basis for species recognition, although morphological and cultural characters allowing alternative means of species recognition are provided where possible.
A total of 331 strains were studied, primarily identified as C. acutatum, along with other related strains from the CBS, IMI, and other culture collections. Type material (holotypes and epitypes) of the species studied is housed in the Herbarium of the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands; the IMI Fungarium at the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (IMI and K(M)), UK; the US National Fungus Collections (BPI), Beltsville, Maryland, USA; the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem, Freie Universität Berlin (B), Germany; and the dried collection of the Botanische Staatssammlung München (M), Germany. All descriptions are based on the ex-type, ex-epitype, or ex-neotype culture as appropriate. Features of other strains are included if they differ significantly. Subcultures of the types, epitypes, and neotypes, as well as all other isolates used for morphological and sequence analyses, are maintained in the culture collections of CBS and IMI.
To enhance sporulation, autoclaved filter paper and double-autoclaved stems of Anthriscus sylvestris were placed onto the surface of synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976). SNA and oatmeal agar (OA; Crous et al. 2009) cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements and photographs of characteristic structures were taken according to Damm et al. (2007). Appressoria on hyphae were observed on the reverse side of SNA plates. Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure, and observed using a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope or a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. In the C. acutatum species complex, conidia are usually formed in acervular conidiomata and additionally in the aerial mycelium. Unless stated otherwise, only conidia from conidiomata were used for morphological examination.
Genomic DNA from the isolates was extracted using the method described by Damm et al. (2008). The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene, along with two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), histone 3 (HIS3), actin (ACT), and beta-tubulin (TUB2) genes were amplified and sequenced. The primer pairs used included ITS-1F (Gardes & Bruns 1993) + ITS-4 (White et al. 1990) or V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) + ITS-4, GDF1 + GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003), CHS-354R + CHS-79F (Carbone & Kohn 1999), CYLH3F + CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b), ACT-512F + ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), and BT2Fd + BT4R (Woudenberg et al. 2009) or T1 (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997) + Bt-2b (Glass & Donaldson 1995).
The PCRs were conducted in a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) with a total volume of 12.5 μL. The PCR mixture for GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3, ACT, and TUB2 included 1 μL of 20x diluted genomic DNA, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1x PCR buffer (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany), 2 mM MgCl₂, 20 μM of each dNTP, 0.7 μL DMSO, and 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline). The conditions for PCR included an initial denaturation step of 5 minutes at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94 °C, 30 seconds at 52 °C, and 30 seconds at 72 °C, concluding with a final denaturation step of 7 minutes at 72 °C. The ITS PCR was performed as described by Woudenberg et al. (2009). The DNA sequences generated with forward and reverse primers were used to obtain consensus sequences using Bionumerics v. 4.60 (Applied Maths, St-Marthens-Lathem, Belgium), with the alignment assembled and manually adjusted using Sequence Alignment Editor v. 2.0a11 (Rambaut 2002).
Figure 1 illustrates one of the 830 most parsimonious trees obtained from a heuristic search of the combined sequences of the aforementioned genes. Bootstrap support values above 70% (in bold) and Bayesian posterior probability values above 0.95 are indicated at the nodes. Colletotrichum orchidophilum strains serve as outgroups. Ex-holotype, ex-neotype, and ex-epitype strains are emphasized in bold, with strain numbers followed by substrate (host genus) and country of origin. Branches crossed by diagonal lines are shortened by 50%. Groups defined by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) are highlighted in red, while mtDNA RFLP haplotypes from Guerber et al. (2003) are highlighted in blue.
Random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) were utilized as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing data, and all characters were considered unordered and of equal weight. No more than 10 trees with a score (length) of 10 or greater were saved in each replicate. The robustness of the trees obtained was evaluated through 10,000 bootstrap replications using the Fast-stepwise addition algorithm (Hillis & Bull, 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting trees. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was employed to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003) for the combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene, determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3, were applied to each gene partition. The analyses of two MCMC chains were initiated from random trees for 1,000,000 generations, sampling every 100 generations. The likelihood scores of the two runs were 2,500 and 2,200, leading to the discarding of the first 2,350 trees (the average of both) as the burn-in phase of the analysis, with posterior probabilities determined from the remaining trees. For additional comparison, a Neighbor-Joining analysis was performed on the multigene alignment using PAUP and 1,000 bootstrap replications. Sequences derived in this study have been submitted to GenBank, the alignment is available in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html), and taxonomic novelties have been lodged in MycoBank (Crous et al., 2004a).
The six sequence datasets showed no conflicts in tree topology for the 70% reciprocal bootstrap trees, which allowed us to...
The text appears to reference a detailed list of sequences and their associated identifiers, likely summarizing results from the phylogenetic analysis. The list includes multiple entries, each detailing a unique identifier (e.g., CBS numbers), species names (e.g., Fragaria, Protea, Capsicum), and their geographical origins (e.g., Italy, Mexico, USA). Some entries include annotations indicating additional taxonomic details or statuses, like "unknown" for species identification. There are also numeric codes that may represent sample information or specific data points related to each sequence. This structured data suggests a comprehensive effort to catalog and analyze genetic material across various species, highlighting the diversity and distribution of these organisms.
In a study of the multigene analyses (gene boundaries: ITS: 1–546, GAPDH: 557–829, CHS-1: 840–1121, HIS3: 1131–1519, ACT: 1530–1786, TUB2: 1797–2290) involving 330 isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum and related species, including outgroup strains (C. orchidophilum, CBS 631.80, CBS 632.80, CBS 119291, IMI 309357), a total of 2290 characters, including alignment gaps, were processed. Among these, 468 characters were parsimony-informative, 65 were parsimony-uninformative, and 1757 were constant. One strain, CBS 436.77 (C. pseudoacutatum), was excluded from the analysis presented in Figure 1. Following a heuristic search using PAUP, 830 most parsimonious trees were retained (length = 1008 steps, CI = 0.643, RI = 0.981, RC = 0.681, HI = 0.357). The topology of these trees was similar, confirmed by a substantial selection of them, differing only in the positioning of taxa within subclades. For Bayesian analysis, the following models were chosen: HKY+I for ITS, HKY+G for GAPDH and TUB2, K80+I+G for CHS-1, HKY+I+G for HIS3, and GTR+G for ACT. The consensus tree obtained from Bayesian analyses and the NJ tree (not shown) corroborated the topology derived from parsimony, with Bayesian posterior probability values aligning with bootstrap supports.
There are additional strains associated with other plant families, including Grevillea from Germany, Vaccinium from the Netherlands and the USA, and various Fragaria and Aspalathus strains from Australia and South Africa. The data includes numerous samples with varying confidence values, reflecting the complex relationships among these species.
The analyses resulted in the detection of five main clades and numbers beginning with A) and Guerber et al. (2003) identified 29 subclades within C. acutatum s. lat., which we accept as RFLP haplotypes, with numbers beginning with C…K. These represent different Colletotrichum species. The corresponding differential and comparable studies are listed in brackets below, as indicated in the phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1).
The first clade is well supported, with a bootstrap support of 100% and a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. It consists of two frequently isolated, well-supported clades (both with bootstrap support/Bayesian posterior probability of 100/1.00), comprising several strains each, representing C. lupini (A1, J2/J6) and C. tamarilloi (A8). Other less frequently encountered subclades in the first clade include C. costaricense (94/1.00), with two strains, and both C. cuscutae and C. melonis, each represented by single-strain clades on long branches, along with several short-branched single-strain clades, including the known species C. limetticola (J3) and six further unnamed strains.
The majority of strains in clade 2 (A2, 86/1.00) belong to C. nymphaeae (98/1.00, D2/D4), while most of the other 11 subclades of this clade are occupied by only one or a few strains. The clade representing C. scovillei (99/1.00) consists of three strains and groups (98/1.00) with a single-strain clade formed by additional strains.
C. simmondsii (99/1.00), C. chrysanthemi (100/1.00), C. paxtonii (99/1.00), C. laticiphilum (99/1.00), C. cosmi, C. walleri, C. sloanei, C. indonesiense, and C. brisbanense represent single-strain clades. Clades 3 and 4 are well-supported (100/1.00 and 100/0.87) and are positioned on long branches, representing C. fioriniae (A3, C1/C2/C3) and C. acutatum (A5, J4), respectively. Clade 5 comprises two sister clades. Colletotrichum godetiae (A4, F1*, 99/1.00), formed by a large number of strains, belongs to the first sister clade and groups (97/1.00) with C. johnstonii (F8, 100/1.00) and a single-strain clade representing C. pyricola (F2). The other sister clade (75/1.00) consists of six subclades: a large, long-branched, and nearly homogenous subclade representing C. salicis (A7, K1, 100/1.00); a short-branched subclade representing C. phormii (91/1.00); C. rhombiforme (A6, 100/1.00), which groups with a single-strain clade representing C. acerbum on a long branch (F1*, 100/1.00); along with C. australe (100/1.00) and C. kinghornii, both on long branches. Strains labeled F1 appear in the phylogeny of Guerber et al. (2003) in different subclades corresponding to C. acerbum, C. godetiae, and probably also C. rhombiforme.
Colletotrichum pseudoacutatum is only distantly related to the C. acutatum complex and is therefore not included in the phylogeny, while C. orchidophilum was found to be more closely related and was used as an outgroup. The phylogenetic positions of these and all other species included here are illustrated in Figures 1 and 2 of Cannon et al. (2012, this issue).
The individual alignments and maximum parsimony analyses of the six single genes were compared regarding their performance in species recognition. With ITS and CHS-1, only 11 and 13 species can be recognized, respectively. All subclades are recognized with TUB2 and GAPDH. TUB2 performs better than GAPDH due to a higher number of base pair differences; however, even with TUB2, there are clades with differences of only 1 bp, suggesting that both genes should be used for identification. The performance of the other two genes is intermediate between ITS and TUB2/GAPDH.
Based on DNA sequence data and morphology, the 331 strains studied are assigned to 31 species, of which 29 species are within the C. acutatum species complex, and two are outside this group, including 21 species that have been found to be new to science. Two species formed sexual morphs in vitro. All species studied in culture are characterized below.
Colletotrichum acerbum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800494.
Etymology: acerbus is Latin for bitter, referring to bitter rot, the vernacular name for Colletotrichum disease of apple.

3.8. Appressoria are present either singly or in loose groups, medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, with a clavate, ovate, or irregular outline. The edges can be entire or undulate and sometimes lobate, measuring (8–)9–14(–16.5) × (4–)5–7.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.3 ± 2.4 × 6.2 ± 1.2 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.8.
The asexual morph occurs on the stem of Anthriscus. The conidiomata are acervular, and conidiophores develop on a cushion of pale brown angular cells, measuring 3–8.5 µm in diameter. Setae are few, medium brown, with the basal cell being pale, smooth-walled, 1–2-septate, 45–85 µm long, cylindrical at the base with a diameter of 3–4 µm, and having a tip that is ± acute. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 30 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 9–20 × 3.5–5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette of 0.5–1 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, with one end rounded and the other slightly acute, measuring (12.5–)15–18.5(–20.5) × (4–)4.5–5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.8 ± 1.7 × 4.7 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.6.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, ranging from hyaline to pale cinnamon. On filter paper and Anthriscus stems, the medium is partly covered with short floccose-felty white aerial mycelium and salmon, orange to olivaceous grey acervuli. The reverse displays the same colors, with a growth rate of 20–21.5 mm in 7 days (32–33 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with entire margins; the surface is buff to honey and almost entirely covered with floccose-felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, along with olivaceous grey to salmon acervuli. The reverse is buff, pale olivaceous grey, grey olivaceous to iron-grey, showing a growth rate of 17.5–20 mm in 7 days (27.5–30 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Material Examined: New Zealand, Nelson, collected from bitter rot on the fruit of Malus domestica on August 1, 1987, by P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20725 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128530 = ICMP 12921 = PRJ 1199.3).
Notes: Bitter rot has been considered an economically significant disease of apple for many years (Schrenk & Spaulding, 1903b) and was initially attributed to Gloeosporium fructigenum (Berkeley, 1856). However, Berkeley’s type was examined by Vinnere (2004) and found to contain falcate conidia, excluding it from the C. acutatum species complex. Currently, bitter rot is primarily known to be caused by fungi from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (González et al., 2006). That study focused on strains from the USA and Brazil, and it remains unclear whether their C. acutatum s. lat. strains are conspecific with C. acerbum. Strains from Lee et al. (2007) in Korea belong to C. acutatum clades 2 (including C. nymphaeae and related species) and 3 (including C. fioriniae), indicating that the host may be susceptible to a wide range of Colletotrichum pathogens.
The ex-type strain of C. acerbum is the only strain included in this study that represents the C. acutatum group B, as defined by Lardner et al. (1999). It may be common on Malus in New Zealand, but Lardner et al. (1999) noted that more strains from fruit rot of apple, as well as from feijoa and fig, belong to group C and display similar RAPD banding patterns. It is possible that their group C contains multiple species. The GAPDH sequence of strain PJ9 (which is PRJ 819 in Lardner et al. 1999), isolated from apple in New Zealand and sequenced by Guerber et al. (2003), is identical to that of CBS 128530, the ex-type strain of C. acerbum.

Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–5.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores are formed directly on vegetative hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly simple, sometimes septate and branched, up to 25 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slightly inflated, often not clearly separated from subtending hyphae by a septum, measuring 3.5–20 × 2–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter. The collarette is distinct, measuring 1–1.5 µm long, and the periclinal thickening is conspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, measuring (7.5–) 11–14.5(–19) × 3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.6 ± 1.8 × 3.9 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.2. Conidia from strains CBS 112759, CBS 112979, and CBS 979.69 differ by being cylindrical to clavate, with one round and one acute end. For example, conidia of strain CBS 112759 are smaller, measuring (6.5–) 8.5–12(–13) × (2.5–) 3–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.3 ± 1.9 × 3.4 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.1. Appressoria are solitary, medium brown, smooth-walled, ellipsoidal to obovate, with an entire edge, sometimes undulate, measuring (4–) 5.5–9(–13) × (3–) 4–6.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.3 ± 2.0 × 5.4 ± 1.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.3.
The asexual morph is found on the Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores formed on a cushion of pale brown angular cells measuring 2–7 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, septate, branched, and smooth-walled, up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 9–18 × 3–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a distinct collarette of 0.5 µm long, and conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, fusiform to cylindrical, with uniformly acute apex and base, measuring (8.5–) 12–16.5(–17.5) × (3–) 3.5–4.5(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.3 ± 2.1 × 4.1 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.5. Conidia from strains CBS 112759, CBS 370.73, and CBS 112979 differ by being cylindrical to clavate and having one round and one acute end. Conidia of strain CBS 370.73 are smaller, measuring (5–) 6.5–11(–12.5) × (2–) 2.5–3.5(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.8 ± 2.1 × 3.2 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline with white aerial mycelium on the Anthriscus stem and filter paper; the reverse of the filter paper is partly pale ochreous. The growth rate is 21–24.5 mm in 7 days (30–36.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is buff, rosy buff, salmon to peach due to sporulation, with olivaceous sectors in the center, partly covered by white floccose aerial mycelium. The reverse is rosy buff to flesh, smoke grey to olivaceous grey in the center, with a growth rate of 20–25 mm in 7 days (31–33.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are saffron to orange.
Notes: Colletotrichum acutatum was described by Simmonds (1965) from a range of different hosts in Australia. No type was designated at that time, but the name was validated three years later (Simmonds 1968) with the designation of a holotype, IMI 117617 from Carica papaya, and paratypes from C. papaya (IMI 117618 - IMI 117621), Capsicum frutescens (IMI 117622), and Delphinium sp. (IMI 117623).
Vinnere et al. (2002) sequenced the ITS region of the holotype specimen (AF411700) and one paratype specimen (IMI 117619, AF411701). They found morphological and cultural differences among Simmonds’s six holotype/paratype specimens of C. acutatum. While no living ex-holotype culture is available, two ex-paratype strains exist in a living state: one from Carica papaya (IMI 117620 = QDPI&F plant disease log book no. 16633D = ATCC 56816 = CBS 112996 = STE-U 5292) and one from Capsicum frutescens (IMI 117622 = QDPI&F plant disease log book no. 11711A = CBS 292.67). Additionally, there is an ex-topotype strain from Carica papaya (QDPI&F plant disease log book no. 13483-0 = CBS 294.67).
Than et al. (2008b) epitypified C. acutatum with a strain from Carica papaya from the region where the species was first collected (BRIP 28519 = CBS 122122). This action was inadvisable, given the existence of living cultures from two paratypes, and it was later found that their epitype was not conspecific with the type. Following an ITS and TUB2 analysis of the clade, Shivas & Tan (2009) described C. acutatum sensu Than et al. (2008b) as a separate species, C. simmondsii. They did not designate an additional epitype for C. acutatum, but since only the ITS region of the holotype was sequenced, we believe it is important to establish the application of that species name with an appropriate epitype subject to multigene analysis. This has been accomplished, with one of Simmonds’s original paratypes chosen for this purpose.
Colletotrichum acutatum s. str. causes diseases in a wide range of unrelated plants, some of which are economically significant, including Carica papaya, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), pine (Pinus spp.), Hakea spp., and rooibos (Aspalathus linearis). Two of these are associated with formae speciales, which are not recognized as a taxonomic rank in the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (ICN), as they are based on fungus/plant interactions rather than single species. Consequently, formal ICN-compliant taxa cannot use formae speciales as basionyms for new combinations.
Colletotrichum acutatum f. sp. pinea (Dingley & Gilmour 1972) was described for a malady of pines known as terminal crook disease, with the fungus apparently causing malformation of growing tips. We have examined authentic cultures derived from Dingley & Gilmour’s work, which were also used by von Arx. Most of these cultures cannot be distinguished morphologically or molecularly from C. acutatum s. str., but strain CBS 436.77 (from Chile, not from New Zealand as are the authentic cultures of C. acutatum f. sp. pinea) belongs to a distinctly different species outside of the C. acutatum species complex (see C. pseudoacutatum). CBS 797.72 appears to show evidence of hybrid origin and is not included in the molecular analyses (see below).
A variety of C. acutatum, described on Fiorinia externa (a scale insect), C. acutatum var. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008), was recognized as a separate species, C. fioriniae, by Shivas & Tan (2009) and is included in this study.
A sexual morph was described for C. acutatum (Guerber & Correll 1997, 2001), based on mating-compatible strains in the laboratory. The cross designated as the type of Glomerella acutata was based on two cultures, ATCC 56816 and ATCC MYA-662. The first of these is derived from one of Simmonds’ original Queensland collections from papaya, IMI 117620, which is here designated as the epitype of C. acutatum. However, there is ongoing confusion regarding the provenance of this strain; Guerber & Correll (2001) and Than et al. (2008b) incorrectly equated ATCC 56816 with IMI 117617, the holotype, and this congruence is recorded as such in the ATCC catalog. The second strain, ATCC MYA-662, was isolated from apple in Louisiana, USA (Guerber & Correll 2001), and is assigned here to C. fioriniae in clade 3. Fertile sexual morphs were also produced by Guerber & Correll (2001) and Guerber et al. (2003) by mating a series of different strains, including crosses between parents both assigned to C. fioriniae. None of the strains tested was self-fertile.
The holotype of Glomerella acutata is therefore an interspecific hybrid between C. acutatum and C. fioriniae. This may be construed as strong evidence that these two taxa constitute a single biological species, suggesting that the species concepts used in this paper are too narrow. However, the parent strains of the holotype originate from geographically distant populations, and there are instances in other fungal groups (e.g., Neurospora) where non-sympatric populations lose post-mating reproductive isolation barriers (Turner et al. 2010, 2011). Further research on population structures and mating-type barriers would be instructive.
Colletotrichum acutatum has subsequently been reported to produce a sexual morph in nature, on Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush blueberry) in Norway (Talgø et al. 2007). Sequence-based identification was apparently not carried out, so the identity of this population remains uncertain; however, the blueberry pathogen is usually C. fioriniae, which has a known sexual morph (Marcelino et al. 2008). Its origin is also unknown; the crop is not native to Norway, and the fungus may have been introduced from the USA along with planting material. The Glomerella sexual morph described from Acer platanoides in Massachusetts, USA, is homothallic (LoBuglio & Pfister 2008) and belongs to C. salicis, not C. acutatum s. str. Two strains from this research are included in our study. Further discussion may be found in Cannon et al. (2012, this issue).
A further twist in the story may be provided by CBS 797.72; this is one of the strains on which C. acutatum f. sp. pinea was based (Dingley & Gilmour 1972). Sequences of three of the six genes sampled (ACT, HIS3, and CHS-1) indicate affinities with C. acutatum (clade 4), but the other three (ITS, GAPDH, and TUB2) suggest that the strain belongs to C. fioriniae (clade 3). This was confirmed by repeating sequencing from a new subculture from the CBS collection and after re-singlesporing one of the single spore isolates. This too may be of hybrid origin. The phylogeny by Guerber et al. (2003) includes strains from Pinus in New Zealand in both species (as groups J4 and C1). We do not know if they should be assigned to C. fioriniae, or if they are hybrids as well.
Apart from C. acutatum and C. simmondsii, several other species of Colletotrichum and Gloeosporium have been described on Carica papaya, all from Brazil. The conidia of C. papayae Henn., described from branches and petioles of papaya in São Paulo, are larger and differ in shape from C. acutatum sensu stricto; they are cylindrical, straight to curved, hyaline, and measure 12–20 × 5–7 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931), whereas those of C. acutatum measure on average 8.8–15.5 × 3.2–4.5 µm, depending on strain and medium. Gloeosporium papayae Henn., described from stems of papaya in Uberaba, Minas Gerais, forms cylindrical-oblong to subclavate, obtuse, straight, hyaline to pale yellowish conidia that measure 11–14 × 5–6 µm (Hennings 1895); the conidia of C. acutatum are hyaline and broader. A presumed isotype in K(M) of G. papayae, “E. Ule n. 1947”, collected in June 1892, is actually a species of Phomopsis. Gloeosporium fructus-caricae Henn. forms conidia that overlap in size with those of C. acutatum; however, their shape is described as oblong-cylindrical with both ends rounded, while the conidia of C. acutatum usually have both ends acute. Even if the description completely matches that of C. acutatum, we cannot be certain they are the same species; the morphology of most species in the C. acutatum species complex is highly variable and overlapping. There is no strain from papaya in Brazil included in this study, and no report of C. acutatum sensu lato from Brazil is listed in Farr & Rossman (2012). We have tried to strike a reasonable balance between respecting the rules of priority and ensuring nomenclatural stability, and in this case, we feel that Simmonds’ name should be conserved if such a synonymy is established.
Colletotrichum acutatum is differentiated from other species by all genes. The closest matches in a BLASTn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 112996, showing 100% identity, were GU183307–GU183309 and GU183311–GU183314, from Boronia, Anemone, Fragaria, Pistacia, Olea, Ranunculus, and Mangifera in Australia (Shivas & Tan 2009), FJ788419 from Simmonds’ specimen 16633D from Carica papaya in Australia (Weir & Johnston, unpubl. data), AY376546–AY376549 and AY376558–AY376568 from Pinus, Leucadendron, and Carica (STE-U 5292 = CBS 112996) and Hakea (Lubbe et al. 2004), AJ748627 and AJ748630 from Phlox and Statice (Talhinhas et al. 2005), HE573032 from Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree) (Polizzi et al. 2011), and with 99% identity (1 or 2 bp difference) AY376550 and AY376545 from Protea and Leucospermum (Lubbe et al. 2004) and AJ748618 from Olea (Talhinhas et al. 2005). Therefore, Colletotrichum acutatum sensu stricto can be assumed to be a widespread species that causes disease symptoms on a wide range of plants.
Colletotrichum australe Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800495. Fig. 4.
Etymology: derived from the localities of collection in the Southern Hemisphere.
Conidiomata are acervular where present, with conidiophores and setae formed directly on hyphae or on a cushion of pale brown angular cells. Setae are pale to medium brown, smooth-walled to finely verruculose, 2–7-septate, measuring 40–130 µm long. The base is cylindrical to conical, 3–5 µm in diameter, with tips that are broadly rounded to somewhat acute, which may function as a conidiogenous locus. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and little branched, up to 50 µm long.
Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 8–19 × 3–5 µm, with an opening of 1–2.5 µm in diameter and a collarette of 0.5–1 µm. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, sometimes slightly constricted in the middle, with one end rounded and the other slightly acute to truncate. Their dimensions are (16–)17–20(–22) × (4–)4.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 18.6 ± 1.6 × 4.7 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.0. Conidia from strain CBS 131325 are smaller, measuring (13.5–)15–17.5(–18) × (3.5–)4–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.3 ± 1.1 × 4.4 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.7.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to honey, and range from filter paper straw to pale olivaceous grey, lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse is the same colors, with a growth rate of 16–18 mm in 7 days (28.5–30 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is pale luteous to amber, and the center is covered with floccose white aerial mycelium. The reverse is pale luteous to salmon, with a growth rate of 16–20 mm in 7 days (25–29.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear salmon in mass.
South Africa, Stellenbosch, university campus, from Trachycarpus fortunei, 2 Jan. 1998, J.E. Taylor (CBS-H 20721 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 116478 = HKUCC2616).
Australia, Western Australia, Alcoa, from Hakea sp., 12 Jul. 2011, W. Gams, culture CBS 131325.
Notes: Colletotrichum australe belongs to a clade that includes C. phormii, C. kinghornii, C. rhombiforme, and C. acerbum. Setae are better developed in cultures on Anthriscus stems, and conidia are larger than in most other species in the C. acutatum species complex. Only C. phormii forms larger conidia, which are fusiform, whereas those of C. australe are cylindrical. Additionally, appressoria of C. australe are shorter than those of C. phormii, while conidia of C. rhombiforme are shorter, and those of C. kinghornii are narrower.
Colletotrichum australe is distinguished from other species by all gene sequences surveyed, except for CHS-1, which is identical to that of C. phormii. It is most effectively separated by the HIS3 sequence. The closest match in a BLASTn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 116478 (with 98% identity and 8 to 9 base pair differences) included isolates PCF 459 (EU635504) from strawberry in Belgium (Debode et al. 2009) and PT250 (= CBS 129953, see C. rhombiforme), as well as AJ748624 from olive in Portugal (Talhinhas et al. 2005). None of these sequences appear to be derived from strains conspecific with C. australe. The closest match for the GAPDH sequence showed no identity higher than 87%. The closest matches with the ITS sequence (99% identity) include Glomerella cingulata BBA 70991 from Salix (AJ301952, Nirenberg et al. 2002) and Glomerella sp. strain MP3 from Acer platanoides (EU622052, LoBuglio & Pfister 2008), both likely belonging to C. salicis. Other strains with 99% ITS sequence homology include that deposited as Fusarium phormii strain CBS 198.35 (DQ286144, Farr et al. 2006), which we assign to C. kinghornii, and Ga. acutata PT715 from Olea europaea in Portugal (AM991135, Talhinhas et al. 2009).
Colletotrichum brisbanense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800497.
Etymology: Named after Brisbane, the city in Queensland, Australia, where the species was collected.
Sexual morph not observed. The asexual morph is found on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–8 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are not developed, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 30 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slightly inflated, sometimes lacking a basal septum and continuous with the conidiophore. They can proliferate and extend to form a new conidiogenous locus; discrete phialides measure 8.5–21 × 2.5–4 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, featuring distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, with both ends slightly acute or one end rounded and the other slightly acute, measuring (12–)12–17.5(–25) × (3–)3.5–4(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.8 ± 2.8 × 3.8 ± 0.5 µm and a length/width ratio of 3.9. Appressoria are single or in loose groups, pale brown, smooth-walled, mostly clavate, with entire to undulate edges, measuring (5–)7.5–14.5(–18) × (2.5–)3.5–5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.1 ± 3.4 × 4.3 ± 0.9 µm and a length/width ratio of 2.6.
The asexual morph is observed on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are possibly acervular, but no basal cells were observed. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, sometimes proliferating and extending to form a new conidiogenous locus, occasionally polyphialidic, measuring 8.5–23 × 2.5–4.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette of 0.5–1 µm long, featuring distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with both ends slightly acute, measuring (9.5–)12–15(–17) × (3–)3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.5 ± 1.4 × 3.9 ± 0.3 µm and a length/width ratio of 3.5.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to pale cinnamon, on filter paper partly pale saffron, and the agar medium is partly covered with very short white aerial mycelium.
Growth rate: 18–20 mm in 7 days (26–29 mm in 10 days). Colonies on oatmeal agar (OA) are flat with an entire margin; the surface color varies from buff and rosy buff to pale saffron, covered with short white aerial mycelium, and the reverse exhibits the same colors. The growth rate is slightly lower at 17.5–18.5 mm in 7 days (27.5–28.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon-colored.
Material Examined: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, Eight Mile Plains, from fruit rot of Capsicum annuum, 14 Jul. 1955, collected by J.H. Simmonds. This specimen is the holotype of C. brisbanense (also a paratype of C. acutatum), with CBS H-20801 as an isotype, and culture ex-type CBS 292.67 = BRIP 4684.
Notes: The type and only confirmed strain of C. brisbanense was cited as one of the paratype strains of C. acutatum by Simmonds (1968) and was reassigned to C. simmondsii by Shivas & Tan (2009). Conidia and appressoria of C. brisbanense are generally larger than those of C. simmondsii as described in this treatment. The two species can be easily differentiated using all available sequence data, except for ITS, with the most effective distinctions made using TUB2 and GAPDH sequences. There is only one base pair difference in the CHS-1 sequence between C. brisbanense and C. indonesiense. Additionally, another species associated with Capsicum annuum, C. scovillei, is potentially endemic to Southeast Asia. C. brisbanense can be readily differentiated from C. scovillei based on appressorium measurements and most DNA data; see C. scovillei for further information.
A BLASTn search using the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 292.67 yielded a 100% match with GU183275, the sequence from the same strain generated by Shivas & Tan (2009). The next closest match was DQ454064 from isolate S6 of Fragaria in Thailand, showing 99% identity (four differences; Sang et al. 2011). With the GAPDH sequence, there were no matches exceeding 95% identity. The ITS sequence of strain CBS 292.67 matched 100% with GU183315, a sequence from the same isolate generated by Shivas & Tan (2009).
The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph on SNA (CBS 126518) exhibits vegetative hyphae that are 1.5–9 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores are not observed, and conidiomata are absent, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can grow up to 55 µm long. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 7–15 × 3–4.5 µm, with an opening diameter of 1.5–2 µm, a distinct collarette of 0.5–1 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and broadly ellipsoidal to ovoid, with both ends acute. Their dimensions range from (6–)7–9.5(–12) × (3–)4–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.3 ± 1.3 × 4.8 ± 0.6 µm, and a length-to-width ratio of 1.7. Conidia from aerial mycelium are shorter, measuring (3.5–)4.5–9(–15) × 3–5(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 6.7 ± 2.3 × 4.1 ± 0.8 µm, and a length-to-width ratio of 1.6. Appressoria are single, medium brown, smooth-walled, and vary in shape from subglobose to elliptical or irregular, with entire, undulate, or lobate margins, measuring (5–)5.5–9.5(–11.3) × (3–)4.5–6.5(–7.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.5 ± 1.8 × 5.4 ± 1.1 µm, and a length-to-width ratio of 1.4.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stems (CBS 126518) features acervular conidiomata, with conidiophores formed on a cushion of angular cells measuring 3–8.5 µm in diameter. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 40 µm long. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 7–16.5 × 3.5–4.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, a distinct collarette of 0.5–1 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and range from subglobose to broadly ellipsoidal or oval, with both ends approximately acute, measuring (3.5–)6.5–10.5(–13.5) × (3.5–)4–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.5 ± 1.8 × 4.5 ± 0.5 µm, and a length-to-width ratio of 1.9.
Netherlands: Emmeloord, from a twisted stem of Carthamus sp., unknown collection date and collector, culture CBS 126518 = PD 84/520; from vascular discoloration of Glebionis carinata, collection date and collector unknown, culture CBS 126519.
China: Hong Kong, from a leaf spot of Glebionis coronaria, deposited in IMI 1994 by Wan-chi Ko as culture no. 1964, culture IMI 365540.
Gloeosporium chrysanthemi was described by Hori as causing severe anthracnose disease in Chrysanthemum coronarium (= Glebionis coronaria) in the Fukuoka prefecture of Japan (Takimoto 1924) and was transferred to Colletotrichum by Sawada (1943). A pathogen of another Asteraceae plant, Carthamus tinctorius, was described in Japan by Fukui as Marssonia carthami (Fukui 1916; see also Tanaka 1917). The fungus was later transferred to Gloeosporium by Hori & Hemmi.
Uematsu et al. (2012) re-examined authentic specimens of C. chrysanthemi collected by Takimoto in 1919 and of G. carthami collected by Hemmi in 1915, sequencing the ITS1 and TUB2 regions of these specimens as well as isolates from Carthamus, Chrysanthemum, and Calendula species from Japan. The resulting sequences placed the two species in the C. acutatum species complex. While all specimens and strains had almost identical ITS sequences, two groups emerged in the TUB2 phylogeny, placing most of the Calendula isolates with the authentic specimen of G. carthami and the Chrysanthemum and Carthamus isolates, along with two Calendula isolates, with the authentic specimen of G. chrysanthemi. This suggests that the two species are separate. Despite this, the authors regard C. chrysanthemi as a synonym of the older species G. carthami. Based on TUB2 sequences of the authentic specimens (AB696992, AB696993) and some strains from Calendula (AB688785, AB688787), Carthamus (AB688807, AB688811), and Chrysanthemum (AB688791) included in our alignment (not shown), the isolates studied here group with the Japanese isolates from Carthamus and Chrysanthemum as well as the authentic specimen of G. chrysanthemi. Thus, we treat them here as C. chrysanthemi. The TUB2 sequences of the Calendula isolates and the authentic material of G. carthami appear to belong to a different clade not included in our study.
There are few additional reports of Colletotrichum on Carthamus, Chrysanthemum, and Calendula. Sette et al. (1999) report C. acutatum on Carthamus tinctorius in Korea; the fungus formed strongly fusiform conidia (see fig. 2 in Sette et al. 1999) and produced setae at least occasionally on the host plant and PDA medium. Vichova et al. (2011) found C. simmondsii on Carthamus tinctorius in the Czech Republic. Another species, C. dahliae, was also described on Chrysanthemum and Dahlia in Portugal; this species, however, forms larger conidia with round ends, measuring 16–19 × 5.3–7 µm (Costa & Sousa da Câmara 1953).

Fig. 7. Colletotrichum cosmi (from ex-holotype strain CBS 853.73). Panels A–B show conidiomata; C–H display conidiophores; I–N illustrate appressoria; O–P depict conidia. A, C–E, O are from Anthriscus stem; B, F–N, P are from SNA. A–B are viewed using DM, while C–P are under DIC. Scale bars are as follows: A = 200 µm, B = 100 µm, and C = 10 µm. The scale bar for C applies to panels C–P.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, hyaline, buff to pale honey. On filter paper, they are partly pale olivaceous grey, and the medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stem are partially covered with floccose-felty whitish to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and orange acervuli. The reverse of the filter paper is partly pale cinnamon and pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey. The growth rate is 23–24 mm in 7 days (33.5–34 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with entire margins, entirely covered with thin floccose-felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and orange acervuli. The reverse is vinaceous buff, purplish grey to fuscous black, with a growth rate of 23–25 mm in 7 days (33.5–37.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are orange.
Material examined: Netherlands, Wageningen, from seed of Cosmos sp., collection date and collector unknown (deposited in CBS collection in Nov. 1973 by G.H. Boerema), (CBS H-20794 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 853.73 = PD 73/856).
Notes: Kwon et al. (1999) report that C. acutatum (s. lat.) causes sunken brownish spots on stems, as well as symptoms on leaves, flowers, and floral axes of Cosmos bipinnatus in Korea. Morphological characters (conidia, appressoria) are similar to those of strain CBS 853.73, except for setae, which our strain did not develop under standard culture conditions. It is therefore possible that the collection from Korea represents C. cosmi. Colletotrichum acutatum (s. lat.) is also known as an anthracnose pathogen of flowers and flower buds of Cosmos bipinnatus in Japan (Yaguchi et al. 1996). The shape of conidia and appressoria of the Japanese fungus are similar to our strain, but the conidia are smaller, measuring 11–14 × 2.8–3.5 µm.
Colletotrichum cosmi is part of clade 2. It can be distinguished from other species by all gene sequences, with only 1 base pair (bp) divergence observed in most cases. Greater sequence divergences are noted in the GAPDH and HIS3 genes; however, when analyzed individually, the species is found within the highly variable C. nymphaeae clade. The closest match in a blastn search using the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 853.73 (with 99% identity and 4 bp differences) was GU246633 from isolate R14 from Capsicum annuum in South Korea (Sang et al. 2011). The closest match for the GAPDH sequence, covering nearly the full length, showed 98% identity with 4 bp differences, corresponding to HQ846724 from isolate OBP6 from an unknown plant, likely from India (P. Chowdappa, C.S. Chethana, S. Madhura, unpublished data). We do not consider these data sufficient, in isolation, to identify these sequences as originating from C. cosmi. There are 22 sequences in GenBank that match the ITS sequence of strain CBS 853.73 with 99% identity, all exhibiting 2 bp differences.

Colletotrichum costaricense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800499.
Etymology: Named after Costa Rica, the country of collection.
The sexual morph was not observed. The asexual morph was found on SNA, characterized by vegetative hyphae measuring 1–9.5 µm in diameter, which are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed, and conidiomata were not developed, with conidiophores forming directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, and can be simple, septate, or branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, and vary from cylindrical to ampulliform, with polyphialides noted. Their dimensions are 4.5–24 × 2–3.5 µm, with openings measuring 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes ranging from 0.5–1.5 µm long, exhibiting visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (9–)11.5–18(–28) × (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 3.1 × 3.7 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in a length/width ratio of 4.0. Appressoria are sparse, occurring singly or in small groups, pale brown, smooth-walled, subglobose to elliptical, with entire to undulate edges, measuring (4.5–)6–8.5(–10) × (3–)4–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.1 ± 1.2 × 4.9 ± 0.9 µm, and a length/width ratio of 1.4. The appressoria of strain CBS 211.78 are medium brown.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stems shows no developed conidiomata, with conidiophores and setae arising directly from hyphae. Setae are medium to dark brown, smooth-walled to finely verruculose, 0–2-septate, and measure 50–60 µm in length, with a cylindrical base of 3.5–4.5 µm in diameter, tapering to an acute tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 40 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, and range from cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 8–22 × 3–5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, collarettes of 1–1.5 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with acute ends, measuring (12.5–)13.5–16(–18) × 3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.8 ± 1.4 × 3.8 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in a length/width ratio of 3.9.
Material Examined: Costa Rica, Meseta Central, from the berry of Coffea arabica cv. Typica; collection date and collector unknown (deposited in CBS collection June 1975 by D. Mulder, Wageningen), (CBS H-20811 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 330.75). Turrialba, from twig of Coffea sp.; collection date and collector unknown (deposited in CBS collection April 1978 by C. Bianchini), culture CBS 211.78 = IMI 309622.
Notes: Von Arx (in litt.) identified the strain CBS 330.75 as C. acutatum, but remarked that it deviates by lack of pigment and has less fusiform conidia. While the main causal agent of coffee berry disease (CBD) is C. kahawae (Waller et al. 1993), which belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012), strains from the C. acutatum aggregate are not frequently associated with coffee. Hindorf (1973) studied Colletotrichum populations from Coffea arabica in Kenya and illustrated that conidia or ascospores of some strains diverge in morphology and culture appearance, including a strain identified as C. acutatum and another as C. gloeosporioides, with some conidia being ellipsoidal and acute-ended. One of the two strains from western Kenya assigned to C. acutatum s. str. was derived from a suspected disease symptom on a coffee berry that did not cause CBD (Gielink & Vermeulen, 1983). An endophytic strain from Coffea robusta in Brazil studied by Sette et al. (2006) showed antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus and belongs to the C. acutatum species complex; however, only a short ITS sequence was generated for this strain (DQ123614), preventing identification. Colletotrichum walleri (clade 2) is known from a single strain from coffee in Vietnam. Colletotrichum costaricense is distinct from either of these taxa based on molecular sequence data.
Two Colletotrichum species have previously been described from the leaves of Coffea sp. in Costa Rica: C. brachysporum and C. coffeophilum. The conidia of C. brachysporum are smaller than those of C. costaricense and have a different shape; they are subglobose-ovoid and measure 7–8 × 4–6 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931), whereas those of C. costaricense measure on average 14.6 × 3.7 µm or 14.8 × 3.8 µm depending on the medium. Conidia of C. coffeophilum are wider than those of C. costaricense, being ellipsoidal and straight or slightly curved (navicular), measuring 13–15 × 6–8 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931).
Colletotrichum costaricense can be differentiated from other species accepted here by TUB2, GAPDH, and ACT sequences, most effectively with TUB2. The ACT sequences of the two strains differ by 2 bp, but share only 1 bp in common that separates them from C. lupini and some unnamed single strains. The closest match in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 330.75 showed 99% identity (3 bp differences) with FN611028 from a Citrus sinensis isolate (Ramos et al. 2006), while the closest matches with the GAPDH sequence showed 99% identity (2 differences) with EU647322 and EU647324 from leatherleaf fern isolates (MacKenzie et al. 2009), all of which were from Florida, USA. The closest matches with the ITS sequence showed 100% identity with FN566877 from isolate DPI from Citrus aurantifolia in Florida, USA (Ramos et al. 2006) and isolate c2 from Citrus sp. in Brazil (Giaretta et al. 2010).
Colletotrichum cuscutae Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800500. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Cuscuta.
Occasionally observed, discrete phialides measure 4–14.5 × 2.5–4.5 µm, opening with a diameter of 1.5–2 µm. The collarette is 0.5–1.5 µm long, with conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (15.5–) 17.5–21(–27) × (3–) 3.5–4.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 19.2 ± 1.7 × 4.0 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in an L/W ratio of 4.8. Appressoria may occur singly or in loose clusters; they are pale brown, smooth-walled, elliptical to clavate, with an entire edge measuring (3.5–) 5.5–11.5(–15.5) × (2–) 3.5–5.5(–6.5) µm, yielding a mean ± SD of 8.5 ± 3.2 × 4.6 ± 0.9 µm, with an L/W ratio of 1.8.
The asexual morph is observed on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores formed on pale brown angular basal cells measuring 3–8 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 40 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to fusiform, with both ends acute, measuring 8–21 × 2–3.5 µm. They open at a diameter of 1–2 µm, have a collarette of 0.5–1 µm long, and exhibit conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with acute ends, measuring (15–) 17–20(–21) × (3.5–) 4–4.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 18.6 ± 1.5 × 4.2 ± 0.2 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.5.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to buff. On filter paper and Anthriscus stems, they are partly covered with woolly to felty white to pale grey aerial mycelium and orange acervuli. The reverse is hyaline to buff, and under filter paper, it appears pale olivaceous grey, with growth measuring 20 mm in 7 days (30 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat to raised with an entire margin, partly covered with woolly white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and olivaceous grey to orange acervuli appearing in rings. The reverse is buff, pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey with orange sectors, showing growth of 19–21 mm in 7 days (27.5–31 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are orange.
Material Examined: Dominica, Castle Comfort, from Cuscuta sp., 1986, C. Prior (IMI 304802 holotype, CBS H-20784 isotype, culture ex-type IMI 304802).
Notes: Colletotrichum cuscutae is known from a single strain reported from Dominica. Multigene analysis indicates that it occupies a distinct subclade within clade 1, separate from the principal subclade of C. lupini. Its conidia are substantially longer than those typical for C. lupini (mean length 18.6 µm compared to 12 µm for C. lupini), although the length range for C. lupini is considerable. The appressoria of C. cuscutae are narrower and exhibit a greater length/width ratio compared to those of C. lupini.
Previous reports have indicated that Colletotrichum species parasitize Cuscuta species, which are non-photosynthetic parasites of other plants. Colletotrichum destructivum was found to affect Cuscuta campestris parasitizing alfalfa crops in NW USA (Leach 1958). A strain identified as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. cuscutae was used widely as a biological control agent, “Lu Bao no. 1,” for Cuscuta in China after its adoption in the 1960s (Zhang 1985, Gao & Gan 1992), though its current commercial status is unknown, and it may no longer be in production (Watson et al. 2000). Watson et al. (2000) and Dinoor et al. (2009) suggest that the Lu Bao strain belongs to C. acutatum rather than C. gloeosporioides. However, no detailed morphological data are available, and the identification as C. acutatum was based on primers that were previously considered species-specific for two species now recognized as complexes.
Guerber et al. (2003) studied isolates from Cuscuta in the USA and China belonging to two different species, neither of which is conspecific with C. cuscutae. This study is based on GAPDH sequences.
(Guerber et al. 2003) identified isolates FRC2 and FRC7 from dodder in the USA as C. fioriniae, while strain 783 from China (identical to strain Lu Bao no. 1) belongs to a subclade of clade 2 not included in this study. Strain 783 has a haplotype of MspI mtDNA identical to two Australian strains causing terminal crook disease of pine, distinct from other Cuscuta strains.
To compare endophytes of a Cuscuta parasite and its hosts in India, Suryanarayanan et al. (2000) isolated 44 fungal endophytes from Cuscuta reflexa, including C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and an uncharacterized “Colletotrichum sp.” None of these strains are included in this study, and there are no corresponding sequences on GenBank.
Colletotrichum cuscutae is differentiated from other species by all studied genes except for ITS, most effectively by TUB2 and ACT. In BLASTN searches using the ITS, TUB2, and GAPDH sequences of the ex-type strain IMI 304802, no sequence matched with 100% homology. The closest matches for the TUB2 sequence (98% identity, 8 bp differences) were FN611029 and FN611028 from Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus sinensis in Florida, USA (Ramos et al. 2006), while the closest matches for the GAPDH sequence (98% identity, 4 bp differences) were EU168905, EU647318, and EU647319 from sweet orange (Peres et al. 2008, MacKenzie et al. 2009). A BLASTN search with the ITS sequence revealed many strains 99% identical to that of strain IMI 304802, including several ITS sequences from Key lime isolates, such as EU647307 and EU647308 (MacKenzie et al. 2009).

Conidia of strain CBS 129947 are smaller, measuring (10.5–)12–15(–17) × 3.5–5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.5 ± 1.7 × 4.1 ± 0.8 µm, maintaining the L/W ratio of 3.3 µm. Appressoria are solitary or in loose groups, pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, with an ellipsoidal to irregular outline, and have entire or undulate edges, measuring (4.5–)7–11.5(–15.5) × (4–)4.5–7(–10.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.2 ± 2.2 × 5.6 ± 1.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.6.

Specimens A, C–G, and S are from Anthriscus stems, while B, H–R, and T are from SNA. Imaging methods include DM for A–B and DIC for C–T, with scale bars of 200 µm for A, 100 µm for B, and 10 µm for C, with the scale bar of C applying to C–T.
Colonies on SNA filter paper exhibit orange acervuli covering the Anthriscus stem, with white to pale olivaceous-grey aerial mycelium and patches of salmon to orange acervuli. The reverse side of the filter paper shows pale olivaceous-grey to olivaceous-grey patches and spots. The growth rate is measured at 22.5–23 mm in 7 days (32.5–34 mm in 10 days). On OA, the colonies are flat with entire margins; the surface is saffron with olivaceous spots (mottled) and covered with salmon acervuli, lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse side appears salmon to pale vinaceous and olivaceous to purplish-grey, with a growth rate of 22–22.5 mm in 7 days (34–35 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear in mass as salmon to orange.

Colletotrichum fioriniae is the sole representative of clade 3, supported by all six genes analyzed (including ITS). This clade has been recognized as distinct within the C. acutatum species complex for several years (Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas 2005) and was accepted as a separate species by Shivas & Tan (2009).
In the current study, over 50 strains belonging to this species were identified, isolated from various host plants primarily in temperate zones. Evidence of heterogeneity within the species is noted, as two subclades are apparent in the phylogenetic analysis; however, neither bootstrap support nor Bayesian probability values are high enough to warrant their recognition at the species level. Additionally, strains from major hosts and countries are distributed throughout the clade.
The name C. fioriniae originates from C. acutatum var. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008), which is derived from strains isolated during an epizootic infection of the exotic scale insect Fiorinia externa in the New England region. The implication of Colletotrichum species as entomopathogens may seem surprising; however, the insects involved are sap-suckers. C. fioriniae has been found widely as an endophyte (Marcelino et al. 2009) in both the host plant of the scale insect (Tsuga canadensis) and a diverse range of associated plants. This represents a case of mutualism between Colletotrichum and its host plants, with endophytic strains serving as natural protectants against insect herbivory. A similar occurrence was reported for a strain labeled C. gloeosporioides f. sp. ortheziidae (likely belonging to C. nymphaeae) parasitizing the economically significant citrus scale insect Orthezia praelonga in Brazil (Cesnik et al. 1996). Endophytic Colletotrichum strains have been shown to protect Theobroma cacao plants against Phytophthora pathogens (Arnold et al. 2003; Mejía et al. 2008; Rojas et al. 2010).
In fruit-rot assays conducted by Freeman and Shabi (1996), isolates from apple and peach (likely identifiable as C. fioriniae based on ITS sequence) produced lesions on various fruits, suggesting that isolates from this group have the ability to cross-infect fruit from multiple hosts. All fruits tested in the study, including almond, apple, avocado, mango, and nectarine, are host plants of C. fioriniae (Guerber et al. 2003). In pathogenicity tests, MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that isolates from blueberry (identified as C. fioriniae) did not cause lesions on strawberry leaves but did induce anthracnose on strawberry fruits, although the lesions were smaller than those caused by isolates from strawberry (identified as C. nymphaeae). They concluded that the probability of an epidemic on strawberries in Florida caused by blueberry isolates is relatively low. However, they noted that climate could influence this, as ripe rot of blueberry fruits in Florida is primarily caused by C. gloeosporioides (sensu lato), whereas in temperate regions further north, it is more commonly caused by C. acutatum (sensu lato) (Smith et al. 1996). According to our study, both species are present on strawberries, but C. fioriniae appears to be of minor importance compared to C. nymphaeae.
Marcelino et al. (2008) discovered that strains of C. fioriniae could be crossed to form a sexual morph, and some appeared to be self-fertile, although it remains unclear whether the self-fertile strains were derived from single spores. In the present study, we did not observe sexual reproduction in the strains examined.
An earlier name for C. fioriniae may be Gnomoniopsis rubicola (Stoneman 1898), which is part of a group of five species (including G. cingulata) upon which the genus Glomerella was established (Schrenk & Spaulding 1903a, b). This species was described from diseased leaves of Rubus strigosus in West Virginia. No cultures are available, and the description of the asexual morph is not detailed. However, Marcelino et al. (2009) demonstrated that C. fioriniae is widespread in the region, and both taxa produce a sexual morph. Kadow (1935) attributed a raspberry disease from the same region to G. rubicola, and a culture derived from his work (CBS 200.35) has been examined in the current study and confirmed to belong to C. fioriniae. Without sequence-based evidence from type material, we are hesitant to adopt this earlier name. To the best of our knowledge, a formal combination into Colletotrichum has never been made. The name C. rubicola was noted on herbarium labels by Ellis.

Notes: Colletotrichum godetiae was described from seeds of Clarkia (syn. Godetia) hybrida cv. Kelvedon Glory by Neergard (1943) and validated with a Latin description seven years later (Neergard 1950). Colletotrichum godetiae corresponds to the C. acutatum group A4 as recognized by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) and to part of clade F as defined by Guerber et al. (2003). According to Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005), group A4 corresponds to group B from New Zealand (Lardner et al. 1999). However, the only C. acutatum group B strain from New Zealand that we have studied belongs to C. acerbum (A6-2). Faedda et al. (2011) described strains from group A4 that cause olive anthracnose in Italy as C. clavatum, not knowing that an older name for this species exists, of which the ex-holotype culture is available in the CBS culture collection. The ex-holo- and ex-paratype strains are included in this study (Fig. 1). Von Arx (1957) regarded C. godetiae as a synonym of Colletotrichum guajavae Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800501. Fig. 12.
Colletotrichum godetiae also occurs on hosts such as Fragaria, Malus, and Prunus, mainly in Europe and the Near East, causing fruit, leaf, or stem (cane, twig) diseases. Most of the isolates of C. acutatum s. lat. from Rhododendron in Sweden and Latvia (Vinnere et al. 2002) belong to this species, based on ITS data. One of their strains (S1) is included in Guerber et al. (2003); its GAPDH sequence groups with C. godetiae, thus confirming this placement. Additionally, several strains from Latin America have been studied. These occupy a subclade that has comparatively high bootstrap support, but as the subclades cannot be separated using any single gene of the set we have used, we amalgamate them into one species.
Etymology: Named after the host plant, Psidium guajava.
Morphology: Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–6 µm in diameter, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata not developed; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, some polyphialides observed, measuring 7–19 × 3–4 µm, opening 1–1.5 µm in diameter, with a collarette 0.5–1 µm long and periclinal thickening visible. Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled.
One of the isolates we studied, CBS 796.72, was deposited in the CBS collection in August 1972 by G.E. Templeton. This isolate belongs to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes, which is characterized by its hyaline, smooth-walled conidia that are cylindrical, measuring 7–18 × 2–3.5 µm. The conidia appear 1–1.5 µm in diameter, with a collarette of 0.5–1.5 µm long and periclinal thickening that is conspicuous. They are aseptate and straight, with a mean length of 14.6 ± 1.7 µm and a width of 3.8 ± 0.3 µm, giving a length/width ratio of approximately 3.9.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes caused an epidemic of anthracnose disease in northern jointvetch (Aeschynomene virginica) in 1969 in Arkansas, USA, and in the following years, it was successfully applied as a biological control agent against this weed. According to our multigene phylogeny, this isolate belongs to the C. godetiae clade. Daniel et al. (1973) noted that C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes is specific to Aeschynomene species and is considered more virulent to A. virginica than to A. indica, with no impact on rice, soybeans, cotton, or twelve other common crops tested.
The fungus developed as the weed biocontrol agent Collego (TeBeest 1988, Ditmore et al. 2008) against A. virginica and is genetically distinct from C. godetiae. It belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex and is newly described in this volume as C. aeschynomenes (Weir et al. 2012, this issue). This distinction may explain the differences in host range noted by TeBeest (1988). There is also some confusion regarding the host plant. Aeschynomene virginica, found in soybean and rice fields, is often misidentified as A. indica, while the true A. virginica is rare, threatened, and was federally listed as a threatened species in the United States in 1992 (www.wikipedia.org).
Material examined includes a specimen from India, Assam, Silchar, collected from the fruit of Psidium guajava, with the collection date and collector unknown (deposited in IMI 1991 by M. Das as isolate India No. 1). The holotype is IMI 350839, with CBS H-20793 as an isotype, and culture ex-type is IMI 350839.
Notes: Anthracnose and fruit canker of guava are serious diseases in the Indian subcontinent, caused in part by C. psidii. However, the identity of the guava pathogen requires further clarification.
Figure 12. Colletotrichum guajavae (from ex-holotype strain IMI 350839). A–B: Conidiomata. C: Seta. D–H: Conidiophores. I–N: Appressoria. O–P: Conidia. A, C–E, O: from Anthriscus stem. B, F–N, P: from SNA. A–B: DM; C–P: DIC. Scale bars: A = 100 µm; D = 10 µm. The scale bar for A applies to A–B, and the scale bar for D applies to C–P.
The conidiomata observed were similar to those found in Glomerella. The Gloeosporium stage linked to C. acutatum may include Gm. psidii, described from Psidium pomiferi (syn. Psidium guajava) in Mexico, which produces ellipsoidal-ovoid conidia measuring 10–16 × 4–6 µm (Saccardo 1906). The conidia of Gm. psidii are broader than those of C. guajavae. Additionally, Gloeosporium fructus-psidii was identified on fruits of Psidium in São Paulo, Brazil, described as forming oblong, subfusoid to clavate, hyaline conidia measuring 14–20 × 5–6 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931). The shape of the conidia from this species also indicates a relation to the C. acutatum complex; however, no species within this complex typically exhibits conidia wider than 5 µm. In contrast, the conidia of C. guajavae are notably smaller, measuring an average of 13.4 × 3.5 µm on SNA and 14.6 × 3.8 µm on the Anthriscus stem.
Peres et al. (2002) isolated C. acutatum (sensu lato) from a guava fruit in Brazil, which caused lesions slightly larger than those caused by a C. acutatum (sensu lato) isolate from strawberry. The ITS sequences generated indicated that the isolates from guava and strawberry in Brazil belong to the same major clade as C. guajavae. The ITS sequence is identical to that of C. guajavae, yet it matches several other species within this complex, making precise identification impossible without further information. A phylogenetic analysis from combined GAPDH and GS sequences in the study by Guerber et al. (2003) places both strains within clade D (equivalent to clade 2 in this study), but not within the same subclade. The GAPDH sequence from Guerber et al. (2003) differs by 5 base pairs from that of C. guajavae ex-holotype strain IMI 350839. Additionally, a strain from guava in New Zealand, included in the same study, belongs to clade J3 sensu Guerber et al. (2003) (identified as C. acutatum sensu stricto). Beyond C. acutatum sensu lato and C. psidii, Farr & Rossman (2012) list occurrences of C. coccodes in Myanmar, C. gloeosporioides in Brazil, China, Cuba, India, Mexico, Puerto Rico, South Africa, the USA, the Virgin Islands, and Mexico, as well as Colletotrichum sp. in Brazil, Jamaica, and Mexico; it is possible that some of these reports may actually refer to C. guajavae.
Colletotrichum guajavae can be distinguished from other species in clade 2 of the C. acutatum complex using TUB2, GAPDH, and ACT sequences, with GAPDH proving most effective. Data from GAPDH alone place the species within the highly variable C. nymphaeae cluster. With TUB2 and ACT, there is only a 1 base pair difference between C. guajavae and C. scovillei, while CHS-1 and HIS3 sequences are identical to those of C. scovillei. Morphologically, C. guajavae is not reliably distinguishable from these species. BLASTn searches with the GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 853.73 show 100% identity with HM038337 from a Colletotrichum sp. isolate MFU 09 0624 from Ziziphus mauritiana (jujube) in Laos (Phoulivong et al. 2010), suggesting that this strain may also belong to C. guajavae. The closest match for the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 853.73, showing 100% identity, was GU246633 from isolate R14 from Capsicum annuum in South Korea (Sang et al. 2011). This isolate is identified as C. scovillei; however, the available sequence does not encompass the region containing the single nucleotide polymorphism that differentiates the TUB2 sequences of C. guajavae and C. scovillei.
Colletotrichum indonesiense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800502. Fig. 13.
Etymology: Named after the country of origin, Indonesia.
The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph is found on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–7 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores have not been observed. Conidiomata are not developed; conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae have not been observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, simple or septate, and branched, reaching lengths of up to 40 µm. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slightly inflated, measuring 8–21 × 2–3.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter. The collarette is 1–1.5 µm long, and periclinal thickening is distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, with one end rounded and the other acute, measuring (8–)10–14.5(–18) × (2.5–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.3 ± 2.4 × 3.8 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.2. Appressoria are single, pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, elliptical to subglobose in outline, with entire edges that are sometimes undulate, measuring 5.5–9(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–7.5(–9) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.5 ± 1.8 × 6.3 ± 1.0 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.2.
The asexual morph occurs on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores formed on pale brown, angular basal cells measuring 2.5–6 µm in diameter. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can grow up to 60 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and sometimes slightly inflated, measuring 9–25 × 2–4 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter. The collarette is 1–1.5 µm long, and periclinal thickening is visible. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical to fusiform, with both ends acute, measuring (10.5–)13–17.5(–19) × (3–)3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.4 ± 2.2 × 3.7 ± 0.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.1.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat, partly raised with entire margins, hyaline, buff to pale honey in color. The medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stems are partly covered with irregular white aerial mycelium, and the Anthriscus stem is partly covered with orange acervuli. The reverse is hyaline, white, buff to cinnamon, while the filter paper shows olivaceous grey; the growth rate is 18.5–20 mm in 7 days (30–31 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat, partly raised with entire margins, and have surfaces covered with irregular floccose to woolly white to olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and a few orange acervuli. The reverse is buff, cinnamon to dark purplish grey; the growth rate is 22.5–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–34 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear orange in mass.
Material examined: Indonesia: Sumatra, Tele, from leaf spots developing after herbicide treatment of Eucalyptus sp., 1 Jan. 2008, M.J. Wingfield (CBS H-20798 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 127551 = CPC 14986).
Notes: Eucalyptus is not a well-known disease reservoir for Colletotrichum species. Colletotrichum eucalypti was described from Brazil by Bitancourt (1927) and noted again by Viégas (1946) from the Campinas region, causing anthracnose of Eucalyptus leaves. Viégas described the species as having conidia that are elongate-fusiform to oblong and 10–20 × 3–5 µm in size; this description is reminiscent of the C. acutatum species complex, but cultures are not available, and we have not seen type material, as the species was described from a different continent.
Several Gloeosporium species have been described on Eucalyptus spp. in different countries, but none have been described in Asia, and most differ considerably from C. indonesiense. Gloeosporium eucalypti was described on E. corynocalyx in...
There are several species of Colletotrichum in the C. boninense species complex known to affect Eucalyptus. Both C. boninense and C. karstii have been found on Eucalyptus in South Africa, and C. karstii also occurs on the related host genus Eugenia in Brazil (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).
Colletotrichum indonesiense is differentiated from other species by TUB2, ACT, GAPDH, and CHS-1 sequences, with the TUB2 sequence being the most effective for distinction. The CHS-1 sequence shows only one base pair (bp) difference from C. laticiphilum, while the HIS3 sequence is identical to that of C. laticiphilum. The closest match in a BLAST search using the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 127551 showed 99% identity (with six differences) to GU246633 from isolate R14 of Capsicum annuum from South Korea (identified by us as C. scovillei). The closest match with the GAPDH sequence (97% identity, seven bp differences) is isolate OCC95 from an unspecified crop in India (HQ846719; P. Chowdappa, C.S. Chethana, S. Madhura, unpublished data). Over 40 ITS sequences in GenBank show 99% identity (one bp difference) to the ITS sequence of C. indonesiense.
Colletotrichum johnstonii Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800503.
Etymology: Named in honor of Peter R. Johnston (Landcare Research), a major contributor to recent advancements in Colletotrichum systematics.
The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph is found on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–7 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores have not been observed. Conidiomata are not developed, and conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae are not observed in the type specimen but are present in strain IMI 357027. These are medium brown, with the basal cell sometimes pale brown, smooth-walled, 0–1-septate, and 35–55 µm long, with a base that is cylindric-conical and often constricted at the septum, measuring 3.5–4 µm in diameter, and with a tip that is ± acute. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, sometimes slightly inflated, and occasionally lack a basal septum, merging with the conidiophore. Some polyphialides are observed; discrete phialides measure 6–27 × 2.5–4 µm, with an opening diameter of 1–2 µm and a distinct collarette of 1–1.5 µm in length. Periclinal thickening is apparent. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform, with one end slightly acute and the other end round or slightly acute, measuring (13.5–)14.5–19(–21.5) × (3.5–)4.5–5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.7 ± 2.1 × 4.7 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.6. Appressoria are sparse, occurring singly or in loose groups, pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, elliptical to clavate or irregular in shape, with undulate or entire outlines, measuring (6–)8–11.5(–14) × (2–)4–7.5(–10.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.6 ± 1.7 × 5.8 ± 1.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.7.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stems shows acervular conidiomata. Conidiophores form on pale brown, angular basal cells measuring 3.5–7.5 µm in diameter. Setae are not observed in the type but are present in strain IMI 357027; these are medium brown, with a pale brown basal cell, smooth-walled, 0–1-septate, and 40–60 µm long, with a base that is cylindric-conical to slightly inflated, 2.5–5 µm in diameter, and a tip that is ± acute to ± roundish, sometimes constricted. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 60 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 11–26 × 2.5–4 µm, with an opening diameter of 1–2 µm and a collarette length of 1 µm, showing distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical to fusiform, with dimensions of (14.5–)15.5–17(–18) × 4.5–5(–5.5) µm, a mean ± SD of 16.3 ± 1.0 × 4.9 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.3.
Material Examined: New Zealand, AK, Auckland, from fruit rot of Solanum lycopersicum, 29 Feb. 1990, J.M. Dingley (CBS H-20809 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128532 = ICMP 12926 = PRJ 1139.3); Takaka, from fruit rot of Citrus sp., 1989, collector unknown (deposited in IMI 1993 by P.R. Johnston, No. 1125.5), culture IMI 357027 = PRJ 1125.5.
Notes: Colletotrichum johnstonii is part of clade 4 but has slightly longer conidia than those of C. godetiae, and can be differentiated from other species based on ACT, HIS3, TUB2, and GAPDH sequences. The ACT gene is the most effective for differentiation. The GAPDH sequence differs by only 1 bp from that of C. godetiae, while the CHS-1 sequences of both species are identical. Two C. johnstonii strains from citrus and tomato, along with a newly described strain from pear (C. pyricola), were included in the C. acutatum group C by Lardner et al. (1999). Two tamarillo strains from Lardner’s group C showed nearly identical RAPD banding patterns to the ex-type strain of C. johnstonii. The study by Guerber et al. (2003) includes two strains from citrus (PJ50 = PRJ 1125.5 and PJ49 = PRJ 1124.5) and one from tamarillo (Pj18 = PRJ 979.9) from New Zealand, all assigned to group C in Lardner et al. (1999). Current evidence suggests that C. johnstonii is endemic to New Zealand but is not host-specific.
The closest matches in GenBank with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 128532 show 98% identity with AJ409294 from Fragaria in the UK (Talhinhas et al. 2002) and various isolates from olive (Talhinhas et al. 2005). However, we do not consider these sequences as further records of C. johnstonii. With the GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 128532, no closer match exceeded 88% identity. The ITS sequence of strain CBS 128532 is identical to those of C. salicis, C. pyricola, and C. phormii.
Colletotrichum kinghornii Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800504.
Etymology: Named after W.O. Kinghorn, who previously studied this fungus.
Morphology: Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA: vegetative hyphae hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, 1–6 µm diam. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata absent; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, up to 45 µm long. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, conical or ± inflated, measuring 5.5–18 × 2–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm diam and collarette of 0.5–1.5, showing visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with one round and one truncate end, measuring (11–)15.5–21(–22.5) × (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 18.3 ± 2.9 × 3.8 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.9. Appressoria not observed.
Asexual morph on Anthriscus stem: Conidiomata absent; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, sometimes branched, up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to clavate, measuring 20–27 × 2.5–4 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm diam, collarette of 1 µm, and visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with one round and one truncate end, measuring (n = 18) (15–)16–20.5(–23) × 3.5–4.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 18.1 ± 2.3 × 4.0 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.6.
Colletotrichum kinghornii (from ex-holotype strain CBS 198.35).
Scale bars: B = 10 µm; the scale bar of B applies to A–L.
UK, Scotland, from Phormium tenax, unknown collection date, N.L. Alcock (deposited in CBS collection Feb. 1935 by W.O. Kinghorn as Glomerella phacidiomorpha), (CBS H-20909 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 198.35).
Kinghorn (1936) worked on two strains isolated from Phormium collected in Scotland by N.L. Alcock. Both were identified as C. phormii by Farr et al. (2006). One is confirmed as C. phormii in this study, but the other (CBS 198.35) is distinct at the molecular level. Kinghorn named his material Glomerella phacidiomorpha, but Farr et al. (2006) examined the type and found it to be a species of Phaeosphaeriopsis.
Colletotrichum kinghornii is one of two species in the C. acutatum complex with the largest conidia; only those of C. phormii are larger. However, strain CBS 198.35 rarely produces spores, and the conidia measured were primarily formed in the aerial mycelium. Molecular analyses indicate that strain CBS 198.35 is a separate species from C. phormii, with several sequence differences in almost every gene, including a single base pair difference in the ITS sequence (not detected in the Farr et al. study). Colletotrichum kinghornii is most effectively distinguished from other species using the HIS3 gene.
The closest match in BLASTn searches with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 198.35 (98% identity, 7 bp differences) was Glomerella acutata isolate PCF 459 (EU635504) from strawberry in Belgium (Debode et al. 2009), and with 98% identity (8 bp differences) to isolate PT250 (= CBS 129953) AJ748624 from olive in Portugal (see A6-1) (Talhinhas et al. 2005). This last strain is classified as C. rhombiforme in this study. The GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 198.35 showed no closer match from GenBank than 86% identity.
Colletotrichum laticiphilum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800505.
Etymology: From Greek "latex" meaning milk, and "-philus" meaning loving; this refers to the economically significant feature of the host plant.
Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–7.5 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are not developed; conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, simple or septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, ampulliform to conical, sometimes lacking a basal septum and continuous with the conidiophore. Discrete phialides measure 6.5–15 × 3–4.5 µm, with openings 1–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes measuring 0.5–1.5 µm long, with periclinal thickening visible. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with both ends ± acute or one end round and the other slightly acute, measuring (9.5–) 13.5–19.5(–25.5) × (3–) 3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.6 ± 3.1 × 3.8 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.4. Conidia from CBS 129827 are smaller, measuring (5–) 8–15(–18.5) × (1.5–) 2.5–4.5(–5.3) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.5 ± 3.4 × 3.6 ± 0.9 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.2. Appressoria are single, medium brown, smooth-walled, subglobose to elliptical or clavate, with entire or rarely slightly undulate edges, measuring (5–) 6.5–12(–16) × (4–) 6–8(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.2 ± 2.8 × 7.2 ± 1.0 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3. Appressoria from CBS 129827 are smaller, measuring (4–) 5–7(–8) × (2.5–) 3.5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 6.0 ± 1.1 × 4.5 ± 0.8 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stem shows possibly acervular conidiomata, but no basal cells were observed. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, reaching lengths of up to 25 µm. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline...

Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, their surface white, buff to pale isabelline, covered with short felty white aerial mycelium, and the reverse is buff to honey; growth rate is 22.5–23 mm in 7 days (32.5–35 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear whitish.
India, Kerala, Kottayam, Rubber Research Institute campus, from raised spots on the leaf of Hevea brasiliensis, 1999, unknown collector (CBS H-20799 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 112989 = IMI 383015 = STE-U 5303 = CG). Colombia, Meta, Villavicencio, from leaf, anthracnose of Hevea brasiliensis, 14 Aug. 2010, O. Castro, culture CBS 129827 = CH2.6.
Colletotrichum leaf disease (CLD) is a significant factor in declining yields of Hevea brasiliensis in Southeast Asia (Brown & Soepena 1994; Jayasinghe et al. 1997; Saha et al. 2002). Initially, the pathogen was routinely identified as C. heveae (Petch 1906) and later assumed to be C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) (Carpenter & Stevenson 1954; von Arx 1957).
Jayasinghe and colleagues found that most strains examined from Sri Lanka belonged to C. acutatum (s. lat.), and Saha et al. (2002) reported this species from India as well, indicating that similar strains are likely widespread in the region. Saha et al. (2002) revealed that C. acutatum (s. lat.) causes raised spot symptoms, while C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) causes both anthracnose and papery lesions on Hevea leaves in India. In a study from Sri Lanka, Thambugala & Deshappriya (2009) found that C. acutatum causes larger lesions and can act synergistically with C. gloeosporioides to cause CLD. Strain IMI 383015 is one of the strains responsible for the raised spots on Hevea leaves in India. It was included in the studies by Saha et al. (2002) and Lubbe et al. (2004), which generated its ITS and TUB2 sequences. The TUB2 sequence of strain IMI 383015 (AY376556) was also part of the TUB2 phylogeny by Shivas & Tan (2009), where the strain was identified as C. simmonsii.
It is necessary to consider the potential conspecificity of C. laticiphilum with three previously described taxa, all published by Petch in 1906 from collections made from Hevea in Sri Lanka. These were named as C. heveae, Gloeosporium heveae (nomenclaturally unrelated to C. heveae), and Gm. alborubrum. All three species were regarded as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957).
The conidia of Gm. heveae are approximately the same size as those of C. laticiphilum (12–17 × 3.5–5 µm); however, the spores extrude in a pale brown mass, which is unusual for a Colletotrichum. The size range of the "basidia" (conidiogenous cells) is reported as 20–34 × 2 µm; the corresponding structures of C. laticiphilum are shorter and much wider. There is no material in K(M) identified as Gm. heveae. It is possible that the fungus identified as Gm. brunneum in the type collection of C. heveae is actually Gm. heveae, as Gm. brunneum is a completely unrelated fungus originating from Populus leaves in the USA (Ellis & Everhart, 1889). Petch may have realized after writing the packet label, but before publication, that naming his fungus Gm. brunneum would create a later homonym. Petch (1927) indicated that Gm. heveae was found only in one isolated instance in 1905, when it caused leaf fall in young nursery-grown plants, resulting in general discoloration and death of the entire leaf blade. The disease was successfully controlled by reducing exposure to shade. Synonymy of Gm. heveae with our fungus would not affect the naming of C. laticiphilum, as a combination into Colletotrichum based on Gm. heveae would be a later homonym of C. heveae.
It seems possible that Gm. alborubrum might refer to the species described here. According to Saha et al. (2002), a symptom consisting of raised spots had been attributed to this species. The fungus was originally described from green stems of Hevea brasiliensis, but Petch (1927) stated that it caused abnormal leaf fall and appeared to spread to the green ends of the branches, resulting in dieback. He suggested it might be a secondary invader following Phytophthora infection. These symptoms do not seem to correspond well with those described by Saha and colleagues. The conidia of Gm. alborubrum were measured as 15–20 × 3–4 µm and were described as oblong with rounded ends, straight or slightly curved, and issuing in thick pink or white tendrils (Petch, 1906). The size is similar to that of C. laticiphilum; we also observed slightly curved conidia, especially in the isolate from Colombia (CBS 129827). The conidial shape of both C. laticiphilum isolates on Anthriscus stem is not fusiform, but cylindrical, with one end round and the other end only slightly acute. There are three specimens in K(M) identified by Petch as belonging to Gm. alborubrum, but none can be considered type material, as they were all collected after the name was published.
Bearing in mind that definite type material for all three names is either missing or fragmentary and that none of the authentic material is likely to yield good sequences, we believe it is more practical to publish a new taxon rather than to epitypify or neotypify one of the earlier names with a specimen that we are not confident is conspecific with the type.
Colletotrichum laticiphilum is distinguished from other species by its TUB2, GAPDH, and CHS-1 sequences, most notably with TUB2. The CHS-1 sequence shows only one base pair difference from C. indonesiense, while the HIS3 sequence is identical to that species. The closest match for the GAPDH sequence (with 99% identity and 1 bp difference) was HQ846719 from an unnamed plant, probably from India (P. Chowdappa, C.S. Chethana, S. Madhura, unpubl. data). The ITS sequence of strain CBS 112989 matches 100% with AB042306 and AB042307 from isolates from Carthamus and Glebionis in Japan (J. Moriwaki, T. Tsukiboshi, T. Sato, S. Uematsu, unpubl. data), with AJ749675 from isolate PD85/694 (= CBS 126519, C. chrysanthemi), and with AB219024 from strawberry in Japan (Chung et al., 2006).
Colletotrichum limetticola (R.E. Clausen) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB455483. Fig. 17. Basionym: Gloeosporium limetticola [as Gm. limetticolum] R.E. Clausen, Phytopathology 2: 231, 1912.
Asexual Morph on SNA (CBS 114.14): The vegetative hyphae are 1–8.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed, and conidiomata are not developed; conidiophores form directly on the hyphae. Setae were also not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, either simple or septate, and branched, reaching up to 45 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, and may be integrated (not separated from fertile hyphae by a septum). Polyphialides are rarely observed, measuring 8.5–20 × 3–5.5 µm, with openings 1–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes 0.5–1 µm long. Periclinal thickening is visible and sometimes distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight or slightly curved, cylindrical to clavate, with one end rounded and the other slightly acute or truncate, or both ends slightly acute. Some conidia may be slightly constricted in the middle, measuring (9–)12–20.5(–29) × (3–)4–5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.3 ± 4.2 × 4.5 ± 0.6 µm, and a length/width (L/W) ratio of 3.6. Appressoria occur singly or in loose groups, are pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, and exhibit a subglobose to ovoid or ellipsoidal outline, with entire or undulate edges, measuring (5–)6–8.5(–11) × (4–)4.5–6(–7) µm, and a mean ± SD of 7.4 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.7 µm, with a L/W ratio of 1.4.
Asexual Morph on Anthriscus Stem (CBS 114.14): Conidiomata and conidiophores form directly on hyphae or on a cushion of pale brown angular cells, which are 3.5–6.5 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, with lengths reaching up to 80 µm. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and slightly inflated, measuring 6–13 × 2.5–4.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes of 0.5–1 µm long. Periclinal thickening is also visible. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, clavate, or fusiform, with one end round and the other end (often only slightly) acute or both ends acute, measuring (12–)13–18(–24) × (3.5–)4–4.5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.5 ± 2.3 × 4.3 ± 0.4 µm, and a L/W ratio of 3.6.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat to low convex with an entire margin, hyaline in appearance, and the filter paper underneath is partly pale salmon to straw, covered with a felty white aerial mycelium. The reverse side is hyaline to pale ochreous, with filter paper showing a straw color; colony size is 18.5–20 mm in 7 days (26–30.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is moist, white to pale luteous, and saffron towards the center due to sporulation. Aerial mycelium is lacking, with the reverse side being whitish, buff to rosy buff, measuring 18–21.5 mm in 7 days (26–29 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear salmon in mass.
Material Examined: Specimens were collected from various locations: Cuba (Herradura, inoculation experiment XV in Berkeley, Alameda Co., California, from a twig of Citrus medica var. acida), unknown collection date (inoculated on January 30, 1912, photographed on March 20, 1912 by R.E. Clausen), with Earle (UC 302386 lectotype [not seen], BPI 394978 isolectotype). In the USA, Florida, a specimen was obtained from a young twig of Citrus aurantifolia, with the collection date and collector unknown (deposited in CBS collection February 1914 by R.E. Clausen as Gloeosporium limetticola, CBS H-20910 epitype, here designated, culture ex-epitype CBS 114.14).
Notes: Gloeosporium limetticola was described by Clausen (1912) following pathogenicity trials in California on young sour lime (Citrus medica var. acida = Citrus aurantifolia, Key lime) trees inoculated with strains from sour lime in Cuba and from strains of orange, lemon, pomelo, and tangerine from Cuba, California, and Florida. The Cuban sour lime strain from Herradura consistently caused wither tip disease symptoms on tester plants of that species.
The relevant accession at UC consists of a single packet (UC 302386) containing three additional packets. One is from Clausen’s Experiment XV and is marked “lime type”; another is from lemon (Experiment XXVII) and Cuban lime material (presumably the original diseased sample) and is marked “type material.” The lemon sample is definitely from a genetic source different from that of the lime collections and was not marked as type material. The two lime samples may well be genetically identical and could be regarded collectively as the holotype; however, we believe that treating them as two syntypes is more reasonable. This conclusion was also reached by Tavares et al. (1997), who designated the collection from Experiment XV at UC as the lectotype of Gm. limetticola.
Cultures from the type material have not been preserved. However, strain CBS 114.14 from Florida was deposited in the CBS collection in February 1914 by R.E. Clausen, as Gm. limetticola. The strain was not specified as being an ex-type strain, and we suppose that it was one of the samples requested by Clausen from the wither tip of lime in Florida. It is reasonable to consider this culture as authentic material, and we therefore designate a dried subculture as the epitype for Gm. limetticola.
The wither tip disease of Citrus aurantifolia appears to be identical to Key lime anthracnose (KLA), a specific disease affecting the leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruits of Key lime (Citrus aurantifolia), which has been well studied in recent years (Brown et al. 1996, Agostini et al. 1992, Timmer & Brown 2000, Peres et al. 2008, MacKenzie et al. 2009). While Agostini et al. (1992) identified the causal organism of KLA as C. gloeosporioides, following von Arx (1957), who listed the fungus as a synonym of that taxon, Brown et al. (1996) assigned the fungus to C. acutatum based on ITS sequence data. According to Farr & Rossman (2012), Gm. limetticola has been reported from Citrus aurantifolia in Barbados, California, Cuba, Fiji, Florida, Hawaii, India, Jamaica, the Philippines, and Tanzania.
Colletotrichum strains from anthracnose on Key lime leaves in Florida (KLA-Anderson, HM-1, Ss) and MTR-KLA-A1 (Belize) included in the studies by Peres et al. (2008) and MacKenzie et al. (2009) share the same ITS and GAPDH sequences as strain CBS 114.14. Additionally, the ITS sequences of isolates DPI from Citrus aurantifolia in Florida (FN566877, Ramos et al. 2006) and c2 from Citrus sp. in Brazil (EU008878, Giaretta et al. 2010) match that of CBS 114.14 with 100% identity. Probable C. limetticola strains are also included in Guerber et al. (2003) as mtDNA RFLP haplotype J3; the GAPDH sequences of two Key lime strains (MD33, MD15) are nearly identical to that of CBS 114.14. The closest match with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 114.14, with 100% identity, is GenBank accession FN611029 from isolate DPI as well (Ramos et al. 2006). In their study on Citrus in Portugal, Ramos et al. (2006) did not find any C. acutatum s. lat.; instead, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) seems to be the major anthracnose pathogen.
C. acutatum shows few or no sequence differences in both the ITS and GAPDH genes. Although we did not include PFD isolates in our study, ITS and GAPDH sequences indicate that PFD and KLA strains are related but appear to belong to different species. Agostini et al. (1992) noted morphological and cultural differences between PFD and KLA isolates: appressoria of PFD isolates were clavate and deeply pigmented, while those of KLA isolates were round, smaller, and less pigmented. Additionally, KLA strains grew slightly more slowly than PFD isolates.
Pathogenicity tests conducted by MacKenzie et al. (2009) yielded results similar to those by Clausen (1912); only Colletotrichum isolates from key lime caused leaf necrosis on key lime, whereas isolates from PFD, strawberry (identified as C. nymphaeae in this study), blueberry (identified as C. fioriniae), and leatherleaf fern did not. Key lime isolates also caused necrosis in flowers of Orlando tangelo flower clusters, but the percentage of affected flowers was lower compared to those inoculated with PFD isolates.
Chen et al. (2005) identified the KLAP1 gene, which is necessary for causing KLA, particularly for the infection of key lime leaves, but not for flower petals.
Colletotrichum limetticola is distinguished from other species by TUB2, GAPDH, and HIS3, with TUB2 being the most effective marker, differing by only 2 base pairs from the sequence found in CBS 129823 (a Colletotrichum species from Passiflora in Colombia, belonging to an unnamed subclade within Clade 1).

The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph appears on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–6.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores have not been observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores form directly on hyphae at the surface of the medium and in the aerial mycelium. Setae have not been observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, either simple or septate and branched, and they degenerate rapidly. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 2.5–20 × 1.5–2.5 µm, often integrated (not separated from fertile hyphae by a septum), with an opening of 0.5 µm in diameter, and a collarette that is 0.5 µm long with visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and variable in shape, typically cylindrical to clavate, with one end rounded and the other acute, measuring 9–15(–26.5) × (3–)3.5–4.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.0 ± 3.2 × 4.1 ± 0.6 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.9. Conidia from strain CBS 109221 are slightly larger, measuring 11.5–15.5(–19) × (3.5–)4–4.5(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.5 ± 1.9 × 4.3 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.2. Appressoria are found singly or in small dense clusters, medium brown, round to elliptical in outline with an undulate to lobate margin, measuring (4–)6–12(–20.5) × (4.5–)6–9(–11.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.0 ± 2.8 × 7.4 ± 1.7 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.2. Appressoria from strain CBS 109221 differ in being arranged singly or in rows along hyphae, with most having an entire margin (rarely undulate to lobate).
n=14.2±1.7×4.0±0.3μm; L/W ratio = 3.6.
Colonies on SNA (Synthetic Nutrient Agar) are flat with entire margins, hyaline, and partly covered with short white to pale grey aerial mycelium when grown on filter paper and Anthriscus stems. The reverse side of the filter paper appears white to pale luteous. Growth is measured at 15–21 mm in 7 days (25–31 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA (Oat Agar) are also flat with entire margins, exhibiting a surface covered with felty to woolly white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium. The reverse is buff to smoke grey, with growth recorded at 15–19 mm in 7 days (24–27 mm in 10 days). Notably, strain CBS 466.76 grows faster, reaching 23.5–27.5 mm in 7 days (36–37.5 mm in 10 days). The conidia appear salmon in mass.
Fig. 18 illustrates Colletotrichum lupini (from the ex-neotype strain CBS 109225), including images of conidiomata (A–B), conidiophores (C–I), appressoria (J–O), and conidia (P–Q). Images A and B are from Anthriscus stems, while B, D–O, and Q are from SNA. Dissecting microscope (DM) was used for A–B, and differential interference contrast illumination (DIC) for C–Q. Scale bars: A = 100 µm (applies to A–B) and C = 10 µm (applies to C–Q).
Ukraine: from seed of Lupinus albus, unknown date, H.I. Nirenberg, culture ex-neotype of C. lupini, CBS 109225 = BBA 70884.
Germany: from Lupinus albus, unknown date, U. Feiler, culture ex-holotype of C. lupini var. setosum, CBS 109221 = BBA 70352.
Two studies on the causal agent of lupin anthracnose published in 2002 reported different results. Talhinhas et al. regarded the agent as C. acutatum, while Nirenberg et al. concluded that the causal isolates belong to a separate species, C. lupini. They based this name on Gloeosporium lupini (Bondar 1912), but the combination is invalid due to incorrect citation of the basionym according to the ICBN. We validate the combination here. Nirenberg et al. designated a dried culture derived from BBA 70884 (= CBS 109225) as the neotype of Gm. lupini, since no type material was designated by Bondar; this action is nomenclaturally correct.
Nirenberg et al. also described a variety, C. lupini var. setosum, noting few morphological and physiological differences. Strains of var. lupini produced more conidia in the aerial mycelium, grew slightly slower on PDA, and had a lower optimum growth temperature. Var. lupini isolates typically formed concentric growth rings, while var. setosum did not. Setae were rarely observed in var. lupini but regularly seen in var. setosum; however, in our study, the ex-holotype strain of C. lupini var. setosum formed a few setae.
Nirenberg and colleagues indicated that the ITS sequences of the two varieties differ by only one base. Our study, based on analysis of six genes, revealed few additional base pair differences, complicating the distinction. The name C. lupini var. setosum was also invalidly published (Art. 43.1). Given that the species name C. lupini was invalid at the time and we do not recognize the variety as a distinct taxon, we do not validate the name here.
According to Nirenberg et al., a typical feature of C. lupini is its conidial morphology, with spores having one pointed end and one rounded. We also observed this feature when the fungus grew on Anthriscus stems. However, the conidia from the ex-neotype strain observed in this study on SNA originated from simple or branched conidiophores at the agar surface and the aerial mycelium, rather than from conidiomata, as the strain no longer produces defined acervuli on this medium. Conidia from aerial mycelium are approximately cylindrical and can be variable in size, sometimes with both ends rounded (Nirenberg et al. 2002).

Colletotrichum lupini is an economically significant pathogen of lupin crops worldwide, leading to substantial interest in breeding resistant host cultivars (e.g., Adhikari et al. 2011). While C. lupini shows a clear host preference based on the strains examined, some cultures were derived from hosts other than lupins, specifically from Manihot, Camellia, and Cinnamomum. Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) also identified Urtica dioica as a host. A study by Nirenberg & Gerlach (2000) demonstrated that a strain of C. lupini var. setosum could infect Bergenia in greenhouse tests. Pathogenicity tests by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) failed to show host specificity of C. acutatum strains from lupins (now considered C. lupini), although Lardner et al. (1999) found that the strains they categorized in C. acutatum Group D (now known to belong to C. lupini) did not infect pine seedlings like C. acutatum f. sp. pineum (now regarded as C. acutatum s. str.). The strain from Camellia in the UK (IMI 351261), deposited in 1992 by R. Cook, is likely one of the avirulent C. acutatum strains reported from ornamental Camellia species by Dickens and Cook (1989).
Our phylogeny clearly supports C. lupini as a distinct species within the C. acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum lupini is differentiated from other species by all included genes except for ACT, with TUB2 providing the best differential test.
Colletotrichum melonis Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800506. Fig. 19. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Cucumis melo.
The sexual morph was not observed. The asexual morph was studied on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–6.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores formed directly from vegetative hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and degenerate rapidly. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 7–19 × 2.5–4 µm, with an opening diameter of 1–1.5 µm, and a collarette 1–1.5 µm long, with visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, some slightly curved, cylindrical with one end rounded and one end slightly acute or rounded, rarely both ends acute, measuring (7–)9–16.5(–23.5) × (3–)3.5–4.5(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.8 ± 3.6 × 3.9 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.3. Appressoria form singly, are medium brown, smooth-walled, subglobose, elliptical, or clavate, with entire edges, rarely slightly undulate, measuring (4.5–)6–11(–13.5) × (3.5–)4.5–6.5(–7.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.3 ± 2.4 × 5.5 ± 1.0 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stem features acervular conidiomata, with conidiophores arising from pale brown angular basal cells measuring 3–7 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can grow up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform.

Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, hyaline to pale honey, and partially covered with floccose-felty white aerial mycelium on filter paper and Anthriscus stems. The reverse side displays the same colors. Growth is recorded at 20.5–21.5 mm in 7 days (27.5–32 mm in 10 days). On OA, colonies are flat with entire margins, buff, honey to saffron in color, and also partially covered with floccose-felty white aerial mycelium and saffron to isabelline acervuli. The reverse is buff, honey to rosy buff, with growth measuring 22–24 mm in 7 days (34–34.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia are present in a mass of saffron color.
Material Examined: Brazil, from the peel of the fruit of Cucumis melo, collected by an unknown collector on an unspecified date (isolated by H.A. van der Aa, No. 9014, deposited in CBS collection on March 1, 1984; CBS H-20785 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 159.84).
Notes: Colletotrichum melonis belongs to clade 1 of the C. acutatum species complex but occupies a distinct subclade supported by multiple genes. The only strain identified has appressoria with a significantly larger length/width ratio compared to those of C. lupini (mean L/W = 1.5 versus 1.2), which is the most frequently encountered species in clade 1. These appressoria form singly rather than in clusters.
The pathogenicity of C. melonis is currently unknown. This report marks the first identification of a Colletotrichum species from the C. acutatum species complex associated with cucurbits. There are various reports of diseases caused by members of the C. boninense and C. gloeosporioides clades, but the principal cucurbit pathogens appear to be Glomerella magna and C. orbiculare (von Arx & van der Velden 1961, Jenkins & Winstead 1964, Du et al. 2005, Hyde et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012).
Colletotrichum melonis is differentiated from other species by GAPDH, ACT, and HIS3 sequences, with GAPDH being the most effective as a differential gene. The TUB2 sequence is identical to that of strain IMI 384185 (an unnamed strain in clade 1). Closest matches in a BLASTn search with the GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 159.84 (97% identity, 6 bp differences) were found in EU168905, EU647318, and EU647319 from sweet orange (Peres et al. 2008, MacKenzie et al. 2009). The closest published matches with the TUB2 sequence (99% identity, 4 bp differences) were FN611029 and FN611028 from Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus sinensis in Florida, USA (Ramos et al. 2006). The ITS sequence matched 100% with EU008864–EU008866 from Malus domestica in Brazil (Giaretta et al. 2010).

Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA: vegetative hyphae 1.5–5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata absent; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 60 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 10.5–20 × 2–4 µm, with openings of 1 µm in diameter, a distinct collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to cylindric-clavate, with one end rounded and the other end rounded to ± acute, measuring (10–)14–18.5(–19.5) × (3–)4–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.1 ± 2.3 × 4.9 ± 0.7 µm and a L/W ratio of 3.3.

Conidiomata are absent, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, measuring up to 60 µm in length. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, approximately cylindrical, and sometimes polyphialidic, measuring 12–30 × 2.5–3.5 µm, with openings about 0.5 µm in diameter. The collarette is distinct and 0.5 µm long, with periclinal thickening also distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and exhibit a straight, cylindrical to cylindric-clavate shape, with one end rounded and the other end rounded to approximately acute. Their dimensions are (12.5–)14–18.5(–22.5) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.3 ± 2.1 × 4.8 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.4. Strain CBS 526.77 has wider conidia measuring (9.5–)13.5–19(–21.5) × (3.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.1 ± 2.7 × 5.6 ± 0.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9. In contrast, conidia from strain CBS 173.51 are smaller, measuring (7.5–)10–14.5(–16) × (3–)3.5–4.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.3 ± 2.0 × 3.9 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.2. Notably, the conidia of most isolates studied differ in shape from the ex-epitype strain, appearing cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, as seen in CBS 173.51 and CBS 112202.
Colonies grown on SNA are flat with entire margins, appearing hyaline with low white aerial mycelium on filter paper and Anthriscus stem. On filter paper, they are partly pale olivaceous grey on both sides, with a growth rate of 16.5 mm in 7 days (20 mm in 10 days). Some strains, such as CBS 126382, exhibit faster growth rates of 25–26 mm in 7 days (35–37 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with entire margins, their surfaces displaying colors ranging from isabelline and cinnamon to honey, with white margins. They lack aerial mycelium and show a reverse coloration of greyish sepia to buff, with a growth rate of 14.5 mm in 7 days (20 mm in 10 days). Other strains grow faster, such as CBS 126382, which grows 23.5–29 mm in 7 days (37.5–40 mm in 10 days). The colony surfaces of strains CBS 516.78 and CBS 526.77 appear dark olivaceous to iron-grey, while conidia in mass exhibit a pale salmon color.
In Italy, from Parma in the botanical garden, a sample was taken from the leaf of Nymphaea alba during the summer of 1875 by G. Passerini (Rabenhorst, Fungi Europaei exsiccati edn 2: 2251; the holotype was not selected by the original author, and its location is uncertain; K(M) 176820 isotype is designated as the lectotype; K(M) 99741 is an isolectotype; CBS H-00769 is also an isolectotype). In the Netherlands, a sample was collected near Nijmegen from leaf spots of Nymphaea alba on August 7, 1978, by G. van der Velde (CBS H-20787 is the epitype, designated here, with the culture ex-epitype CBS 515.78 = van der Aa No. 6573). Other samples were isolated from Kortenhoefse Plassen from Nymphaea alba, with the collector and date unknown (isolated August 1977 by H.A. van der Aa, culture CBS 526.77); from curl disease on Anemone coronaria De Caen, with the collector and date unknown, culture CBS 126382 = PD 79/648. In Italy, from Rome, a sample was taken from the leaf of Mahonia aquifolium, with collection date and collector unknown (deposited in the CBS collection in June 1951 by R. Ciferri, culture CBS 173.51); from Fragaria x ananassa, cv. Idea, collection date and collector unknown (sent to Plantenziektenkundige Dienst Wageningen by L. Corazza, culture CBS 126372 = PD 93/1666A). In South Africa, from the Western Cape, Stellenbosch, Elsenberg Farm, a sample was taken from Protea magnifica on April 1, 2001, by K. Lubbe (culture CBS 112992 = STE-U 4452). In Spain, samples were collected from fruit lesions of Fragaria sp. in March 2002 by H.A. van der Aa (culture CBS 112202).
Van der Aa (1978) investigated possible synonyms of Colletotrichum nymphaeae, finding that Ramularia nymphaeae (syn. Ovularia nymphaeae) was conspecific with that species. Gloeosporium nymphaearum (Allescher 1895) is the type of the genus Ovulariella, which von Arx (1970) considered a nomen nudum, although it had an indirect reference to a description in the original publication. Von Arx classified it as a later synonym of Ramularia nymphaeae, and van der Aa (1978) confirmed this synonymy. To our knowledge, there are no living cultures derived from authentic material of either of these taxa. While we have no reason to doubt van der Aa’s findings, we have not examined type material, and there is no strong reason to designate epitypes.
We examined a culture from Mahonia aquifolia from Italy, sent to CBS by R. Ciferri as C. mahoniae the year after the species was described. This could have been derived from the type of C. mahoniae, but we lack sufficient information to be certain. Another species from Mahonia, Gloeosporium japonicum (Hemmi 1920), was described as having wider conidia (10–18 × 5–7 µm) with a different shape (ellipsoidal, short-cylindrical, or ovoidal, both ends rounded). Hemmi noted that conidia in culture exhibit very variable size and shape, measuring 9–20 × 3.6–6 µm. We have not located authentic material for this taxon, but even if it were conspecific with C. nymphaeae, its name would not have priority. Von Arx (1957) regarded Gm. japonicum as a synonym of C. gloeosporioides.
Another possible synonym of C. nymphaeae is C. nymphaeicola (Kelkar 1972, as C. "nymphicola"). Judging from the description and illustration, this is certainly a species of Colletotrichum, but the conidia were described as oblong, measuring 5–15 × 1.5–3 µm. This wide variation in size makes it impossible to place it in any currently defined species. The type was reportedly deposited in HCIO, but apparently no cultures were obtained. Gloeosporium nymphaeae (Hemmi & Kawase 1954) causes symptoms similar to those of C. nymphaeae, but setae were observed, which were not noted in C. nymphaeae by either ourselves or van der Aa (1978). The conidia of Gm. nymphaeae were described as rounded at both ends, measuring 9–17 × 3–6 µm. We have not been able to locate type material or living cultures of this fungus. Another species of Colletotrichum associated with water lilies, C. nupharicola, was described by Johnson et al. (1997). This species appears to have significantly longer and wider conidia than C. nymphaeae, with mean widths of individual strains ranging between 6.5 and 7.5 µm. The figures are difficult to interpret, and the overall range of conidial size in the description is surprising. It has been found to belong within the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012).
In pathogenicity tests, MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that Colletotrichum isolates from the petiole, fruit, and crown of strawberries with anthracnose from Florida, USA, were based on ITS and GAPDH sequences.
Colletotrichum nymphaeae is well-separated from other species based on the TUB2 gene, but not in its ITS. The intraspecific variability for all other genes is very high. The closest matches (100% identity) in a BLASTn search using the TUB2 sequence of the ex-epitype strain were: AB618090 from Apium in Japan (Fujinaga et al. 2011); AY376551–AY376555 from Protea (Lubbe et al. 2004); AJ409296, AJ314716, AJ314718 from Fragaria in the USA, Portugal, and Australia; AJ314722, AJ409300, AJ748636 from Lupinus and Anemone (Talhinhas et al. 2002, 2005); and DQ454063, DQ454064 from Fragaria in Thailand (Than et al. 2008a). With 99% identity, reflecting 1 bp difference, the search yielded AJ748605, AJ748607, AJ748608, AJ748611, AJ748615 from olive; AM992148, AM992147, which are probably also from olive; AJ748633 from Photinia (Talhinhas et al. 2005, 2009); and GQ369612 from a strain identified as C. caudatum (Chen H, Feng Y, and Hyde KD, unpublished data). With 99% identity, reflecting 2 bp differences, we obtained EF593327 and EF593328 from strains ARSEF4360 and EMA26, respectively, from Orthezia praelonga in Brazil (Marcelino et al. 2008). These two strains were identified as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. ortheziidae and are known to have entomopathogenic activity against the scale insect Orthezia praelonga. They are apparently being used effectively as a biological control agent against this insect in Brazil (Cesnik et al. 1996, Cesnik & Ferraz 2000). Several of the strains listed above are included in this study.
Colletotrichum orchidophilum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800507. Fig. 21.
Etymology: Named for the host plants from which the species is known, all of which belong to the Orchidaceae.
Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1.5–7 µm in diameter, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores and setae are formed directly on hyphae. Setae are abundant, medium brown, with the basal cell often paler, smooth-walled, 1–2-septate, 40–80 µm long, with a cylindrical base measuring 2–4.5 µm in diameter and a somewhat acute tip. Conidiophores are pale to medium brown, septate, branched, smooth-walled, and up to 60 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to medium brown, usually smooth-walled, though some warted conidiogenous cells were observed, cylindrical with a slime sheath, measuring 7–18 × 2.5–5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette of 0.5 µm long, showing conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with one end round and the other somewhat acute, measuring (10.5–)11.5–14(–16.5) × (2–)3–3.5(–4) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.7 ± 1.1 × 3.1 ± 0.3 µm, and a length/width ratio of 4.1. Conidia of strain CBS 631.80 are larger, measuring (13–)13.5–17.5(–19) × 2.5–3.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.4 ± 2.1 × 3.0 ± 0.3 µm, and a length/width ratio of 5.1. Appressoria were not observed in the type, but they are present in strain IMI 305357, occurring singly or at periodic intervals along hyphae, dark brown, smooth-walled, elliptical, pyriform, or spathulate, measuring (5.5–)7.5–15.5(–20.5) × (4.5–)5.5–8.5(–12) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.6 ± 3.9 × 7.0 ± 1.6 µm, and a length/width ratio of 1.6. Appressoria of strain CBS 631.80 are smaller, measuring (4.5–)5.5–11(–18) × (4–)4.5–6(–7) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.2 ± 2.8 × 5.2 ± 0.8 µm, and a length/width ratio of 1.6. In SNA cultures of strains IMI 305357 and CBS 119291, no setae were observed.
Morphological Characteristics: Conidia measurements: 0.9 × 3.3 ± 0.3 µm, with a length/width (L/W) ratio of 4.0.
On SNA (Synthetic Nutrient Agar), colonies are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, lacking aerial mycelium. The medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stems are partly covered with acervuli, which appear as tiny black spots visible from the reverse side. The growth rate is between 17.5–22.5 mm in 7 days (32.5–36 mm in 10 days).
On OA (Oat Agar), colonies are flat with an entire margin; the surface is olivaceous to grey olivaceous, covered with black or salmon acervuli, and lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse side is olivaceous to olivaceous grey, with a growth rate of 18–26 mm in 7 days (30–37.5 mm in 10 days). The conidia in mass appear salmon-colored. Isolate IMI 309357 differs by forming a felty white to olivaceous buff or grey aerial mycelium on OA and Anthriscus stems.

Germany, Munich: Glasshouses of Botanical Garden, on dead and dying leaves of Eria javanica (syn. E. stellata), April 1895, J.E. Weiss (M-0140831 syntype of C. orchidearum, named as forma eriae and lectotype of C. orchidearum, here designated); on both sides of dying leaves of Cymbidium aloifolium (syn. C. pendulum), April 1895, J.E. Weiss (M-0140830 syntype of C. orchidearum, named as C. orchidearum forma cymbidii); on dead and dying leaves of Stelis emarginata (syn. Physosiphon loddigesii), April 1895, J.E. Weiss (M-0140832 syntype of C. orchidearum, named as forma physosiphonis).
Notes: Diagnostic features for C. orchidophilum include its very narrow (usually 3–3.5 µm wide) cylindrical conidia, abundantly formed setae, and dark brown, uniformly shaped, pyriform to spathulate appressoria. Colletotrichum orchidophilum is basal to the C. acutatum species complex (fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue) and is therefore used as an outgroup in the phylogeny of the C. acutatum complex (Fig. 1). This species is associated with a range of genera in the Orchidaceae. According to BLASTn searches with ITS sequences, C. orchidophilum has possibly also been found on other orchids in different countries: on Cycnoches aureum in Panama (DQ286148, Farr et al. 2006), on Pleione sp. (AJ301980, Nirenberg et al. 2002), and as an endophyte of Dendrobium nobile in China (FJ042519, Yuan et al. 2009). As far as we can tell, C. orchidophilum is restricted to the Orchidaceae.
Colletotrichum orchidophilum differs from C. orchidearum in its formation of much narrower conidia. The conidia of C. orchidearum forma eriae measure (13.5–) 15.5–19.5 × 5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.2 ± 1.6 × 5.6 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.1 (n = 20). In contrast, the conidia of forma physosiphonis measure (14–) 16–18.5 × 5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.2 ± 1.1 × 5.5 ± 0.3 µm, also having an L/W ratio of 3.1 (n = 20). C. orchidearum was described by Allescher (1902) based on three diseased orchid plants collected from the glasshouses of the Munich botanic garden. Each collection was assigned a separate name at the forma rank, as listed above. Although no forma orchidearum was officially named, that designation comes into effect upon the description of the other forms (Art. 26). The species account included a description of the overall taxon and compared it with C. macrosporum, another orchid species described by Saccardo (1896) from a Brazilian collection. Saccardo noted that C. macrosporum has substantially larger conidia than those of C. orchidearum (measurements of 28–32 × 8–10 µm were reported), and its relationships remain unknown. One of the forms introduced by Allescher, forma cymbidii, is invalidly published as it lacks a description.
There are three dried specimens in the Allescher collections at M, all gathered by Dr. J.E. Weiss in April 1895, which clearly constitute type material. Specimen M-0140830 is named C. orchidearum forma cymbidii from Cymbidium aloifolium (syn. C. pendulum), M-0140831 is named forma eriae from Eria javanica (syn. E. stellata), and M-0140832 is named forma physosiphonis from Stelis emarginata (syn. Physosiphon loddigesii). The collection on Cymbidium appears to be effete; although a few of the conidiomata contained setae, no conidia or conidiogenous cells were observed. This may explain why C. orchidearum forma cymbidii was not described in the original publication. It is necessary to designate one of these authentic collections as the lectotype of C. orchidearum to clarify the application of that name, and we therefore choose M-0140831 for this purpose, as M-0140830 is effete and M-0140832 is rather depauperate. This decision renders C. orchidearum forma eriae an obligate synonym of C. orchidearum forma orchidearum. No significant morphological differences exist between the material from Eria and that from Physosiphon. The conidiomata of the invalid forma cymbidii are substantially larger than those of the two validly published forms, and the host plant material shows significant blackening in their immediate vicinity. The significance of this distinction remains unclear; it may be related more to the host than the fungus.
Yang et al. (2011) reviewed species of Colletotrichum from orchids in southwestern China. They identified one clade as C. orchidearum, and their Chinese strain appears to share close similarities with the type of that species. None of the species treated by Yang et al. belong to the C. acutatum complex.
Colletotrichum paxtonii Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800508.
Etymology: Named after Sir Joseph Paxton, gardener to William Spencer Cavendish, 6th Duke of Devonshire, who first cultivated the Cavendish banana.
n=13.0±2.6×3.7±0.3μm, and the length/width (L/W) ratio is 3.5. Appressoria are found singly or in loose groups, are medium brown, smooth-walled, and can be subglobose, elliptical, or clavate, with edges that are either undulate or entire. Their dimensions range from (5–)6–11.5(–16.5) µm × (3.5–)5.5–7.5(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.8 ± 2.7 µm × 6.5 ± 1.1 µm, yielding an L/W ratio of 1.4. The strain CBS 502.97 forms smaller appressoria, measuring (3.5–)4.5–7.5(–10.5) × (3–)3.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 6.0 ± 1.7 µm × 4.2 ± 0.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.4.
The asexual morph on the Anthriscus stem presents conidiomata that are acervular, with conidiophores formed on pale brown, angular basal cells measuring 3.5–7.5 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can grow up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 7–19 × 2–3 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes that are 1–1.5 µm long, showing distinct periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends being ± acute, though one end may be rounded. Their dimensions are (6.5–)12–15.5(–17) × (3–)3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.7 ± 1.8 µm × 3.8 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.6.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies grown on SNA are flat to raised with an entire margin, appearing hyaline. On filter paper, they are partly pale olivaceous grey, and on the medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stem, they are partly covered with thin, floccose white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and orange acervuli. The reverse side is hyaline to pale cinnamon, and the growth is recorded at 23–24.5 mm in 7 days (34–36.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, covered with floccose rosy buff to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and orange acervuli, with a reverse that is pale vinaceous, hazel, olivaceous grey to iron grey. The growth rate here is 22.5–23 mm in 7 days (33.5–35.5 mm in 10 days). The conidia appear orange in mass.
Material Examined: Specimens were collected from St. Lucia, from Musa sp. in 1972 by P. Griffee (holotype: IMI 165753, isotype: CBS H-20797, culture ex-type: IMI 165753). Another collection is from an unknown country in the West Indies, from Musa nana, with an unknown collection date, deposited in the CBS collection in February 1997 by J.A. Bailey. This strain, CBS 502.97, is equivalent to LARS 58, which was sterile upon receipt at CBS, but based on information from Sherriff et al. (1994), both strains originate from the same isolate.
Notes: The most prominent species of Colletotrichum associated with Musa species is C. musae, a central species in one of the major clades of the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). It was recently epitypified with a strain from Florida (Su et al. 2011). One strain we examined (CBS 502.97 = LARS 58) was first studied by Sherriff et al. (1994) under the misapplied name C. musae. However, Johnston & Jones (1997) confirmed it as a member of the C. acutatum complex. Notably, Colletotrichum paxtonii does not appear to produce setae at all, while C. musae rarely does, which may have contributed to past confusion between the two species.
There are no records of C. acutatum (s. lat.) on Musa according to Farr & Rossman (2012); however, several other species have been described on Musa spp. For instance, Colletotrichum cavendishii was described by Petrak (1925) with “elongated oblong, ellipsoid, oblong or ovate, almost cylindrical” conidia measuring 10–19 × 4.5–7 µm. This suggests that Petrak’s species may belong to the C. acutatum species complex and could potentially provide an earlier name for C. paxtonii, although its conidia are described as being substantially wider than those of the latter species—conidia in the C. acutatum species complex are rarely wider than 5 µm. Unfortunately, no cultures are available to evaluate this synonymy.
Another species on banana was described by Sawada (1959).
Additional species of Musa have been described in Gloeosporium. Gloeosporium musarum Cooke & Massee features elongate-ellipsoidal conidia with both ends rounded, measuring 12 × 4 µm, and was collected from ripe bananas in Brisbane, Australia (Cooke 1887). Besides the rounded conidia ends, the fungus displays characteristics aligning it with the C. acutatum complex. Glomerella musarum was identified from Musa paradisiaca in Sri Lanka and noted to associate with Gm. musarum and other fungi (Petch 1917). Unfortunately, we could not find the type material of either species to verify their taxonomic status. Gloeosporium musarum var. importatum, described in 1910 from fruits of Musa sapinea in Germany, has larger conidia than those of C. paxtonii, measuring 9–24 × 5–7 µm (Saccardo 1913). Gloeosporium lagenaria var. musarum was published without morphological details, rendering the name invalid. Gloeosporium lagenaria var. lagenaria has conidia larger than those of C. paxtonii, measuring 16–18 × 5–6 µm, and is generally considered a synonym of C. orbiculare (Cannon et al. 2012).
Colletotrichum paxtonii is distinguished from other species using TUB2 and GAPDH sequences, with TUB2 being the more reliable diagnostic marker. The GAPDH sequence shows only a one base pair difference from C. sloanei, while ACT, HIS3, and CHS-1 sequences match C. simmondsii. The closest TUB2 matches for strain IMI 165753, with 99% identity and 2 base pair differences, include AJ748635 from isolate PD 89/582 (associated with C. simmondsii), EU635505 from isolate DAR 32068 from Fragaria in Australia, EF143968 from isolate BRIP 4704a also from Fragaria, and FJ907443 from the ex-holotype culture of C. simmondsii from Carica papaya. For the GAPDH sequence of strain IMI 165753, no matches exceed 97% identity across the full sequence. Since the ITS sequence of C. paxtonii strain IMI 165753 matches several other Colletotrichum spp., there exists a long list of 100% matching sequences in GenBank, all from isolates of hosts other than Musa.

Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–5 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores are not observed. Conidiomata are absent, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to very pale brown, smooth-walled to finely verruculose.
The structure of conidiogenous cells is hyaline to pale brown, with smooth-walled to finely verruculose surfaces. They are cylindrical and elongate ampulliform, measuring 7.5–16.5 × 2.2–4.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette length of 1–2 µm, showing visible periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled or verruculose, aseptate, and straight, cylindrical to fusiform, with both ends acute or one end rounded and the other acute, measuring (17–)20–26(–35.5) × 4–5(–6.5) µm. The mean ± SD is 23.0 ± 3.2 × 4.6 ± 0.6 µm, with a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 5.1.
Appressoria are present either singly or in loose groups, medium to dark brown, predominantly oblong to irregular in outline, with edges that are entire or undulate, and occasionally lobate. Their dimensions are (4–)8.5–20.5(–32) × (2.5–)4–6(–8) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.5 ± 6.2 × 5.1 ± 1.0 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9. The appressoria of strain CBS 102054 are shorter, measuring (5.5–)8–13(–14.5) × 5–6.5(–8) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.4 ± 2.4 × 5.8 ± 0.8 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.8.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stems presents conidiomata as acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, roundish to angular cells measuring 2.5–10 µm in diameter. Setae are few, hyaline to medium brown, smooth-walled, and 0–1-septate, ranging from 25 to 70 µm in length, with a cylindrical base up to 5 µm in diameter, tapering to a roundish or acute tip. The conidiophores are pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching lengths of up to 50 µm. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, smooth-walled, usually cylindrical, occasionally elongate ampulliform, measuring 8–25 × 2.5–3.5(–5.5) µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette of 1 µm, and visible periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, measuring (14–)20–24.5(–25.5) × 4–4.5(–5) µm (one conidium measured 47 × 5 µm). The mean ± SD is 22.3 ± 2.3 × 4.3 ± 0.2 µm, with an L/W ratio of 5.2. The conidia of most other strains are slightly broader, and those of strain CBS 118191 are shorter than the conidia of the ex-epitype strain, measuring (14–)18.5–22(–24) × (4–)4.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 20.3 ± 1.9 × 4.9 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.1.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, hyaline, featuring felty white aerial mycelium on Anthriscus stems and filter paper, which is partially olivaceous to pale olivaceous grey on both sides. The growth rate is 15–19 mm in 7 days (27.5–32.5 mm in 10 days). On OA, colonies are also flat with entire margins; their surface is buff, with olivaceous to grey olivaceous sectors and roundish olivaceous grey structures embedded in the medium. The surface is partly covered with floccose-felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, and the reverse is buff with pale to dark olivaceous grey sectors, growing at a rate of 15–21 mm in 7 days (27.5–33.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon-colored.

Von Arx (1957) regarded Gloeosporium phormii as a synonym of C. gloeosporioides. However, in the phylogeny of Farr et al. (2006), strains of this species cluster with C. acutatum and C. lupini. Morphological and cultural differences revealed C. phormii as a distinct lineage, which we have confirmed in our study. Colletotrichum phormii can be distinguished from the closely related C. salicis (and indeed from all other species in the C. acutatum complex) by its elongate, large conidia and large appressoria. The species appears to be host-specific to Phormium spp. Recently, Takeuchi & Hori (2006) reported C. gloeosporioides from Phormium in Japan. However, based on dimensions of conidia (10–16.5 × 4–6 µm) and appressoria (7–17 × 4–11.5 µm) and the shape of the conidia—cylindrical with broadly rounded ends (see fig. 3 of that paper)—the fungus seems to belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex rather than one of the two C. acutatum complex members from Phormium treated in this study.
Colletotrichum phormii is differentiated from other species by the TUB2, GAPDH, HIS3, and ACT sequences, most effectively with HIS3. The CHS-1 sequence matches that of C. australe. The closest matches in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 118194 (with 99% identity, 4 bp differences) were Ga. acutata isolate PCF 459 (EU635504) from strawberry in Belgium (Debode et al. 2009) and with 99% identity (5 bp differences), isolate PT250 (= CBS 129953) AJ748624 from olive, Portugal (Talhinhas et al. 2005), which is referred to here as C. rhombiforme. With the GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 118194, there was no match closer than 89% identity. The closest matches in a blastn search with the ITS sequence, which showed 100% identity, were the same GenBank accessions obtained in blastn searches of C. salicis, C. pyricola, and C. johnstonii.
Colletotrichum pseudoacutatum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800509.
Etymology: The name refers to the morphology that is similar to C. acutatum, which is not closely related.
The sexual morph was not observed. The asexual morph was found on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–5 µm in diameter, are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown angular cells measuring 3–8 µm in diameter. Setae are rare (only one found), medium brown, smooth-walled, 2-septate, 57 µm long, with a cylindrical base that is constricted at the basal septum (4 µm in diameter) and a somewhat rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 50 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, often somewhat bent or partially inflated, measuring 9–22 × 2–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1 µm in diameter; the collarette is distinct, measuring 0.5–1 µm long, with conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, fusiform to cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (9.5–) 11.5–13.5(–14.5) × 3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.7 ± 1.1 × 3.8 ± 0.2 µm, yielding a length/width ratio of 3.4. Appressoria are found in loose groups to dense clusters, pale brown, verruculose, and irregularly shaped, measuring (3–) 5.5–18.5(–25) × (2.5–) 3.5–7(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.0 ± 6.3 × 5.1 ± 1.7 µm, yielding a length/width ratio of 2.3.
The measurements are ± 1.2 × 4.2 ± 0.3 µm, with a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 3.5.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA appear flat with undulate to lobate margins, hyaline and pale honey-colored in the center, lacking aerial mycelium. The filter paper shows a grey and mottled appearance, while on the Anthriscus stem, the colonies are partly covered with salmon to apricot acervuli. The growth rate is between 13.5 and 17.5 mm in 7 days (23–26 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are also flat with undulate to lobate margins; the surface is buff with isabelline mottled sectors and covered with salmon to apricot acervuli. Aerial mycelium is absent, and the reverse side is salmon with mottled olivaceous grey, while the center is iron-grey. The growth rate on OA is 15–21 mm in 7 days (21–27.5 mm in 10 days). The conidia appear in mass and are salmon to apricot in color.
Material Examined: Collected in Chile, Valdivia, from the San Patricio forest nursery of the Corporación Nacional Forestal near San José de la Mariquina, from seedlings of Pinus radiata between December 1976 and February 1977 by an unknown collector. This specimen was isolated and deposited in the CBS collection in August 1977 by H. Peredo López (CBS H-20729 holotype, culture ex-holotype CBS 436.77).
Notes: Peredo et al. (1979) reported a disease affecting Pinus radiata seedlings in a nursery in Chile. The seedlings exhibited bent leaders similar to the “terminal crook” disease observed in New Zealand (Dingley & Gilmor 1972), with the affected portion of the stem turning pinkish. This disease resulted in small seedlings with thick stems.
Table Description: The table presents measurements of appressoria from various strains of Colletotrichum. It includes columns for species, accession numbers, appressoria dimensions on SNA (length × width in µm), and the corresponding length-to-width ratios. Each row provides specific data for different strains, such as CBS 128530, which has appressoria measuring between 9–14(–16.5) × 5–7.5(–9.5) µm, with a noted L/W ratio. The dimensions vary significantly across different strains, reflecting a range of morphological characteristics important for identification and classification within this genus. The measurements are noted with ranges and variances, illustrating the diversity present among the strains studied.
This table summarizes the measurements of appressoria on SNA for various species of the Colletotrichum acutatum complex. The species are listed alongside their accession numbers, with two sets of appressoria dimensions given in micrometers (µm). Each measurement includes a minimum, mean, standard deviation, and maximum value, formatted as (min–)mean±stdev(max–). The length and width ratios (L/W ratio) are also provided.
For example, C. walleri has multiple entries with varying lengths and widths, such as CBS 465.83 which measures between 8 and 14 µm in length and 5 to 8 µm in width, indicating significant variability. Other species, like CBS 120708, range from 4.5 to 9 µm in length and 4.5 to 7.5 µm in width, demonstrating a similar pattern of diversity in appressoria dimensions across the samples listed. This highlights the morphological variability within the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, which is critical for identification and classification purposes.
Strain CBS 436.77 is not closely related to C. acutatum f. pineum, which belongs to C. acutatum s. str. (Fig. 1). Colletotrichum pseudoacutatum is at best basal to the C. acutatum species complex and forms a sister group to a clade containing the C. acutatum complex and C. orchidophilum (Fig. 2 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The closest matches found in a BLASTn search of the ITS sequence of strain CBS 436.77 (with only 94% identity) are unidentified Colletotrichum isolates, such as those from Podocarpaceae in New Zealand (Joshee et al. 2009), and several C. coccodes strains, including the ex-epitype strain CBS 164.49 (HM171678, Liu et al. 2011), C. trichellum strains MEP1535 (= CBS 118198, DQ286152, Farr et al. 2006) and DAOM 188792 (= CBS 125343, EU400142, incorrectly identified as C. dematium, Chen YY et al., unpubl. data), as well as “C. gloeosporioides” strains DAOM 183087 (EU400145, likely C. coccodes, Chen YY et al., unpubl. data) and BBA 71369 from Pleione (AJ301980, likely C. orchidophilum, Nirenberg et al. 2002). The closest matches with the TUB2 sequence showed only 82% identity, including C. trichellum strains HKUCC 10378, CBS 217.64, and CBS 118198 (GQ849447, Yang et al. 2009; GU228106, GU228107, Damm et al. 2009). There is no match across the entire GAPDH sequence of this species.
Morphologically, C. pseudoacutatum mainly differs from species in the C. acutatum complex by the formation of pale brown, verruculose, irregularly shaped appressoria and the more abundant formation of setae.
Colletotrichum pyricola Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800510. Fig. 25.
Etymology: Named after the host plant Pyrus communis.
The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph is found on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–8 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 9–25 × 2.5–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, and visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, fusiform to cylindrical with one end slightly acute and the other end rounded or slightly acute, measuring (10–) 14.5–18.5(–24) × (3.5–) 4.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.7 ± 2.1 × 4.7 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.5. Appressoria occur singly or in small dense clusters, are pale brown, smooth-walled, and ellipsoidal to clavate or cylindrical, with edges entire or undulate, measuring (4.5–) 6–16(–22) × (3.5–) 4.5–7(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.1 ± 5.1 × 5.7 ± 1.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.0.
The asexual morph occurs on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are acervular, and conidiophores are formed on pale brown, angular, basal cells measuring 3–7 µm in diameter. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 40 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 11–20 × 3–4 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter, a collarette of 0.5–2 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, fusiform to cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (9.5–) 14–17(–18.5) × (4–) 4.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.4 ± 1.6 × 4.8 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.2.
Material Examined: New Zealand, Waikato, from fruit rot of Pyrus communis, 1 Jun. 1988, unknown collector (deposited in ICMP collection by P.R. Johnston), (CBS H-20810 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128531 = ICMP 12924 = PRJ 977.1).
Notes: This is the third species within clade 4, not clearly distinct from C. johnstonii using morphological or cultural characteristics, but with unique ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and HIS3 sequences. The ITS sequence of C. pyricola is identical to those of C. salicis, C. johnstonii, and C. phormii. Like C. johnstonii, C. pyricola appears to be endemic to New Zealand, but more data are needed to confirm its distribution. Strain CBS 128531 (= PRJ 977.1) is the only strain of this species available to us and was included in the C. acutatum group C by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Lardner et al. (1999), as well as in group F2 by Guerber et al. (2003). In the combined GS and GAPDH phylogeny in Guerber et al. (2003), a second strain grouped with C. pyricola, assigned as the only representative of their F5 group. However, this strain (PRJ 823) belongs to group B in Lardner et al. (1999), with a completely different RAPD banding pattern.
In contrast to apple, for which Colletotrichum species are listed as major pathogens causing bitter rot (González et al. 2006), pear trees seem to be rarely affected by anthracnose. Colletotrichum piri Noack was actually described from apple (listed as Pyrus malus, a synonym of Malus pumila) in Brazil, rather than from pear as its name suggests.
The closest match in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 128531 (with 98% identity, 10 bp differences) was AJ409294 isolate 90 from Fragaria in the UK (Talhinhas et al. 2002), as well as AJ748609, AJ748612–AJ748614, AJ748619–AJ748622, AJ748625 from olive isolates (Talhinhas et al. 2005). With the GAPDH sequence, there was no closer match than 89% identity.
Colletotrichum rhombiforme Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800511. Etymology: Named after the shape of the ascospores, which can be rhomboidal.
Sexual Morph: Developed on Anthriscus stem. Ascomata are globose to subglobose, pale brown, measuring 300–400 × 400–500 µm, glabrous, and ostiolate. The peridium is 8–14 µm thick, composed of pale to medium brown flattened angular cells, 6–16 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, and delicate. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses that are hyaline, septate, and branched at the base, measuring 35–80 × 3–5 µm, with the widest part at the base and rounded tips. Asci are cylindrical, measuring 55–73 × 9–11 µm, and are 8-spored. Ascospores are arranged uni- to bi-seriately, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, oval, fusiform, or rhomboidal, with one end ± acute and one end round or both ends round, sometimes slightly curved, measuring (11–)12.5–16(–17) × (4–)4.5–6(–7.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.1 ± 1.6 × 5.2 ± 0.8 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
Asexual Morph: Observed on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–8 µm in diameter, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores are formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often lacking a basal septum and continuous with the conidiophore. Discrete phialides measure 4–13 × 3–5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, and a distinct collarette measuring 1–2 µm long with periclinal thickening evident. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and straight cylindrical with one end round and the other end slightly acute, or both ends round, measuring (12–)12.5–17(–24) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.7 ± 2.1 × 5.0 ± 0.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9. Appressoria are single or in loose groups, medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, mostly clavate, elliptical, or ovate in outline, with edges that are entire or undulate, rarely lobate, measuring (5.5–)8–13(–17.5) × (4.5–)6–8(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.6 ± 2.4 × 7.0 ± 1.1 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
Morphological Measurements: Conidia measured (3.5–)4–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.1 ± 3.5 × 4.8 ± 0.6 µm, and a length/width ratio of 2.9.
Culture Characteristics: On SNA, colonies are flat with an entire margin, appearing hyaline to pale cinnamon. On filter paper and Anthriscus stems, the medium is covered with short, floccose-felty pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, with pale grey to black structures on the Anthriscus stems. The reverse side of the medium is hyaline to pale cinnamon, while the filter paper appears pale cinnamon to olivaceous grey. The growth rate is between 20–22.5 mm in 7 days (32.5–37.5 mm in 10 days). On OA, colonies are also flat with an entire margin; the surface is honey-colored, pale olivaceous grey, and grey olivaceous, almost entirely covered with floccose-felty pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium. The reverse is pale olivaceous grey, transitioning to grey olivaceous.
Figures: The figure depicts various structures of Colletotrichum rhombiforme (from ex-holotype strain CBS 129953). It includes conidiomata (A–B), conidiophores (C–H), appressoria (I–M), conidia (N–O), ascomata (P), peridium in cross section (Q), outer surface of peridium (R), ascospores (S), paraphyses (T), asci (U–W, Y), and the apical region of the ascus (X). Specimens labeled A, C–E, N, and P–Y were sourced from Anthriscus stems, while B, F–M, and O were from SNA. The scale bars indicate measurements: A = 200 µm, B and P = 100 µm, C and Q = 10 µm, with the scale bar of C applying to C–O and Q to Q–Y.
The Colletotrichum acutatum Species Complex: On the growth medium, colonies are iron grey with a growth rate of 19–21 mm in 7 days (29–32.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear in mass, ranging from whitish to pale salmon.
Portugal: Mirandela, Torre de D. Chama, collected from anthracnose on Olea europaea, December 2003, P. Talhinhas (CBS H-20724 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129953 = PT250).
USA: Washington, Long Beach, from Vaccinium macrocarpon, 1993, Carris, culture CBS 131322 = DAOM 233523.
Notes: Talhinhas et al. (2005, 2009, 2011) reported a diverse range of C. acutatum isolates from olive fruit with anthracnose symptoms in Portugal. One strain, PT250 (=CBS 129953), was significantly divergent from other groups within C. acutatum based on ITS and beta-tubulin sequences, leading to its placement in the new clade A6. Talhinhas’s olive strain forms the type of C. rhombiforme. A second strain identified as C. rhombiforme was isolated from Vaccinium macrocarpon in the USA, studied by Robideau et al. (2008). Additional representatives of this clade likely include those isolated from Rhododendron in Sweden and Latvia (strains S2, L3, L4, L5, L6) reported by Vinnere et al. (2002) as belonging to clade A6 by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) based on ITS sequencing. Further sequencing of additional genes would be necessary for confirming this placement.
A variety of Glomerella rufomaculans, specifically Ga. rufomaculans var. vaccinii Shear, was described from the leaves of Vaccinium macrocarpon in New Jersey, USA. Its conidia and ascospores match the size of C. rhombiforme, with conidia described as oblong-cylindric, subclavate, and sometimes slightly curved (Shear 1907). This variety was incorrectly listed as Ga. fructigena var. vaccinii in Sylloge Fungorum (Saccardo & Trotter 1913). Both MycoBank and Index Fungorum classify this taxon as a separate species, Ga. rufomaculans-vaccinii Shear, with MycoBank listing it also as an orthographic variant. However, a strain (CBS 124.22) deposited in 1922 by L.C. Shear, labeled as Ga. rufomaculans var. vaccinii, lacks host information and belongs to the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012).
Colletotrichum rhombiforme is closely related to C. acerbum, C. australe, C. kinghornii, and C. phormii, which together form a sister clade to C. salicis.
Colletotrichum rhombiforme is distinguishable from other species by all sequences studied, except for the CHS-1 sequence, which is identical to that of C. acerbum. It can be most accurately identified using the TUB2 and ITS sequences. The closest match in a BLASTn search using the TUB2 sequence from CBS 129953, with 100% identity, was AJ748624, a sequence generated from the same isolate by Talhinhas et al. (2005). All other isolates showed ≤ 97% sequence identity. For the GAPDH sequence, no matches exceeded 88% identity. The closest matches with the ITS sequence, which also had 100% identity, included AJ749700 from isolate PT250 (equivalent to CBS 129953) (Talhinhas et al. 2005), as well as sequences AF411704, AF411706, AF411707, and AF411719 from Rhododendron isolates L3, L5, L6, and S2 from Latvia and Sweden (Vinnere et al. 2002). There was also a match with 99% identity (1 bp difference) from AF411705, which originated from Rhododendron isolate L4 (Vinnere et al. 2002), and EF672241 from Vaccinium isolate DAOM 233253 (equivalent to CBS 131322), the other isolate of C. rhombiforme included in this study (Robideau et al. 2008).
Colletotrichum salicis (Fuckel) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB800518. Fig. 27. Basionym: Sphaeria salicis Fuckel, Jahrb. nass. Ver. Naturk. 23–24: 115. 1870.
It was initially described as Sphaeria salicis Auersw. in 1864 (nomen nudum).
Later, it was placed under various genera such as Physalospora and Plectosphaera, before being reassigned to Colletotrichum.
Notably, Glomerella species and other related taxa are also associated with this name.
The sexual morph of C. salicis develops on the stem of Anthriscus. The ascomata are globose to pyriform, ostiolate, medium brown, darker toward the ostiole, measuring 150–200 × 185–250 µm. The peridium is 10–15 µm thick, made up of pale to medium brown flattened angular cells that are 5–15 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, and delicate. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses that are hyaline, septate, measuring 30–80 × 2–3.5 µm, with the widest part at the base and round tips. The asci are cylindrical, measuring 55–88 × 8–12 µm, and contain eight spores. The ascospores are arranged uni- to biseriately, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, and can be ovoid, fusiform, cigar-shaped, or cylindrical, with one end acute and the other obtuse or both ends obtuse. They may be very slightly curved, measuring (12.5–)13–15(–17) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.1 ± 1.1 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6.
Fig. 27. Colletotrichum salicis (from ex-epitype strain CBS 607.94).
Scale bars: A, Q, R = 100 µm; C, S = 10 µm. The scale bar of A applies to A–B, while the scale bar of C applies to C–P, and the scale bar of S applies to S–Y.
Asexual Morph on Anthriscus Stem: Conidiomata are acervular and only form after approximately 14 days. The conidiophores are developed on a cushion of pale brown angular cells, measuring 3.5–8.5 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, either simple or septate and branched, with lengths up to 30 µm. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 11–18 × 2.5–4 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, a collarette of 0.5 µm long, and visible periclinal thickening.
Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, with one end rounded and the other end slightly acute to truncate, measuring (14.5–)16–18.5(–20) × (4–)4.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.1 ± 1.3 × 4.9 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.5. Conidia from strain CBS 115.14 are smaller, measuring (9.5–)11.5–16(–18.5) × (2.5–)3–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.0 ± 2.3 × 3.3 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.2.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, with filter paper appearing rose to iron-grey, and exhibit felty to woolly, white to olivaceous grey aerial mycelium on both Anthriscus stem and filter paper. The reverse shows the same colors, with a growth rate of 18–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–36 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are also flat with an entire margin, featuring a surface that is pale amber, ochraceous to apricot, almost completely covered by felty to floccose-felty, white, pale luteous to very pale olivaceous aerial mycelium, with the reverse appearing rosy buff, ochraceous, cinnamon to buff; growth rate is 21–27 mm in 7 days (34–37.5 mm in 10 days). The conidia appear in mass as pale salmon.

Notes: Colletotrichum salicis is unusual among Colletotrichum species due to the prominence of sexual structures relative to asexual structures. It is one of the few species known to produce fertile ascomata in culture, and these ascomata are frequently found on dead and dying, weakly lignified tissues, including young stems, bracts, and flower/fruit stalks of Salix species. A lack of distinctive features has led to this species being described as new multiple times.
Sphaeria salicis has been transferred to a variety of different sexual morph genera. In 1954, it was moved to the rather ambiguous genus Plectosphaera (von Arx & Müller, 1954; Cannon, 1991) and later, in 2000, to Glomerella (Holm & Ryman, 2000).
Phyllachora amenti was described from Salix reticulata in Dovre, Norway, by Rostrup (1891). Von Arx & Müller (1954) transferred the species to Glomerella, apparently not recognizing its similarities with Plectosphaera salicis. Although we have not seen Rostrup’s type specimen, both his description and that of von Arx & Müller closely resemble C. salicis, leading us to confidently assert their synonymy. Rostrup also described a putative asexual morph of Phyllachora amenti with filiform septate conidia measuring 35–45 × 1 µm, formed in pycnidia. This is likely an accompanying species rather than a genetically linked morph and may correspond to Septoria didyma.
Physalospora miyabeana was described from Salix purpurea var. angustifolia in Japan by Fukushi (1921) and later combined into Glomerella by von Arx (1957) as Glomerella miyabeana. The pathology of this fungus was detailed by Nattrass (1928), based on British collections from Salix viminalis. He noted that this species showed similarities to Physalospora salicis and identified his collections as P. miyabeana due to the presence of a Gloeosporium (i.e., Colletotrichum) asexual morph noted by Fukushi. He concluded that the species was more closely related to Glomerella than to Physalospora. Further contributions on its pathology were made by Butin (1960).
Glomerella lycopersici was described from a mummified fruit of Solanum lycopersicum (formerly Lycopersicon esculentum) in Germany. The ex-syntype strain CBS 115.14 sporulates minimally and did not form a sexual morph in culture, but molecular data confirm its synonymy. The original ascospore measurements (15–17.3 × 5.8–6.9 µm) provided by Krüger (1913) differ slightly from our measurements, and the conidia measurements (20–22 × 4.7–6.9 µm) differ even more, likely due to the use of different growth media. Nevertheless, the shapes of the ascospores (one side often nearly straight and the other side convex or irregularly biconvex) and conidia (often clavate) align with those of strain CBS 607.94. Another potential synonym is Guignardia salicina (syn. Physalospora salicina, Glomerella salicina), although we have not accessed the original description or examined type material.
Colletotrichum lucidae was described from living leaves of Salix lucida in Wisconsin, USA, by Greene (1956). It produces obtuse cylindrical conidia (13–19 × 4–6.5 µm) and 1–2-septate setae (50–65 × 4–5 µm). It may also be a synonym of C. salicis. Greene (1964) later found the species on S. pyrifolia. The strains we examined did not produce setae, suggesting that if C. lucidae is conspecific, it would simply be a later synonym of C. salicis.
Johnston & Jones (1997) found that C. salicis (under the name Ga. miyabeana) had a close genetic affinity to C. acutatum. Vinnere (2004) considered Ga. miyabeana to be the sexual morph of one of the biological groups within C. acutatum s. lat., proposing it should be recognized as a separate species. This is corroborated by our study. Colletotrichum salicis forms a sister clade to a group formed by C. phormii, C. rhombiforme, C. acerbum, C. australe, and...
According to our study, C. salicis is not restricted to a single host genus but seems to prefer woody hosts such as Acer, Araucaria, Malus, Populus, Pyrus, and especially Salix. As noted by Farr & Rossman (2012), Glomerella amenti has been recorded on Salix polaris and S. reticulata in Norway (Holm & Holm 1994). Additionally, G. miyabeana has been documented on Salix amygdaloides, S. babylonica, S. daphnoides, S. fragilis, S. gooddingii, S. lasiolepis, S. × alba-matsudana, Fragaria × ananassa, Malus domestica, and Pyrus pyrifolia in New Zealand (Pennycook 1989; Guerber et al. 2003; Gadgil 2005). It has also been reported on Salix species in Poland (Mulenko et al. 2008) and the UK (Dennis 1986), as well as on Acer truncatum in China (Sun et al. 2011). This species has been associated with leaf lesions on Salix fragilis, S. alba var. vitellina, and S. cinerea in Australia (Cunnington et al. 2007). Johnston & Jones (1997) suggested that G. miyabeana, which causes the distinctive disease known as "twig canker" on Salix species, typically occurs on fruits (strawberry, apple, nashi, tomato) as an opportunistic secondary invader, often infecting fruits from willow trees commonly used as orchard shelter belts in New Zealand. Cunnington et al. (2007) tested the pathogenicity of strains from Salix species in Australia on apple and nashi fruits, finding them positive for pathogenicity but less aggressive than a different C. acutatum s. lat. strain from apple fruit. All Colletotrichum strains from Salix species in the CBS collection belong to the former species.
Colletotrichum salicis is differentiated from other species by all genes except for ITS. It forms a well-supported clade (bootstrap support 98–99%) with minimal sequence variation in HIS3, TUB2, GAPDH, and ACT. The closest match in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of CBS 607.94 (showing 97% identity with 13 bp differences) was G. acutata isolate PCF 459 (EU635504) from strawberry in Belgium (Debode et al. 2009). For the GAPDH sequence of CBS 607.94, no match closer than 87% identity was found. In blastn searches with the ITS sequence, numerous matches with 100% identity were identified, some belonging to distinct species.
Colletotrichum scovillei Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800512.
Etymology: Named after Wilbur Lincoln Scoville (1865–1942), who devised the Scoville scale for measuring the "hotness" of chili peppers, the host plant of this species.
The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph was found on SNA, featuring vegetative hyphae that are 1–5.5 µm in diameter, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were absent, and acervuli were not developed; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled to verruculose, septate, branched, and can reach up to 50 µm in length. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slightly inflated, measuring 8–18 × 3–4 µm, with openings that are 1–2 µm in diameter, and have a collarette 1–1.5(–2) µm long with conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to clavate, with one end rounded and the other end ± acute, measuring (10.5–) 12.5–15(–16.5) × (3–) 3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.7 ± 1.3 × 3.8 ± 0.3 µm, yielding a length/width ratio of 3.6. The conidia of strain CBS 120708 are narrower, measuring (11.5–) 12.5–14.5(–15) × 3–3.5 µm.
Morphological Characteristics: The asexual morph was observed on the stem of Anthriscus. The conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores arising from pale brown, angular, basal cells measuring 3–8.5 µm in diameter. In strain CBS 126529, setae were not observed; however, in strain CBS 120708, setae were medium brown, smooth-walled, 1–2-septate, measuring 40–60 µm long, with a cylindrical to inflated base, and a diameter of 3.5–8 µm, rounded at the top. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 30 µm in length. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 9–23 × 2.5–3.5 µm, with an opening diameter of 1.5–2 µm, a collarette of 1 µm in length, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform, with both ends slightly acute or one end rounded, measuring (9–) 14.5–18 (–19.5) × 3.5–4.5 µm. The mean ± SD is 16.0 ± 1.8 × 4.0 ± 0.3 µm, with an L/W ratio of 4.0. For strain CBS 120708, conidia were smaller, measuring (12.5–) 13–16 (–18) × (3–) 3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 1.4 × 3.6 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.1.
Cultural Characteristics: Colonies grown on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, appearing pale olivaceous grey on filter paper. On medium, filter paper, and the Anthriscus stem, they are partly covered with floccose, whitish to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, and on the stem, a few orange acervuli are present. The reverse is hyaline, transitioning to rosy buff to greyish sepia on filter paper and the Anthriscus stem, which appears partly fuscous black. The growth rate is 22–22.5 mm in 7 days (33.5–35 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, with a surface covered in short floccose, whitish to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium; the margin appears rosy buff, while the reverse is rosy buff, with olivaceous grey to iron grey at the center, growing 19–20 mm in 7 days (33–35 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear salmon-colored in mass.
Indonesia: From Capsicum sp.; collection date and collector unknown (CBS H-20792 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 126529 = BBA 70349 = PD 94/921-3).
Thailand: Chiang Mai, Sansai; from anthracnose on fruit of Capsicum annuum (chili), collected in 2005 by P.P. Than; culture CBS 120708 = HKUCC 10893.
Notes: Colletotrichum scovillei belongs to clade 2 of the C. acutatum species complex and can be differentiated from other species using TUB2, GAPDH, and ACT sequences, with GAPDH being the most clearly differential. The CHS-1 and HIS3 sequences are identical to those of C. guajavae. The conidia are slightly longer than typical for C. simmondsii and C. nymphaeae, exhibiting a larger length/width ratio. However, these characteristics can vary within the clade, necessitating sequence data for reliable distinction between the taxa.
The ex-type strain was included in the study by Nirenberg et al. (2002) as C. acutatum, and strain CBS 120708 was part of research on Colletotrichum diseases of chili in Thailand (Than et al. 2008a), where ITS and TUB2 sequences were generated, identifying it as C. acutatum, a representative of one of two clades of that species complex associated with chili. In drop inoculation tests, strains from this clade were observed to cause typical anthracnose symptoms on chili fruits. Other species (or species complexes) causing chili diseases were reported by Than et al. (2008a), identifying isolates as C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici. The latter taxon was subsequently synonymized with C. truncatum by Damm et al. (2009). Additionally, other Colletotrichum species were reported from the C. boninese species complex, including C. novae-zelandiae and C. karstii from New Zealand.
The closest match in a BLASTn search with the GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 126529 (with 100% identity) was HM038335 from Colletotrichum sp. isolate MFU 090619, obtained from Capsicum annuum (chili) in Laos (Phoulivong et al. 2010). Among the closest matches with the TUB2 sequence, there were 100% identity matches with DQ454059 and DQ454060 from Capsicum annuum isolates obtained in Thailand (Than et al. 2008a). One of these isolates is included in this study. Another 100% match was with GU246633 from isolate R14 of Capsicum annuum in South Korea (Sang et al. 2011). All of these strains likely belong to C. scovillei. Based on the GAPDH sequence of strain LLB17, C. scovillei also occurs on Capsicum annuum in Taiwan (as part of group D3 in Guerber et al. 2003).
Colletotrichum simmondsii R.G. Shivas & Y.P. Tan, Fungal Diversity 39: 119. 2009. Fig. 29.
Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent; conidiophores form directly on hyphae on the surface of the medium and in the aerial mycelium. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, and rather irregular in form, sometimes septate. Conidiogenous cells are formed singly or in clusters of 2–3, apically or as lateral branches of conidiophores; they are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and thread-like, measuring 7–23 × 1–2.2 µm, with openings of 0.5 µm in diameter. A collarette is sometimes visible, less than 0.5 µm long, and periclinal thickening was not observed. Conidiogenous cells of other strains differ; for example, the conidiophores of CBS 294.67 are cylindrical, sometimes slightly inflated, and usually wider than the ex-type strain, measuring 4.5–18 × 1.5–4 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette measuring 0.5–1 µm long, with visible periclinal thickening.
Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with one end rounded and one end acute, or both ends acute, measuring (4.5–)6.5–10(–11.5) × (2–)2.5–3.5(–4) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.1 ± 1.7 × 2.9 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7. Conidia of other strains differ in shape and size from the ex-type strain; for instance, conidia of CBS 294.67 are cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, measuring (6–)10.5–14(–16.5) × 3.5–4.5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.3 ± 1.8 × 4.0 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3. Appressoria are in loose groups or dense clusters of 2–6, medium brown, round, elliptical to clavate in outline, with margins entire to undulate, measuring (4.5–)6–9.5(–11.5) × (3.5–)4–6.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.8 ± 1.9 × 5.3 ± 1.1 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stems shows that conidiomata were not observed, and conidiophores were formed only on aerial hyphae. Setae were not observed in the ex-type strain, but a few were observed in other contexts.
In Fig. 29, various aspects of Colletotrichum simmondsii are depicted, with images labeled A–K and R–S sourced from strain CBS 294.67, while L–Q are from the ex-holotype strain CBS 122122. Specific illustrations include conidiomata, setae, conidiophores, and appressoria, showcasing structures from both Anthriscus stems and SNA. The scale bars vary: A is 200 µm, B is 100 µm, and D is 10 µm, with the scale bar for D applying to C–S.
Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to pale isabelline. On filter paper and on Anthriscus stems, they are partly covered with short, white to pale grey, felty aerial mycelium. The reverse side of the filter paper is white to olivaceous grey. Growth ranges from 10–16 mm in 7 days (16–26 mm in 10 days). Other strains differ from the type strain by growing faster; for example, CBS 294.67 grows 20.5–31 mm in 7 days (34–40 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is covered with felty white aerial mycelium, which becomes pale olivaceous grey towards the center. The margin is white or rosy buff, while the reverse is dark olivaceous grey or salmon and purplish to iron-grey towards the margin. Growth is 10–16 mm in 7 days (14–24 mm in 10 days), with faster-growing strains such as CBS 294.67, which grows 21–27 mm in 7 days (32.5–40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are not observed in the ex-type strain, but those of other strains are salmon-orange.

Colletotrichum simmondsii was described by Shivas & Tan (2009) to accommodate strains of the C. acutatum aggregate assigned to group A2 by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005). The type of C. simmondsii was erroneously designated as an epitype of C. acutatum (i.e., s.str.) by Than et al. (2008b) before Shivas & Tan (2009) recognized that the two taxa are not conspecific. In this paper, C. simmondsii is accepted in a more restricted sense. According to the TUB2 phylogeny in Shivas & Tan (2009, see fig. 2 of that paper), C. simmondsii includes strain BRIP 4684 from Capsicum, here identified as C. brisbanense, and sequences from GenBank belonging to strains of C. laticiphilum (AY376556) and C. nymphaeae (AY376551, AJ748607), as well as some strains from Litchi and Persea that could represent further segregate species of the C. acutatum species complex.
Conidial measurements of the type of C. simmondsii by Shivas & Tan (2009) are considerably larger (10–16 × 3.5–4.5 µm) than those in our study. This discrepancy may be due to the different growth medium they used (PDA) or the age of the culture. Measurements of all other strains studied in culture, including strain CBS 294.67, also from papaya in Australia, more closely approximate the measurements for C. simmondsii given by Shivas & Tan (2009).
The ex-holotype strain (CBS 122122) of C. simmondsii has restricted growth; all other isolates studied are much faster growing, especially CBS 294.67 on OA. Than et al. (2008b) also noted the slow growth rate of CBS 122122 (as BRIP 28519), providing measurements of 2.3–2.6 mm (presumably per day). CBS 111531 also differs, showing buff to olivaceous pigmentation on OA and white aerial mycelium.
Colletotrichum simmondsii is distinguishable from other species through GAPDH and TUB2 sequencing, with TUB2 being the more diagnostic marker. In contrast, the sequences for ACT, HIS3, and CHS-1 are identical to those of C. paxtonii. A BLASTn search using the TUB2 sequence from CBS 122122 yielded 100% matches with various sequences, including several from the main clade of C. simmondsii, as illustrated in the phylogeny by Shivas & Tan (2009; see Fig. 2 of that paper). Notable sequences matched include HE573031 from strain ITEM 13492 associated with Arbutus unedo in Italy (Polizzi et al., 2011), AJ748635 from strain PD 89/582 (CBS 126524) from Cyclamen sp. in the Netherlands (Talhinhas et al., 2005), and FJ907443 from strain BRIP 28519 (CBS 122122, ex-holotype) as reported by Prihastuti et al. (2009).
Colletotrichum sloanei Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800515. Fig. 30.
Etymology: This species is named in honor of Sir Hans Sloane (1660–1753), a physician and prominent natural history collector. His specimens significantly contributed to the original collections of the Natural History Museum in London. His Jamaican material of the host plant became Linnaeus’s type for Theobroma cacao, and his recipe for a milk chocolate drink was commercialized by the Cadbury brothers (Natural History Museum, 2011).
The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph was found on SNA, characterized by vegetative hyphae that are 1–8.5 µm in diameter, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed, and conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not detected. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, and can be simple or septate and branched. Conidiogenous cells are also hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to conical, sometimes lacking a basal septum, and can be continuous with the conidiophore. Polyphialides are occasionally observed, with discrete phialides measuring 8–24 × 2–3.5 µm, an opening of 1 µm in diameter, and a collarette measuring 1–1.5 µm long, displaying visible periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to clavate with one rounded end and one end that is approximately acute; they measure (8.5–)12–17(–22) × (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean of 14.4 ± SD = 3.7 ± 2.5 × ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.9. Appressoria can occur singly or in loose groups, medium brown, smooth-walled, elliptical to subglobose or clavate in shape, entire with undulate or lobate edges, measuring (4–)5–11(–17.5) × (4–)4.5–6.5(–8) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.0 ± 3.0 × 5.4 ± 0.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
The asexual morph was also found on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are either undeveloped or conidiophores form directly on hyphae or on a cushion of pale brown, angular basal cells measuring 2.5–6 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can be up to 40 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slightly inflated, measuring 9–18 × 2.5–4 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, exhibiting distinct periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, fusiform to cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (9–)11.5–15.5(–19.5) × (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.4 ± 1.8 × 3.9 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.5.
Culture characteristics: On SNA, colonies appear flat with entire margins, displaying a hyaline buff to pale honey coloration. On filter paper and Anthriscus stems, they may exhibit a pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey hue, with the medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stems partially covered by thin white aerial mycelium. The reverse side displays similar colors, with a growth rate of 21–24 mm in 7 days (31–34 mm in 10 days). On OA, colonies are flat with entire margins, featuring a surface that ranges from iron-grey to black with a buff margin, partly covered by thin felty white aerial mycelium and orange acervuli arranged in rings at the margin. The reverse is olivaceous grey with a buff margin, with a growth rate of 21–22.5 mm in 7 days (31–32.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear in mass as salmon to orange.
Material examined: Malaysia, Borneo, Sabah, Tuaran, collected from the leaf of Theobroma cacao in 1994 by A.R. Rossman and C.L. Bong (IMI 364297 holotype, CBS H-20796 isotype, culture ex-type IMI 364297).
C. ignotum, C. theobromicola, and C. tropicale were identified as endophytes of T. cacao by Rojas et al. (2010). Two of these species were considered to have the potential to protect host plants from Phytophthora diseases. All three have been reviewed by Weir et al. (2012).
Additionally, further Colletotrichum species have been described from T. cacao, including C. brachytrichum, found on leaves of T. cacao in Trinidad. This species has conidia that are ovoid-cylindrical with an attenuated base and a round apex, measuring 10–13.5 × 3–3.7 µm. It produces sparse setae that are dark brown, aseptate, slightly flexuous, and measure 40 × 3.5 µm, as well as conidiogenous cells measuring 4 × 2 µm (Saccardo 1906). In contrast, C. sloanei forms larger conidia, averaging 14.4 × 3.7 µm on SNA and 13.4 × 3.9 µm on Anthriscus stem. No setae were found in cultures of C. sloanei (though these may only form on host material), and its conidiogenous cells are much longer than those of C. brachytrichum.
Colletotrichum cradwickii, described from branches of T. cacao in Jamaica, produces hyaline (red in mass), elongate conidia that are constricted in the middle, measuring 14–17 × 5 µm. It also has straight, rigid, acute setae that are 2–3-septate, purplish, and measure 70–100 × 4–6 µm (Saccardo & Trotter 1913). Colletotrichum luxificum was collected from branches, buds, and fruits of T. cacao in Surinam and Demerara (now Guyana). It forms ovoid-oblong conidia, sometimes slightly constricted in the center, both sides rounded, smooth, measuring 13–19 × 4–5 µm. Setae formed are described as 2–4-septate, measuring 50–120 × 3.5–4.5 µm (Saccardo & Trotter 1913). Despite some size discrepancies, the constriction of the conidia and formation of setae for these two species are reminiscent of those in the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Colletotrichum theobromae forms oblong, straight conidia with obtuse ends, measuring 9–12 × 3–5 µm, and dark-brown, pluriseptate, acute setae measuring 60–75 × 3 µm (Saccardo 1906). It was found on fruits of T. cacao in Cameroon and does not align with the characteristics of C. sloanei. Gloeosporium theobromicola (as "theobromicolum"), found on fruits of T. cacao in Brazil, forms hyaline, fusoid conidia measuring 6–9 × 2–2.5 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931). These conidia are considerably smaller than those of C. sloanei and may not belong to the genus Colletotrichum.
None of the species previously described on T. cacao originates from Asia, and all known species from other parts of the world differ from C. sloanei. Rojas et al. (2010) noted several unidentified taxa among their collections from T. cacao in Panama. However, based on ITS sequence data, none belong to the C. acutatum species complex. They also isolated C. gloeosporioides s. lat. and a strain belonging to the C. boninense species complex (CBS 124951), which was identified as C. karstii by Damm et al. (2012).
Colletotrichum sloanei can be distinguished from other species based on TUB2, ACT, GAPDH, and HIS3 sequences, with the most distinct differences found using TUB2, HIS3, and ACT. There is only one base pair difference with GAPDH compared to C. paxtonii, while the CHS-1 sequence is identical to that of C. walleri. Closest matches in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain IMI 364297 show 99% identity.
The sequences with 2 or 3 base pair differences were GU183300, GU183299, and GU183295 from C. simmondsii strains collected from Litchi chinensis in Australia (Shivas & Tan, 2009). Although our analyses do not include strains from Litchi, the TUB2 tree presented in Shivas & Tan (2009) suggests that they likely belong to C. simmondsii s. str. The closest match to the GAPDH sequence of strain IMI 364297, covering approximately the full length of the sequence (with 98% identity and 6 bp differences), was HQ846719 from an unnamed plant, probably from India (Chowdappa P, Chethana CS, Madhura S, unpubl. data). The closest matches to the ITS sequence (with 99% identity and 1 bp difference) were 25 sequences, which are not listed here.
Colletotrichum tamarilloi Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800516. Fig. 31.
Etymology: Named after the host plant, tamarillo (Solanum betaceum).
The sexual morph has not been observed, although structures that may be immature ascomata were seen on Anthriscus stems. The asexual morph was found on SNA. The vegetative hyphae measured 1–5.5 µm in diameter, were hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; instead, conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and could grow up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to somewhat inflated, often integrated. Discrete phialides measured 8–18 × 2.5–3.5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter. The collarette was distinct, measuring 1–1.5 µm long, with a conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, and sometimes clavate with one rounded and one acute end. Their dimensions were (8.5–)11.5–14.5(–15) × (2.5–)3–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.0 ± 1.4 × 3.5 ± 0.4 µm, resulting in a length/width ratio of 3.7. Appressoria were single, medium brown, smooth-walled, subglobose, elliptical, or clavate, with entire edges, rarely slightly undulate, measuring (4–)5–10.5(–16) × (3.5–)4.5–6.5(–8) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.8 ± 2.6 × 5.5 ± 0.9 µm, yielding a length/width ratio of 1.4.
The asexual morph on Anthriscus stems featured acervular conidiomata, with conidiophores formed on thick-walled, pale brown, angular basal cells measuring 4–8 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and could grow up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and sometimes polyphialidic, measuring 10–21 × 2–4 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter. The collarette was distinct, measuring 1–2 µm long, with a conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, measuring (10.5–)12–16(–22) × (3–)3.5–4.5(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.0 ± 1.9 × 4.0 ± 0.4 µm, giving a length/width ratio of 3.5. The conidia of CBS 129955 and CBS 129811 differed by having slightly longer conidia, measuring (11.5–)13.5–17(–18.5) × 3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.3 ± 1.7 × 3.8 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in a length/width ratio of 4.0.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA were flat with entire margins, hyaline to pale honey in color. On filter paper, they appeared partly pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey, with parts of the Anthriscus stem and medium covered with felty white aerial mycelium (and salmon acervuli). The reverse showed similar colors, with a growth rate of 17.5–21.5 mm in 7 days (28.5–31.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA were flat with entire margins, the surface being honey, isabelline to olivaceous, almost entirely covered by felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium. The reverse colors ranged from buff to olivaceous, pale olivaceous grey, and olivaceous grey to iron-grey, with a growth rate of 16–18 mm in 7 days (26–29 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appeared salmon.
Material examined: Colombia, Cundinamarca, from fruit anthracnose of Solanum betaceum, 13 Aug. 2010, J. Molina (CBS H-20726 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129814 = T.A.6); Cundinamarca, from anthracnose on a fruit of Solanum betaceum, 13 Aug. 2010, J. Molina, culture CBS 129811 = T.A.3; Antioquia, Santa Rosa, from a flower of Solanum betaceum, 1998, collector unknown, CBS H-20728, culture CBS 129955 = Tom-12.
Colletotrichum tamarilloi can be distinguished from other species using sequences from CHS-1, HIS3, TUB2, and GAPDH, with GAPDH being the most effective. It forms a uniform cluster even when analyzed with six genes (Fig. 1). Afanador-Kafuri et al. (2003) observed consistent banding patterns using apPCR, RAPD-PCR, and A+T-rich DNA analyses of the strains studied. They speculated that selection for clonality and homogeneity had occurred among the isolates, all collected from a single region in Colombia where only one cultivar of the host was grown. The conidia of C. tamarilloi are uniformly fusiform on SNA and almost so on Anthriscus stems, while C. lupini typically produces clavate conidia on SNA and cylindrical ones on the stems. Furthermore, the appressoria of C. lupini exhibit an undulate to lobate margin, whereas those of C. tamarilloi have an entire or, rarely, slightly undulate edge.
This species is exclusively known on Solanum betaceum in Colombia, with no previously described species associated with this host. Three species of Colletotrichum are recorded from tamarillo in the USDA fungal databases (Farr & Rossman 2012): C. acutatum (Guerber et al. 2003, Gadgil 2005) and C. gloeosporioides (Gadgil 2005) in New Zealand, as well as C. simmondsii in Australia (Shivas & Tan 2009). None of these species or groups is identical to C. tamarilloi. Although C. lupini and C. tamarilloi form well-supported clusters, there are several additional species and unnamed strains from various hosts in Central and South America, including Florida, that are closely related to both C. lupini and C. tamarilloi. One of these strains was isolated from tamarillo in the same locality in Colombia (CBS 129810).
A recently reported anthracnose pathogen of tamarillo in the USA (Jones & Perez 2012) likely belongs to C. fioriniae, based on its ITS sequence (JN863589). The Colletotrichum strains available from tamarillo in Colombia and New Zealand include C. godetiae, C. tamarilloi, and an unnamed strain related to C. tamarilloi (this study), along with C. boninense, C. constrictum, and C. karstii, all belonging to the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012, this issue). Yearsley et al. (1988) reported infections of tamarillo by C. acutatum (s. lat.) in New Zealand; however, none of the tamarillo strains isolated from New Zealand belong to the C. acutatum group. The strains from this host included in Guerber et al. (2003), assigned to group F2, formed a clade with strains described as C. johnstonii in this study. No species has been found on tamarillo that occurs in both Colombia and New Zealand.
Falconi & van Heusden (2011) studied Colletotrichum isolates collected from Lupinus mutabilis and tamarillo in the Ecuadorian Andes. They identified two different subgroups within C. acutatum based on ITS sequence data. The isolates from lupins were pathogenic to tamarillo and vice versa, but each type was more virulent to its own host. The ITS sequence of the ex-type strain of C. tamarilloi, CBS 129814, matched with 100% identity to JN543070 from isolate Tam7 from tamarillo, as well as JN543066 from isolate Lup28 from L. mutabilis in Ecuador (Falconi et al. 2012).
The closest TUB2 BLASTn matches for CBS 129814 (with 99% identity, 4 bp differences) were FN611029 and FN611028 from isolates DPI and CS-1 from Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus sinensis from Florida, USA (Ramos et al. 2006). The closest GAPDH matches (with 97% identity) were EU647323 from leatherleaf fern and EU168905, EU647318, and EU647319 from sweet orange isolates, all from Florida, USA (Peres et al. 2008, MacKenzie et al. 2009).
Colletotrichum walleri Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800517. Fig. 32.
Etymology: Named in honor of J.M. Waller, a distinguished tropical pathologist and a key contributor to the understanding of the most significant Colletotrichum pathogen of coffee.
Conidiomata may be either not developed, or conidiophores are formed directly on hyphae, or acervular, with conidiophores emerging from pale brown, angular, basal cells measuring 3.5–7 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach lengths of up to 70 µm. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 12–23 × 2.5–3 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette of 0.5–1 µm long, and periclinal thickening that is visible to distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and sometimes slightly curved, cylindrical to fusiform, with both ends approximately acute or one end rounded, measuring (10.5–) 12–16(–18.5) × 3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.9 ± 1.8 × 4.0 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.5.
Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline in color, and filter paper appears pale olivaceous grey. The medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stem are covered with a felty white aerial mycelium, with the reverse exhibiting the same colors; the colonies grow 21–24 mm in 7 days (31–34 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, with the surface covered in felty or short floccose white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium. The reverse is olivaceous grey to iron grey, olivaceous in the center, and white towards the margin; growth is 20–26 mm in 7 days (30.5–37.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear salmon in mass.

Vietnam, Buon Ma Thuot-Dak Lac, from leaf tissue of Coffea arabica, unknown collection date, H. Nguyen (CBS H-20795 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 125472 = BMT(HL)19).
Species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex are well-known pathogens of Coffea, particularly the African coffee berry disease pathogen C. kahawae (Waller et al. 1993). Additional Coffea-associated components from this species complex in Vietnam and Thailand were studied by Nguyen et al. (2009) and Prihastuti et al. (2009); see Weir et al. (2012, this issue) for further review. Masaba & Waller (1992) noted that strains identified as C. acutatum may cause minor disease in ripening coffee berries. Kenny et al. (2006) and Nguyen et al. (2010) isolated taxa from this species complex in Papua New Guinea and Vietnam, respectively, from coffee leaves, twigs, and fruits. Notably, none of the Vietnamese isolates could infect undamaged coffee berries (Nguyen et al. 2010). One of the C. acutatum cultures studied by Nguyen et al. (BMT(HL)19) was sent to CBS, and a dried sample of this strain is designated here as the holotype of C. walleri. This study identifies it as the only coffee isolate from Asia, while six other isolates from coffee, originating in Africa and Central America, belong to three other species within the C. acutatum species complex (C. fioriniae, C. acutatum s. str., and C. costaricense). Two of these strains were included in the study by Waller et al. (1993).
Colletotrichum walleri is distinguishable from other species by almost all genes. It can be most easily identified using HIS3 and ITS sequences, while sequences of other genes differ by only one base pair from those of other species. The CHS-1 sequence matches that of C. sloanei. The closest TUB2 blastn match for CBS 125472 (with 99% identity, 5 bp differences) was GU246633 from isolate R14 from Capsicum annuum in South Korea (Sang et al. 2011). The closest GAPDH match for a sequence covering approximately the full gene length (with 98% identity, 4 bp differences) was HQ846724 from isolate OBP6 from an unnamed plant, likely from India (Chowdappa P, Chethana CS, Madhura S, unpubl. data). The only 100% match with the ITS sequence was FJ968601, the sequence of the same isolate previously sequenced by Nguyen et al. (2009).
Conidia are formed directly from the germ tube of a germinating primary conidium, and these are smaller and more irregular in form than those from which they are derived (Buddie et al. 1999). Additionally, older strains, especially if they have been frequently subcultured, may exhibit more variable conidia in appearance than those derived from recent stock. Nirenberg et al. (2002) observed that shapes differed among conidia formed in acervuli and in the aerial mycelium. The variation in conidial shape has led to species within the C. acutatum complex being incorrectly placed into synonymy with other Colletotrichum species, primarily C. gloeosporioides—this is a legacy of the revision of the genus by von Arx (1957). His work marked a new era in the understanding of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue), but many of the synonymies proposed were inaccurate.
In this study, we found many species that had been considered synonyms of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957) actually belong to the C. acutatum species complex, including C. mahoniae, C. godetiae, Gm. phormii, Gm. lycopersici, and Gm. limetticola. Glomerella miyabeana, treated here as a synonym of the older C. salicis, was regarded as a forma specialis of Ga. cingulata by von Arx (1957). Species treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957) have also been found in the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012, this issue). In this study, 39 strains previously identified as C. gloeosporioides or Ga. cingulata based on morphology actually belong to 14 species in or closely related to the C. acutatum species complex, including C. acutatum, C. australe, C. cosmi, C. costaricense, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. limetticola, C. lupini, C. melonis, C. nymphaeae, C. phormii, C. rhombiforme, C. salicis, and C. orchidophilum.
Not all species of Colletotrichum with acute-ended conidia belong to the C. acutatum complex. There are species with falcate conidia that belong to the C. graminicola species complex (Crouch et al. 2009). Also outside the C. acutatum complex are species from herbaceous hosts with more or less curved conidia, which were previously regarded as C. dematium (Damm et al. 2009). Additionally, the newly described C. pseudoacutatum forms straight conidia with acute ends but appears not to belong to the C. acutatum species complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). Thus, conidial shape is not a uniform feature of the C. acutatum species complex.
Considering the frequency with which strains from the C. acutatum species complex are encountered and their pathogenicity to a wide range of crop plants, it would be surprising if earlier names for C. acutatum did not exist. Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.
The TUB2 DNA sequences were recognized as comprising one or more separate species. The authors listed previously described groups that corresponded to their own classifications, including the seven groups recognized by Lardner et al. (1999): A, B, C, D, E, Ga. miyabeana, and C. acutatum f. pineum. The groups established by Lardner et al. were primarily distinguished by morphology, partial LSU sequences, and RAPD banding patterns. Some of the strains from Lardner et al. (1999) are included in this study, and we found that only some corresponded with the groups adopted by Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas (2005). Colletotrichum acutatum group A from Lardner et al. (1999) was regarded as corresponding to group A5; however, in our study, three of the four included strains of C. acutatum group A—ICMP 1701, ICMP 12923, and ICMP 17991—belonged to C. fioriniae (group A3), while only one, ICMP 17992, belonged to C. acutatum (group A5). Additionally, the three strains of C. acutatum group C, which were supposed to correspond to Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas group A3, were shown to belong to C. johnstonii (ICMP 12926 and IMI 357027) and C. pyricola (ICMP 12924). Colletotrichum acutatum group B was listed as corresponding to group A4, but the only strain included here, ICMP 12921, is now the ex-type of C. acerbum. The ICMP strains regarded as Ga. miyabeana (ICMP 12954–12957) were confirmed here as C. salicis (equivalent to Ga. miyabeana). Our phylogenetic tree (see Fig. 1) attempts to illustrate the groupings from some of these earlier studies, mapped onto our own phylogeny. This illustrates the challenges encountered when comparing groups established by different studies using varied criteria for characterization.
Differences in pathogenicity among strains from different hosts have been observed in several studies. Some fruit diseases caused by the C. acutatum complex have been shown to arise from distinct phylogenetic lineages (Peres et al. 2008), with strawberry fruit rot, in particular, rarely attributed to isolates from heterogeneous hosts (Mackenzie et al. 2009). Cross-infection potential was tested in various studies, including those by Bernstein et al. (1995), Freeman and Shabi (1996), Freeman et al. (2001b), and Mackenzie et al. (2007). Cross-infection may occur both in the field and in laboratory settings (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003). Freeman et al. (2001a) found that C. acutatum from strawberry could cause lesions on various fruits, whether they were wounded or intact. In vitro infection studies by Whitelaw-Weckert et al. (2007) revealed low host specificity among isolates that can be assigned to C. acutatum, C. simmondsii, and C. fioriniae.
The perceived lack of host specificity in the C. acutatum complex likely has multiple causes, but a significant issue stems from inadequate identification practices in pathology studies. Many investigations still avoid including sequence-based evidence or rely solely on ITS sequences, with only a few depositing adequate voucher material. This leads to less rigorous name usage than is necessary, resulting in misleading outcomes and poor comparability between studies. It must be acknowledged that many, if not most, of the species recognized through multigene analyses do not seem to be restricted to particular plants.
One factor complicating the interpretation of pathogenicity data may be incomplete or misleading information regarding the pathology of the strains studied. The stated plant/fungus association does not necessarily indicate a pathogenic relationship; strains could be isolated as benign endophytes or secondary pathogens. Further research is needed on the mechanisms of pathogenicity and population-level evolution, but it appears that many Colletotrichum species are unusually successful in overcoming multiple host barriers.
There is limited evidence of a restricted geographical range for some of the species we accept here. For most species, the number of available strains is too small to draw definitive conclusions. For example, except for C. lupini, all isolates of clade 1 (some of which are not recognized as separate species) appear to originate from Central and South America and the southern USA. The globalization of agriculture has likely led to frequent, unrecognized introductions to new regions. The baseline information we have on native versus exotic taxa is inadequate for mapping these introductions. However, some of the apparently specific host-fungus connections could be further supported by tracing more strains from their respective hosts in future BLASTN searches, such as for C. scovillei and C. limetticola.
Colletotrichum acutatum has been regarded as a pathogen of countless host plant species and is thought to occur everywhere. Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) discovered that C. acutatum group A5, accepted here as C. acutatum s. str., occurs only on certain hosts, primarily in the southern hemisphere. This study confirms that C. acutatum s. str. does indeed have multiple hosts, but the known host spectrum is much smaller than previously accepted.
Some host plants appear to be particularly susceptible to infection by multiple Colletotrichum taxa. The occurrence of species on strawberry has been well researched due to the former status of C. acutatum as a regulated quarantine pathogen. We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.
Other hosts attacked by more than one species of the C. acutatum species complex include apple, citrus, olive, cranberry, and blueberry. For example, the causal organisms of bitter rot of apple in Korea belong to C. acutatum clades 2 (C. nymphaeae and related species) and 3 (C. fioriniae) (Lee et al. 2007). In our study, strains from Malus belong to five species: C. acerbum (one strain), C. fioriniae (13 strains), C. godetiae (two strains), C. nymphaeae (one strain), and C. salicis (two strains). Talhinhas et al. (2005) identified five groups, now recognized as species, within C. acutatum s. lat. occurring on olives in Portugal: A2 (now C. nymphaeae), A3 (C. fioriniae), A4 (C. godetiae), A5 (C. acutatum), and A6 (C. rhombiforme).
The C. acutatum species complex has undergone speciation more prolifically than previously suspected, indicating that it is likely still evolving rapidly. The emergence of new species is likely encouraged by modern global agricultural practices, which facilitate the mixing of gene pools, combined with imperfect phytosanitary regulations.
