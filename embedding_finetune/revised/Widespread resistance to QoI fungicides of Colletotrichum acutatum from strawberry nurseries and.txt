Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a significant disease affecting strawberry production. Surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected from affected areas, specifically strawberry nurseries and production fields in six states across the United States. The use of fungicides, particularly quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been widely employed for controlling C. acutatum for the past 20 years. Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group. This situation necessitates immediate changes in anthracnose management strategies to incorporate other chemical and non-chemical approaches, aiming to limit the selection of resistant populations and prevent future outbreaks.
Strawberry anthracnose, primarily caused by C. nymphaeae within the C. acutatum complex, is a leading disease limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012; Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al. 2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acutatum infections include flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b; Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Infected flowers may display brown lesions on the petals, while infected fruits typically present dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on their surface, rendering them undesirable for consumption (Peres et al. 2005). During severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur in nurseries, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit production (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).
While C. acutatum infections are frequently observed in strawberry production fields, it has been suggested that quiescently infected transplants from nurseries serve as the primary inoculum source for field infections (Howard et al. 1992; Peres et al. 2005). In Florida, strawberries are treated as annual crops and are cultivated throughout the winter. However, during the hot summer months, extreme temperatures negatively impact the survival of C. acutatum in soil and plant debris (Ureña-Padilla et al. 2001).
Strawberry transplants are primarily produced in nurseries located in northern latitudes, such as Canada, or at higher altitudes in North Carolina and California (Brown 2003). While low temperatures may limit disease development, they do not completely eliminate the pathogen from strawberry transplants.

Control of Colletotrichum acutatum is highly dependent on frequent applications of both multi-site and single-site fungicides (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). Multi-site fungicides, such as captan, provide satisfactory control of C. acutatum, but they lack a curative effect, necessitating weekly applications throughout the season (Mertely et al. 2017b). Single-site fungicides, particularly the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), exhibit a post-infection effect on anthracnose; however, growers are limited in the number of applications permitted during the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Given the limited QoI applications allowed during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multi-site fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. Nevertheless, to ensure symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have frequently been used in nurseries, resulting in the selection of fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another significant strawberry pathogen (Oliveira et al. 2017).
QoI fungicides target the cytochrome b (cytb) gene, inhibiting fungal mitochondrial respiration (Bartlett et al. 2002; Sauter et al. 1999; Ypema and Gold 1999). Azoxystrobin is a QoI fungicide that has been registered for anthracnose control in strawberries for several decades (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). However, the intensive use of such fungicides has led to the emergence of C. acutatum populations resistant to QoIs (Forcelini et al. 2016). Resistance to QoIs was first identified during the 2013 to 2014 strawberry production season in Florida. Resistant C. acutatum isolates exhibited either the F129L or G143A mutations in the cytb gene, which were associated with moderate and complete resistance to QoIs, respectively. During the 2015 to 2016 strawberry season, anthracnose outbreaks were reported in strawberry nurseries and production fields across the United States.
The objectives of this study were to (i) determine the sensitivity of C. acutatum isolates to azoxystrobin collected from strawberry nurseries and production fields across a wide range of geographical locations, and (ii) survey current disease management programs implemented in strawberry nurseries.
A total of 232 monoconidial isolates belonging to the C. acutatum species complex were isolated from anthracnose-affected strawberry organs for this study. Isolates were collected from strawberry plants in nurseries located in California and North Carolina, as well as from fruit production fields in California, Florida, Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia during the 2015 to 2016 strawberry production season. Nursery source information for isolates collected from fruit production fields was also gathered when available. The isolates were stored dry on filter paper inside a sterile envelope in an airtight container with Drierite (W.A. Hammond Drierite Company, Xenia, OH) at -20°C or in 30% sterile glycerol at -80°C.
Sensitivity to azoxystrobin was evaluated based on mycelial growth using two discriminatory doses of azoxystrobin (3 and 100 µg/ml). The commercial formulation of azoxystrobin (Abound 2.08F, 22.9% active ingredient; Syngenta Crop Protection, Greensboro, NC) was employed for the fungicide sensitivity assays. Salicylhydroxamic acid was not included in the medium, as Forcelini et al. (2016) reported that C. acutatum isolates from strawberries do not utilize an alternative respiration pathway.
Among the 232 Colletotrichum acutatum isolates evaluated, 83 (36%) were found to be resistant to azoxystrobin. All resistant isolates exhibited complete resistance, meaning that mycelial growth was not inhibited even when exposed to 100 µg/ml of azoxystrobin. Notably, some resistant isolates originated from fruit, which differs from the initial C. acutatum QoI resistance outbreak in Florida, where most resistant isolates were collected from root and crown tissue (Forcelini et al. 2016).
Isolates resistant to QoIs were identified in all six states surveyed. California nurseries and production fields accounted for the majority of C. acutatum isolates (91) collected during the 2015 to 2016 season. Of these 91 isolates, 16 were resistant to azoxystrobin. Additionally, 40 out of 52 isolates collected from fruit in Louisiana were QoI resistant. Among these, 36 resistant isolates originated from a California nursery, while four came from a nursery in Canada. In Georgia, 23 isolates were collected, of which 13 were considered resistant. In Virginia, five out of 43 isolates were azoxystrobin resistant. North Carolina contributed 14 isolates, with five classified as resistant. At the University of Florida Gulf Coast Research and Education Center research field, five isolates were collected, four of which were resistant.
Surveys conducted from 2015 to 2017 aimed to elucidate the disease management programs in 10 strawberry nurseries across the United States and Canada. Nurserymen were asked to complete a brief questionnaire regarding fungicide use during the plant propagation season. The data collected was analyzed and categorized by nursery location (state or country), Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) group, and the number of applications per season. Since the focus of this study was solely on C. acutatum sensitivity to QoIs, we specifically examined the number of applications of products containing QoIs as the primary active ingredient or as part of a premixture.
Most nurseries surveyed adhered to product label recommendations, making five or fewer applications of QoI fungicides, including azoxystrobin and pyraclostrobin, or mixtures containing QoIs. However, one nursery in California, one in North Carolina, and another in Canada reported spraying QoI fungicides 10, 8, and 6 times, respectively, during one season. These applications involved alternating among azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and a pyraclostrobin + boscalid premix. The collected isolate information (nursery of origin), the number of QoI sprays during the nursery phase, and the number of resistant isolates may be correlated. The majority of plants harboring QoI-resistant isolates originated from nurseries that exceeded recommended spray programs, suggesting a potential link between nursery spray practices and the frequency of resistance.
N/A indicates no isolate available from the respective nursery source. Nursery sources were considered independently of the states from which Colletotrichum acutatum isolates were collected.
C. acutatum resistance to QoI fungicides has become a widespread problem in American and Canadian strawberry nurseries and fruit production fields. This study presents an ongoing program that monitors the sensitivity of C. acutatum from strawberry nurseries and production fields across the United States to azoxystrobin. As reported in Florida (Forcelini et al. 2016), the lack of effective anthracnose control and significant yield losses throughout the United States during the 2015 to 2016 season could be linked to the emergence of C. acutatum QoI-resistant populations.
Nursery surveys confirmed the intensive use of QoI fungicides. Single-site fungicides, such as QoIs, have frequently been used in nurseries to control anthracnose and other diseases, ensuring the delivery of symptom-free stock material. Along with commercial products containing only azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin, premixes with QoI fungicides were also utilized. This has led to an increased selection rate for QoI-resistant populations as early as the nursery phase. Since transplants produced in large nurseries are sold to smaller ones, plants may be exposed to multiple QoI applications throughout each propagation phase. Consequently, during the fruit production phase, growers face challenges in controlling anthracnose outbreaks with limited effective chemical options.
There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.
Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.
