The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software implements various analytical methods and tools for phylogenomics and phylomedicine. We report a transformation of MEGA to enable cross-platform use on Microsoft Windows and Linux operating systems. MEGA X does not require virtualization or emulation software and provides a uniform user experience across platforms. Additionally, MEGA X has been upgraded to utilize multiple computing cores for many molecular evolutionary analyses. MEGA X is available in two interfaces (graphical and command line) and can be downloaded free of charge from www.megasoftware.net.
Key words: software, evolution, Linux.
Over the past decade, genome sequencing has become an efficient and potent means to investigate a broad array of biological systems, from large-scale studies of biological diversity to tracking the evolution and origin of pathogenic microbes. The numerous steps required to glean interpretable and actionable results from raw sequence data invariably require comparative analysis of molecular sequences to discover functional and adaptive genome differences. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software provides tools to conduct such analyses. MEGA includes a large repertoire of programs for assembling sequence alignments, inferring evolutionary trees, estimating genetic distances and diversities, inferring ancestral sequences, computing timetrees, and testing selection. Over the last 25 years, MEGA's use in evolutionary analysis has been cited in over one hundred thousand studies in diverse biological fields.
The transformation of MEGA into a cross-platform version that runs natively on Linux and Microsoft Windows eliminates the Windows-only limitation, which has become particularly acute due to the increasing use of Linux in biological research. This advancement paves the way for the development of a MEGA X version for macOS in the near future.
MEGA was first developed for MS-DOS in the early 1990s, with tools like Alignment Explorer, Sequence Data Explorer, and Tree (Kumar et al. 1994). It was later upgraded for use in MS Windows. The internal control code across Windows versions, from MEGA 1 to MEGA 6, was adapted for the MS Windows system application programming interface (API), with advancements made for cross-platform compatibility in MEGA-CC and MEGA-MD (Kumar et al. 2001, 2016). Some MEGA releases have been packaged for Linux systems using the WINE compatibility layer for POSIX-compliant operating systems and the Wineskin tool (built on WINE) for macOS systems. These versions have been downloaded over 200,000 times. However, the ad hoc Windows emulation solution is sluggish and relatively unstable compared to the native application.

FIG. 1. The MEGA X main form has a modernized look and feel while maintaining the familiar structure of previous versions of MEGA. (A) The top toolbar organizes the numerous analyses available in MEGA X into logical groups accessed via drop-down menus. (B) The bottom toolbar provides access to utility functions, including the help system, example input data files, and application preferences. (C) Icons on the main form offer convenient access to input data and results explorer windows. MEGA X can now be used in two modes: one for data analysis (ANALYZE mode) and another for prototyping (PROTOTYPE mode).
With the Chromium Embedded Framework (CEF), based on the Google Chromium web browser core, we have implemented GUI elements using HTML and JavaScript in the MEGA X desktop GUI (FIG. 2). As a result, MEGA X presents a consistent look and feel across Windows and Linux platforms. We are currently developing MEGA X for macOS, which will feature the same user interface.
We have also enhanced MEGA’s computational core by increasing the number of methods that can utilize multiple processors and cores on the same machine. This improvement will significantly reduce the runtime for computationally demanding inferences. Users can specify the maximum number of cores to deploy in the Analysis Preferences dialog box (FIG. 2G). By default, MEGA X uses all available cores, minus one, ensuring that no more than 80% of RAM is consumed. Computational methods benefiting from calculation parallelization include those for selecting the best model for nucleotide or amino acid substitutions and bootstrap tests of molecular phylogenies employed with distance-based and parsimony-based methods. Users can already utilize multiple cores during the heuristic search for the Maximum Likelihood (ML) tree in MEGA.
On Microsoft Windows, MEGA X is intended for use on 64-bit systems running version 10 or later, although it will also function smoothly on previous versions of 64-bit Windows.

MEGAX now generates a configuration file that specifies analysis options for user-desired analyses in MEGACC, which many researchers utilize for high-throughput and iterative analysis across Windows, Linux, and macOS environments (Kumar et al. 2012). The "Save Settings" button provides this functionality (see Fig. 2H). Furthermore, MEGAX can now be used in prototype mode (see Fig. 1, lower right corner), if desired. This eliminates the need to distribute and maintain a separate application for generating the configuration file needed for running MEGA CC, so MEGA-Proto is no longer required or supported.
In conclusion, the cross-platform MEGAX will benefit many existing users and encourage others to consider using MEGAX in their research and teaching endeavors. The consistency of user experience across platforms should be particularly useful in facilitating collaborative analyses within and among research groups, as well as in teaching diverse groups of students. In the near future, we aim to complete the development of a macOS version to make MEGAX available on all major operating systems.
We thank our laboratory members and many beta testers for providing invaluable feedback and bug reports. This work was supported in part by research grants from the National Institutes of Health (R01GM126567-01) and the National Science Foundation (ABI 1661218) to S.K., as well as by Japan Society for the Promotion of Science (JSPS) grants-in-aid for scientific research (DB5) to K.T.
The redesigned GUI elements in MEGAX include several explorer windows: (A) the Sequence Data Explorer, (B) the Timetree Wizard, and (C) the Tree Explorer, all of which use the native widget set of the target operating system. Options dialogs (D) and the Caption Expert (E) were developed using HTML and JavaScript, displayed through MEGA's integrated web browser built on the Chromium Embedded Framework. The redesigned Analysis Preferences dialog box (F) allows users to select options for data analysis, including (G) the number of threads to employ and (H) a "Save Settings" button for generating a .mao file for use with MEGA-CC for high-throughput analysis.
