The identification of Colletotrichum species has long been challenging due to limited morphological characteristics. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have also proven unsuccessful in clearly delineating species, partly due to the high number of erroneous names in GenBank. This paper reviews the taxonomic problems associated with Colletotrichum and the difficulties in identifying taxa at the species level. We advocate for epitypification and the use of multi-locus phylogenetic methods to better delimit species and understand the genus.
We explore the various lifestyles of Colletotrichum species, which can be epiphytes, endophytes, saprobes, or pathogens. In many cases, it remains unclear whether taxa isolated from these different life modes represent the same species or different morphologically similar species. Most identifications have relied on morphology, which may not be accurate. We discuss three selected species—C. dematium, C. destructivum, and C. fragariae—to illustrate the challenges of species identification and the issues that arise when incorrect names are applied.
Additionally, we review the clinical aspects of the genus and the use of Colletotrichum species in biotransformations. We emphasize the importance of accurate identification, achievable through comparisons with type specimens and molecular data. We propose the need for consensus on protocols for the description and naming of Colletotrichum species and make predictions for developments in the next five years. This review highlights the critical need for correct strain identification prior to commencing scholarly research.
The name Colletotrichum was first introduced by Tode (1790) under the genus Vermicularia. The genus Colletotrichum itself was established by Corda (1831) and is now recognized as comprising “coelomycetes” with a Glomerella teleomorph stage (Sutton, 1992; Shenoy et al., 2007a; Hyde et al., 2009). This genus includes species with endophytic, epiphytic, saprobic, and phytopathogenic lifestyles (Kumar and Hyde, 2004; Photita et al., 2001a,b).
Puccinia and Verticillium are notable phytopathogens, while Colletotrichum is only surpassed by Fusarium, Phytophthora, and Rhizoctonia in phytopathogenic publications. The objectives of this paper on Colletotrichum are to: 1) review the problems in taxonomy and difficulties of identifying taxa to species, 2) explore the relationships and lifestyles of these organisms, 3) discuss clinical aspects, and 4) examine industrial uses (e.g., biotransformations). In all cases, we address the potential issues related to misidentification of taxa. Extensive research by numerous scholars has been conducted on Colletotrichum dematium, C. destructivum, and C. fragariae, and these data are reviewed. The reviews highlight the importance of correctly identifying strains before commencing scholarly research.
Identification within the genus Colletotrichum is complicated, as species exhibit few distinguishing morphological characters, and teleomorphic stages are rarely formed (Hyde et al., 2009). Some taxa have uncertain or extensive host relationships and pathological variations, and they are often morphologically variable in culture (Simmonds, 1965; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008). TeBeest et al. (1997) concluded that taxonomic uncertainty complicates accurate identification, hindering efforts to understand host relationships, diagnose diseases, develop effective control strategies, and establish cost-effective quarantine programs.
Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characteristics. Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always sufficient for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species due to variations in morphology and phenotype influenced by environmental factors.
To address the inadequacies of traditional identification methods, molecular techniques have been employed to characterize and identify taxa within Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Abang et al., 2002; Moriwaki et al., 2002; Peres et al., 2002; Guerber et al., 2003; Photita et al., 2005; Du et al., 2005; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Whitelaw-Weckert et al., 2007; Peres et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a-c). Cannon et al. (2000) noted that nucleic acid analyses provide a reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. The combined use of molecular diagnostic tools alongside traditional morphological techniques is currently an effective approach for studying Colletotrichum species complexes (Cannon et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2009).
Photita et al. (2005) classified 34 isolates of Colletotrichum, collected from seven hosts in Thailand, into five morpho-groups.
One of the problems with accurately identifying Colletotrichum species using multigene analysis or barcoding is that many existing sequences in GenBank are incorrectly named. Crouch et al. (2009) revealed a high frequency of misidentification (86%) based on rDNA-ITS sequence similarity comparisons in GenBank within the C. graminicola species complex. Cai et al. (2009) analyzed 343 rDNA-ITS sequences of C. gloeosporioides in GenBank (accessed September 6, 2009) and found that an astounding 86% of these sequences showed considerable evolutionary divergence from the epitype of C. gloeosporioides, most likely representing other species. These error rates are remarkably high and indicate that accurate identification of Colletotrichum species using rDNA-ITS sequence data currently available in GenBank is impossible.
How can this situation be rectified? Isolates that represent the type species are needed. Published new species must have ex-type living strains deposited in easily accessible culture collections for future research. In some cases, such as C. boninense and C. kahawae, living types are available; however, in most cases, they are not. Epitypification is necessary in certain situations, such as when the type specimen of the taxon no longer exists, is in poor condition, is of ambiguous status, or has deteriorated so that many important features are not available for further studies (Shenoy et al., 2007; Cannon et al., 2008; Hyde and Zhang, 2008; Than et al., 2008). Epitypification can resolve many taxonomic problems and stabilize the understanding of species, genera, families, or orders (Phillips et al., 2007; Shenoy et al., 2007; Than et al., 2008; Cannon et al., 2008; Hyde and Zhang, 2008). The epitypification of Colletotrichum species began in 2007, and currently, 42 species have been epitypified or have living cultures (Hyde et al., 2009).
Colletotrichum species have been reported as endophytes, epiphytes, saprobes, plant pathogens, and even human pathogens (Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Cano et al., 2004; Kumar and Hyde, 2004; Photita et al., 2004, 2005; Promputtha et al., 2007). Species that cause serious plant diseases are often isolated as endophytes from healthy plants and have also been identified as saprobes on dead plant material (Photita et al., 2001; Kumar and Hyde, 2004; Liu et al., 2007; Promputtha et al., 2007; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009). In many cases, the same species have been recorded with several lifestyles; however, due to the ambiguity of species identification, it is not always clear whether they are definitively the same species. The question of how and if taxa change their lifestyles from non-pathogenic to pathogenic still needs to be addressed and remains an important unresolved issue in the study of Colletotrichum.
Comprehensive descriptions of the lifestyles of each Colletotrichum species, linked with molecular data for accurate taxon identification, are essential for exploring, understanding, and developing effective control strategies within the genus. In one study, Prihastuti et al. (2009) described C. fructicola and C. siamense from coffee berries, isolated as epiphytes, endophytes, and pathogens, and these species have since been shown to be widespread across several hosts (Yang et al., 2009). Colletotrichum dematium also occurs as an endophyte, pathogen, and saprobe (Damm et al., 2009). The significance of these findings is substantial, as evidence continues to grow that these Colletotrichum species are ubiquitous and widespread, particularly as plant pathogens and agents of post-harvest disease.
Crouch and Beirn (2009) review the graminicolous species of Colletotrichum in this issue, while Hyde et al. (2009) discuss diseases caused by Colletotrichum species that are currently recognized. These diseases typically manifest in two forms: spots on leaves and the blackening of fruits, often occurring post-harvest. In the case of persimmons, Colletotrichum horii can infect fruits and twigs, leading to dieback and potentially the death of the tree (Zhang, 2008). Additionally, Colletotrichum acutatum, C. capsici, and C. gloeosporioides have been reported to cause anthracnose disease on chili fruits in Thailand (Than et al., 2008b). However, caution is necessary when using these species names, as C. acutatum sensu lato includes three recently described species (Shivas and Tan, 2009); C. capsici is now recognized as C. dematium, and the C. gloeosporioides associated with chili is either C. asianum or C. fructicola (Damm et al., 2009; Cai, personal communication).
Accurate identification of these species is crucial for phytopathology, plant breeding, and biosecurity, yet it has been challenging due to the lack of taxonomically informative characteristics. Much literature exists on Colletotrichum as plant pathogens, albeit often in a broad sense (e.g., Sutton, 1980, 1992), and interested readers should refer to these texts for further information. Three examples will also be discussed later in the paper.
Colletotrichum species have been identified as symptomless inhabitants (endophytes) in plant tissues (Liu et al., 2007; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009). For instance, putative C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum strains were isolated from healthy leaves and pseudostems of banana (Musa acuminata), ginger (Alpinia malaccensis), Eupatorium thymifolia, and wild ginger (Amomum siamense) in Thailand, with low frequency isolation from the rhizomes of wild ginger (Bussaban et al., 2001; Photita et al., 2005). Lu et al. (2004) isolated C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense as endophytes from leaves of 12 different tree species in the Iwokrama Forest Reserve, Guyana.
Hyde and Soytong (2008) explored the role of endophytes that may become primary saprobic decomposers or latent pathogens, leading to disease under specific conditions. Simmonds (1941) demonstrated through field experiments that Gloeosporium musarum (now C. musae) can remain latent within the skin of green banana fruits for almost five months, later developing anthracnose fruit rot as the fruit ripens. The fungus’s development during the latent phase is limited by its poor ability to secrete macerating enzymes and pectinase (Simmonds, 1963). Quiescent infections of strawberry transplants by C. gloeosporioides are common and serve as significant inoculum sources for anthracnose crown rot (Raman and Louws, 2008).
Wright (1998) studied Colletotrichum infections in citrus and isolated Colletotrichum as endophytes from growing stems throughout an entire season. She consistently isolated C. gloeosporioides, which appeared to colonize new stem tissues and eventually infect flowers at fruit set (Wright et al., 1996, 1997; Wright, 1998). Pathogenicity testing revealed that endophytic strains of C. gloeosporioides caused diseases in oranges. Wright (1998) speculated that these endophytes infiltrate the albedo of oranges and remain dormant until post-harvest storage triggers them to become active, causing stem end fruit rot (Wright et al., 1996, 1997). Although the strain was not compared with the epitype, which was unavailable at the time, it is likely to be C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto, as the epitype originates from oranges.
C. gloeosporioides isolates from strawberry can survive for up to one year in autoclaved soil, whereas viability declines rapidly within a few days in untreated soils at 22% soil moisture (field capacity) (Freeman et al., 2002). The number of conidia of C. gloeosporioides, the causal agent of water yam (Dioscorea alata) anthracnose in Guadeloupe, was higher in artificially inoculated residues on the soil surface than in residues buried at a depth of 0.1 meters, which decomposed more quickly (Ripoche et al., 2008). In Finland, C. acutatum can survive one winter in strawberry residues on the soil surface or buried in soil, as well as in infected weed debris, and can infect young strawberry plants in greenhouse tests (Parikka et al., 2006). In most of these studies, the species were identified based on morphology and were not compared with type specimens or at the molecular level, making the species names likely inaccurate. Future studies should use molecular data to compare against type specimens.
Much has been written about various individual species of Colletotrichum, yet in many cases, the name used represents a species complex, and it is unclear which actual species is involved. In the following section, we review three species of Colletotrichum to highlight the problems associated with inadequate knowledge of the species and potential incorrect or inaccurate naming.
Colletotrichum dematium was relatively poorly understood until recently and is in urgent need of epitypification. It was originally collected from the stem of Eryngium in France, as well as from solanaceous hosts (see Damm et al., 2009 for a detailed discussion). It has since been recorded from numerous hosts, including as a pathogen of chilli (Than et al., 2008). Additionally, it has been documented as a pathogen of Polygonatum falcatum (Tomioka et al., 2008) and as an endophyte of Pteromiscum sp. (Ren et al., 2008). Disease symptoms attributed to C. dematium range from fruit rot to blight affecting shoots, leaves, and flowers. For instance, Sutton (1980) noted that in herbarium collection IMI, it was represented by 216 collections from 37 countries across 118 different host genera. Many potential hosts are commercial plants, such as tomato (Bello, 2000), mulberry (Yoshida et al., 2002), soybean (Fakir, 1979; Shovan et al., 2008), and beech (Sahashi et al., 1995). Symptoms on mulberry leaves include brown necrotic spots or streaks (Yoshida and Shirata, 1998). Tomato anthracnose manifests as greyish, sunken, water-soaked lesions on tomato fruits, which later develop tan centers flecked with small black specks, with black acervuli forming in concentric rings (Bello, 2000). C. dematium has also been reported to cause post-emergence damping-off in current-year beech seedlings (Sahashi et al., 1995). The pathogenicity of C. dematium has been confirmed on mulberry, beech seedlings, and Polygonatum falcatum (Sahashi et al., 1995; Yoshida and Shirata, 1998; Yoshida et al., 2002; Tomioka et al., 2008). Studies have shown that putative strains of C. dematium are pathogenic to various hosts. Yang et al. (2009) isolated this taxon from amaryllids displaying anthracnose symptoms. However, C. dematium can be difficult to recognize based solely on morphological characteristics, as different researchers have reported varying widths of conidia (http://www.mycobank.org/BioloMICSServer.aspx?Link=T&Rec=120313).
The species C. dematium was defined based on morphological and molecular characteristics, with measurements of 15.8 × 3.2 μm and n = 50 (Fig. 1). However, as the species was not epitypified at that time, we could not confirm this identification definitively. The taxon urgently required epitypification to provide researchers with accurate reference criteria, similar to what is available for C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al., 2008). Damm et al. (2009) addressed this need by epitypifying C. dematium, noting conidial sizes ranging from 18 to 24 µm in length and 3 to 5.5 µm in width. Yang et al. (2009) demonstrated that their studied species differed from C. dematium, naming it C. spaethianum.
This situation highlights the importance of epitypification, as it stabilizes species names and facilitates comparisons across studies involving Colletotrichum species. A limited number of strains were initially included in the concept of C. dematium, and many previously reported as C. dematium sensu lato were actually found to represent other species, including C. circinans, C. dematium, C. lilii, C. lineola, C. liriopes, C. spaethianum, C. spinaciae, C. tofieldiae, C. trichellum, C. truncatum, and two unidentified species. This distinction has significant implications for phytopathology. Although only a few strains were classified as C. dematium sensu stricto, they indicate a wide host range, functioning as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Damm et al., 2009).
Colletotrichum destructivum, described by O'Gara (1915) from red clover (Fabaceae), has often been confused with several other species, including C. gloeosporioides, C. lindemuthianum, and C. truncatum. In his review of the genus, von Arx (1957) recognized C. destructivum as a distinct species, a classification that was upheld in 1970. However, Sutton (1980) did not accept C. destructivum as valid, suggesting it might be a synonym for Glomerella cingulata. Manandahar et al. (1986) provided a detailed description of G. glycines, establishing its connection to C. destructivum.
The sizes of appressoria and conidia in C. destructivum are similar to those in C. lindemuthianum, yet the two species can be differentiated based on cultural characteristics, conidia width, and their respective teleomorphs (Manandahar et al., 1986). More recently, due to the similarities in morphology of conidia and appressoria, along with the infection process and rDNA-ITS sequence data, C. higginsianum has been considered a synonym of C. destructivum (O’Connell et al., 2004).
Latunde-Dada and Lucas (2007) demonstrated that the nucleotide sequences of the D2 and ITS-2 regions of rDNA among C. truncatum, C. destructivum, and C. linicola exhibited very high similarities (97-99%). They proposed, based on a combination of phylogenetic relationships, morphology, infection processes, and intracellular infection structures, that C. destructivum is a species aggregate that includes C. linicola and C. truncatum.

An appressorium (A) produces an infection peg that invades a host epidermal cell, forming a globose infection vesicle (arrowed) and developing branched primary hyphae (PH). The scale bar represents 10 μm.
The preceding discussion highlights the ongoing confusion regarding the status of C. destructivum and closely related species, which remains unresolved. Many Colletotrichum species have been described on legumes, primarily from crops in temperate regions. Colletotrichum destructivum can cause anthracnose disease in lucerne (Boland and Brochu, 1989) and has been reported to cause significant yield losses in Europe (Pauly, 1974; Robotic and Klokocar-Smit, 1983), North America (Boland and Brochu, 1989), northern Africa (Troeung and Gosset, 1987), and South Africa (Thompson and van der Westhuizen, 1985; Koch et al., 1989). In complex infections involving C. coccodes (Wallr.) Hughes, C. dematium (Pers.) Grove, C. truncatum (Schwein.) Andrus & Moore, and C. trifolii Bain, C. destructivum is considered a secondary pathogen (Graham et al., 1976; Koch et al., 1989).
The host range of C. destructivum is broad and includes legumes such as Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus spp., Melilotus albus, Phaseolus lathyroides, Trifolium spp., Vigna unguiculata, and Coronilla varia, as well as tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum), dodder (Cuscuta spp.), and Arabidopsis thaliana (Forer et al., 1973; Massenot and Raynal, 1973; Baxter et al., 1983; Manandahar et al., 1986; Wolcan and Bello, 1988; Koch et al., 1989; Latunde-Dada et al., 1996; O’Connell et al., 2004). However, these records require confirmation through sequence data. Host specificity has also been observed among C. destructivum isolates (Wolcan and Bello, 1988).
The infection processes and intracellular structures of strains identified as C. destructivum are well understood (Figure 2d), with similar structures observed in cowpea (Bailey et al., 1990; Latunde-Dada et al., 1996), alfalfa (Latunde-Dada et al., 1997), and tobacco (Shen et al., 2001). C. truncatum, C. linicola (Latunde-Dada and Lucas, 2007), and C. higginsianum share similar infection processes and intracellular structures (O’Connell et al., 2004). Much of the existing confusion arises from the fact that C. destructivum has not been epitypified, and type specimens are unavailable for sequence data comparison. Therefore, epitypification is urgently needed to verify the species named “destructivum” against the epitype. This will also facilitate the assessment of whether the strains from cowpea used in infection process studies are correctly identified.
Acutatum (Gunnell and Gubler, 1992). Since host origin was deemed less important, von Arx (1957) placed C. fragariae in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides. However, researchers have generally retained the name C. fragariae when dealing with the pathogen on strawberries (Howard and Albregts, 1984; Mass and Howard, 1985; Sutton, 1992). Gunnell and Gubler (1992) reported that C. fragariae could be clearly distinguished from C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides by its morphology on strawberry leaf agar. Delimitation of these species remains problematic because literature references to C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides may actually refer to other species (Shivas and Tan, 2009; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1994).
Several molecular studies have attempted to resolve the relationships of C. fragariae and other species from strawberry, but to date, these studies have been inconclusive. The techniques used include analysis of zymograms (Bonde et al., 1991), mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (mtDNA RFLPs) (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1992; Freeman et al., 1993), arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions (AP-PCR) (Freeman and Rodriguez, 1995; Freeman and Katan, 1997), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Martínez-Culebra et al., 2002), and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) restriction analyses (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1992, 1994). Although molecular studies have led to the establishment of different molecular groups within Colletotrichum isolates from strawberry, the assignment of taxonomic ranks remains challenging because these techniques were developed primarily for characterization.
rDNA sequence analysis is a useful tool for species delimitation in Colletotrichum (Sherriff et al., 1994, 1995; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1994), but multigene loci analysis has proven to be more definitive. The divergences of rDNA-ITS sequences between isolates of C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides are too low to confidently separate the species (Sherriff et al., 1994; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Martínez-Culebras et al., 2003). It has been suggested that C. fragariae falls within the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996). Martínez-Culebras et al. (2000) found only a specific MvnI site among the ITS1 region of the isolates of C. gloeosporioides.
In Figures 3a and 3b, the conidia of a putative strain of Colletotrichum fragariae are illustrated, along with the crown rot symptoms on strawberry. Panel A shows cylindrical conidia, with one end rounded and the other pointed, grown on strawberry leaf agar. Panel B displays internal brown necrotic lesions of crown rot caused by C. fragariae, with a scale bar of 10 μm.
This trait was subsequently confirmed by different original sequence data and could be used to differentiate C. gloeosporioides from C. fragariae (Martínez-Culebras et al., 2003). However, it was recommended that more isolates of C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides from strawberry, as well as C. gloeosporioides from different hosts, should be studied. Recent phylogenetic research utilizing a wider range of genes has been employed to study the C. gloeosporioides aggregate from strawberry (Johnston, in litt.) and supports the findings of MacKenzie et al. (2007), indicating that C. fragariae is distinguishable from the rest of the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, but is not restricted to strawberries. A drawback of most of the above studies is that the strains used were not compared with the type species. Recently, C. gloeosporioides has been epitypified, and multigene loci have been sequenced for this epitype. It is now possible to determine whether the strains from strawberry are indeed C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, or one of the recently described species, such as C. simmondsii.
Although Colletotrichum species are primarily responsible for plant diseases, several species have been reported to cause human diseases as opportunistic pathogens. Cano et al. (2004) identified five species of clinical importance, while Damm et al. (2009) confirmed, using molecular data, that Colletotrichum truncatum was isolated from a corneal ulcer in a human eye. Colletotrichum dematium was also reported to cause eye keratitis (Giaconi et al., 2006) and fungal endophthalmitis, a potentially devastating ocular disease that can lead to poor visual outcomes (Chakrabarti et al., 2008).
Cano et al. (2004) emphasized the need for a quick and unambiguous molecular test to distinguish Colletotrichum isolates, as prompt diagnosis is essential since some drugs are ineffective against certain Colletotrichum species. For example, itraconazole was not effective in vitro against C. coccodes and C. dematium, but was active against some isolates of C. gloeosporioides. Cano et al. provided a table of morphological characters and conducted sequence analysis based on a ribosomal DNA (rDNA) dataset to differentiate their clinical strains. Their phylogenetic analysis was relatively simple, relying on very short fragments of rDNA-ITS sequence (ranging from 124-174 bp) without comparison to the ex-type strains. Although attempts were made to integrate these short sequences into the rDNA-ITS dataset of Cai et al. (2009), their phylogenetic positions could not be conclusively determined (L. Cai, pers. comm.).
Cano et al. (2004) used two strains representing two species of clinical origin and compared them against 18 non-clinical strains. Some of the strains have since been incorrectly named (e.g., C. dematium (now known as C. truncatum) CBS 351.73 has been identified as C. circinans, while C. dematium CBS 167.49 is now recognized as C. spaethianum). It remains unclear whether the other non-clinical strains were correctly named, leading to uncertainty about the proper names applied to the clinical strains. With the recent epitypification of C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. graminicola, it is now possible to verify whether these clinically significant strains were accurately named. There is an urgent need for mycologists to revisit the clinical Colletotrichum species in light of recent epitypification efforts to determine which species are involved in human diseases.
The use of Colletotrichum species in biotransformation has been reviewed by García-Pajón et al. (2003), with further publications emerging since (e.g., Bastos et al., 2007; Bajpai et al., 2009). Several species have been studied for their potential in biotransformation, with strains of C. gloeosporioides receiving the most attention (García-Pajón et al., 2003). The significance and potential applications of this genus in industrial settings have garnered increased interest over the past 15 years. Biotransformations involving Colletotrichum species have included the detoxification of phytolectins and biotransformations of saturated and unsaturated acyclic terpenoids, monoterpenoids, and related cyclic compounds, including ketones, cyclic monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and steroids.
C. truncatum (Damm et al., 2009) and the strains of C. gloeosporioides (including G. cingulata) may represent several different species within this complex (Hyde et al., 2009). It is essential to apply correct names to strains used in biotechnology, as the results of these studies may need to be verified, repeated, or compared, and patents may be forthcoming. Inaccurate naming of taxa could lead to significant problems. A review of Colletotrichum suggests that many species may have been incorrectly named in various studies related to biotransformation, clinical pathology, endophytes, molecular biology, saprobic roles, and other aspects. Correct nomenclature is crucial in future studies to ensure reliable comparisons.
Currently, it is impossible to compare species across many studies because the names assigned by one group of researchers may differ from those used by others, even when they are studying the same species. Furthermore, different species may share the same name. Additionally, the names of species with gene sequences deposited in GenBank must be verified prior to deposition to avoid mislabeling, ensuring that GenBank does not become a repository for incorrectly named gene sequences. Presently, sequence data for the rDNA-ITS region and a few other genes are available for most species with existing type specimens (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Researchers must check their sequences against these type strains to confirm the correct nomenclature.
In the future, it is hoped that an ideal gene for barcoding species in this genus will be identified. Several key papers on type specimens and cultures of species complexes have been published (Shenoy et al., 2007a,b; Cannon et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008; Crouch et al., 2009a-c; Damm et al., 2009; Shivas and Tan, 2009). These complexes can now be further studied to deepen our understanding of the genus beyond just species complexes. The question of whether these complexes can be divided into multiple species, a few species with many subspecies, varieties, or forms, or merely into subspecies, varieties, or forms remains a topic of debate, often influenced by personal preference rather than scientific evidence. It is hoped that new species introductions will adopt the "genealogical concordance method" (Taylor et al., 2000) and others (see Cai et al., 2009).
For the table mentioned, it describes selected examples of species of Colletotrichum used in biotransformations. Each entry outlines a specific biotransformation reaction, detailing the species involved (primarily C. dematium f. truncatum, also known as Glomerella cingulata) and the type of transformation performed, such as the reduction of cyclic ketones, detoxification of phytolectins, or transformations involving various terpenoids and steroid hydroxylations. The table also cites numerous studies (e.g., by Aristizábal et al., García-Pajón et al., and Bajpai et al.) that explore these reactions, emphasizing the importance of correctly identifying species to ensure accurate scientific communication and application.
Species descriptions will become standardized, and if morphological characters prove to be totally inadequate, they may be eliminated altogether. Pathogenicity testing will become essential to establish the biological role of these fungi. Colletotrichum has particular biosecurity importance, and until the genus becomes better defined, we suggest that plant quarantine authorities delay taking imprudent action. Many Colletotrichum species are proving to be widespread on a broad range of hosts, with some functioning as endophytes as well as pathogens. Many recently described species (e.g., in Prihastuti et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009) are found to be prevalent on a variety of unrelated hosts, acting as endophytes, epiphytes, pathogens, or weak and opportunistic pathogens.
Besides existing species, such as C. kahawae, which is significant for quarantine and an important pathogen of coffee in Africa causing devastating coffee berry disease, we suggest that some Colletotrichum species may prove to be cosmopolitan in distribution, and we should not be overly concerned about them. If countries wish to clarify which species they have within their borders, they need to fund research that will provide these answers. This research will be based on the collection of fresh specimens and DNA sequence data.
Although the numerous name changes within the genus Colletotrichum over the next few years may be confusing, establishing a long-term stable taxonomic framework is necessary. The examples provided illustrate many cases where we have no idea whether the correct names were used. The situation is exacerbated by the fact that approximately 86% of names on GenBank under C. gloeosporioides appear to be misidentified. It is impossible to repeat or extend scientific work and compare findings with existing published work if the names applied to species in publications are erroneous. We have no choice but to restudy, revise, and clarify the genus so that the naming of Colletotrichum species will, in the future, be reproducible and precise.
