Anthracnose is one of the major fungal diseases of strawberry occurring worldwide. In Israel, the disease is primarily caused by Colletotrichum acutatum. This pathogen leads to black spots on fruit, root necrosis, and crown rot, resulting in the mortality of transplants in the field. The host range and specificity of C. acutatum from strawberry were examined on pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, and strawberry under greenhouse conditions. The fungus was recovered from all plant species over a three-month period but caused disease symptoms only on strawberry. Epiphytic and endophytic fungal growth in different plant species was confirmed by reisolation from leaf tissues.
Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum collectively cause anthracnose on strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.), which is a major disease of this crop worldwide. Principal pathogens responsible for the disease include Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph: Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk).
C. acutatum was first observed and identified in Israel in 1995. Plants infected with C. acutatum develop bud and crown rot, leading to the collapse and death of the entire plant. In nurseries, lesions form on stolons, which may girdle the runners, causing wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants. Additionally, plants may exhibit stunting and chlorosis associated with root necrosis caused by C. acutatum.
Cross-infection potential has been reported among different species of Colletotrichum and genotypes of C. gloeosporioides on a variety of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits under artificial inoculation conditions. To determine the potential for cross-infection among Colletotrichum species, isolates from different crops were cross-inoculated on various hosts. In these experiments, isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from temperate fruits caused visually indistinguishable disease symptoms when inoculated on detached peach fruit. Similarly, in artificial inoculations of strawberry plants, C. trifolii isolates were either avirulent or moderately virulent on stolons, whereas one isolate of C. coccodes and additional isolates of C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata exhibited virulence comparable to that of C. fragariae on stolons.

Colletotrichum acutatum isolates were obtained from anemone, apple, and peach, infecting detached fruit including two cultivars of apple, avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine. These results demonstrated the cross-infection potential of two species, C. gloeosporioides (including representatives from distinct subpopulations in almond, apple, avocado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach), affecting several fruit species. C. acutatum is a known pathogen of the ornamental anemone, causing leaf curl disease. In cross-inoculation experiments involving anemone and strawberry, regardless of the isolate source (anemone or strawberry), all anemone plants died within 14 days of inoculation. Typical anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberry plants artificially inoculated with isolates from both hosts, leading to eventual mortality.
Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.
Traditional methods may not accurately differentiate between species and subspecies of Colletotrichum. Consequently, various molecular methods have been used to characterize populations. Arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR) and limited restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) have been employed to differentiate representative isolates of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum from diverse hosts, including strawberry.
Species-specific primers have primarily been designed based on differences in the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of representative Colletotrichum isolates from different species. These primers have subsequently been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides across a broad host range and to detect latent infections in plants.
In Israel, where strawberries are cultivated near crops such as tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetables, as well as various weed species, the potential for cross-inoculation is of extreme importance. An identical genotype of C. acutatum was recovered from natural field infections of both strawberry and anemone in Israel. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to assess the persistence and interactions of C. acutatum on its primary host, strawberry, and other plant species that may serve as potential inoculum sources for this pathogen under suitable conditions.
All fungi were cultured in the dark on modified Mathur’s medium (MS; 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% bactopeptone, 1% sucrose, 0.25% MgSO₄·7H₂O, 0.27% KH₂PO₄, 2% agar), supplemented for semiselective isolation of Colletotrichum, with 2.5 µg (a.i.) of iprodione (Rovral 50WP, Rhone Poulenc, France), 0.1% lactic acid, and 25 mg of ampicillin in 1 liter of sterile distilled water.
Plant and Fruit Inoculation Procedures: The plants used in this study included strawberry (cv. Malach), tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum Mill., cv. 149), eggplant (Solanum melongena L. var. esculentum Nees, cv. Classic), pepper (Capsicum annum L., cv. Maccabi), garden bean (Phaseolus vulgaris L., cv. Hilda), vetch (Vicia spp.), and horseweed (Conyza spp.). Seedlings of all the cultivated plants were received from Hishtil Nursery, Nahsholim, Israel. Plants in the inoculation experiments were grown in pots (0.5-liter volume) in peat-vermiculite medium (vol/vol; 1:1), watered twice daily by overhead or drip irrigation (depending on the experimental design), and maintained in a greenhouse at 25°C. The plants were artificially inoculated by spraying with a mixture of the C. acutatum isolates (TUT-79, -110, -137, -149, and -5954) at a concentration of 5 × 10⁶ conidia/ml until runoff, and maintained under 100% relative humidity by covering with plastic bags for 72 hours, as previously described. Leaves were sampled for assessment of survival and colonization at various time points starting immediately after spraying until the termination of the experiment. Pathogenicity assays of the Vicia (V-1, V-2, V-3, and V-4) and Conyza (CONYZA) C. acutatum isolates on strawberry and the respective weed species were performed separately for each individual isolate, as described below.
The fruits used in this study included apple (Malus domestica Borkh., cvs. Granny Smith, Golden Delicious, and Starking), pear (Pyrus communis L., cv. Spadona), peach (Prunus persica L., cv. Hermosa), and nectarine (P. persica L. Batsch var. nectarina, cv. Flamekiss), which were purchased at a local supermarket. The fruit were thoroughly washed with detergent to remove possible remnants of post-harvest applied chemicals. The strawberry fruit (cv. Tamar) were obtained from untreated greenhouse plants at the Agricultural Research Organization. The various fruits were surface sterilized by submerging in 3% sodium hypochlorite (Sigma, Rehovot, Israel) for 2 minutes, washed extensively with sterile water, dried in a laminar flow hood, and either non-wound inoculated or wound inoculated by pinpricking.
In vitro experiments were conducted to verify that surface sterilization killed all conidia and non-germinated melanized appressoria. For this purpose, conidia were germinated for 0 to 96 hours until melanized appressoria were formed on a sterile Petri dish containing a thin layer of liquid MS medium. Thereafter, the plates were surface sterilized as described, and no mycelial growth or fungal development was detected after pouring warm, solid MS medium into the plates. This experiment was repeated several times. In no case was there any recovery of the fungus, showing that surface sterilization eradicated 100% of fungal propagules (conidia, mycelium, and melanized appressoria) on the plastic as well as on leaf surfaces. Strawberry fruit were not surface sterilized before inoculation. Inoculation was performed by pipetting a 5-µl droplet of a conidial suspension (5 × 10⁶ conidia/ml) of a mixed culture of the C. acutatum isolates (TUT-79, -110, -137, -149, and -5954) from strawberry, C. gloeosporioides isolates (CG-314) from strawberry, and L-12 from Limonium spp. onto the fruit surface. Lesion development on the fruit was measured daily and compared to water-inoculated controls.
Leaves were sampled for inoculum survival and colonization at various time points: before the removal of plastic coverings from the inoculated plants (day 0 or time 0), after this removal (day 3), and approximately every 7 days thereafter. New foliage that emerged post-inoculation was also sampled as the leaves developed to evaluate inoculum dispersal. The leaves were placed into a plastic Falcon tube containing 10 ml of sterile water and mixed thoroughly for 2 minutes using a vortex mixer to remove conidia from the leaf surface. Microscopic and dilution plating experiments indicated that 80 to 95% of all applied conidia were removed from the leaf surface with this treatment after repeating the procedures at least three times over 0 to 4 days post-inoculation. Thus, the percent conidial survival was likely an underestimation of the actual survival rate. After vortexing, the leaf was removed from the tube for evaluating pathogen colonization. The tube and its contents were then centrifuged at 6,500 × g, the conidial pellet was resuspended in 1 ml of water, and conidia were quantified by dilution plating on semiselective Colletotrichum medium. The area of each sampled leaf was measured to quantify conidia per square centimeter, with survival calculated for each plant species at each time point.
After conidia were washed from the sampled leaf, it was surface sterilized by submerging it in 3% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes, washing in sterilized double-distilled water for 1 minute, and then drying it in a laminar flow hood. This treatment killed all fungal propagules (conidia, mycelium, and non-germinated melanized appressoria) present on the leaf surface, including any conidia that had not been entirely removed during the washing and vortexing procedures. The leaf was then divided into 10 parts and plated on semiselective Colletotrichum medium to determine the percent colonization.
For fungal DNA extraction, liquid cultures consisting of 100 ml of MS medium devoid of agar were inoculated in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks with five mycelial disks cut from the colony margins. The cultures were agitated for 5 to 6 days on a rotary shaker at 150 rpm and maintained at 25°C. Mycelia from the 100-ml MS liquid cultures were collected by vacuum filtration and lyophilized until dry. DNA was extracted and purified as previously described. The DNA was then dissolved in 0.5 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) to an approximate concentration of 200 to 500 µg/ml and diluted to a concentration of 10 to 100 ng/µl for PCR reactions.
Plants (strawberry, tomato, eggplant, pepper, and bean) were inoculated under greenhouse conditions as previously described. Three leaves per host plant were sampled daily, washed thoroughly in running tap water, and vortexed to remove conidia from the leaf surface. DNA extraction was conducted as described previously. Leaf tissue (1 g) was ground in 5 ml of cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer (2% CTAB, ...).
7.5 N ammonium acetate was added to the DNA pellet and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. Thereafter, the solution was centrifuged at 10,000 × g for 20 minutes, and the supernatant was collected. Isopropanol was added to the supernatant (0.6 vol/vol) and incubated on ice for 20 minutes. The solution was then centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 minutes, and the precipitated DNA was collected and dissolved in 0.5 ml of TE buffer. The TE buffer containing DNA was mixed with 2 volumes of 95% ethanol and incubated on ice for 30 minutes. The DNA was precipitated to a final concentration with 0.1 M NaCl, centrifuged at 5,000 × g for 5 minutes, dissolved in 0.5 ml of TE buffer, and used in PCR reactions for pathogen detection in planta, as described below.
PCR Amplification: For arbitrarily primed PCR (ap-PCR), primers were derived from minisatellite or repeat sequences as follows: CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG (26), GACACGACACGACAC (17), and GACAGACAGACAGACA (32). In the text, these primers have been designated as (CAG)5, (GACAC)3, and (GACA)4, respectively. PCR primers for the detection of the pathogen in planta included the ITS4 primer (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) coupled with the specific primer for C. acutatum (CaInt2) (GGGGAAGCCTCTCGCGG) (5). PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 µl, containing 10 to 100 ng of genomic DNA, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 1 µM primer. The reactions were incubated in a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA), starting with 5 minutes of denaturation at 95°C. For ap-PCR, this was followed by 30 cycles consisting of 30 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at either 60°C (for (CAG)5) or 48°C (for (GACA)4 and (GACAC)3), and 1.5 minutes at 72°C. C. acutatum-specific PCR reactions were performed under conditions for primer (CAG)5 with 0.5 µM ITS4 primer coupled with 0.5 µM primer CaInt2. Amplification products were separated in agarose gels (1.8% wt/vol; 15 × 10 cm, WXL) in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer, electrophoresed at 80 V for 2 hours, stained with ethidium bromide, and viewed under UV light for detection of amplification products.
Statistical Analyses of Data: Data from plant and fruit inoculation experiments at each sampling or inoculation period were analyzed by the least significant difference (LSD) of the means according to the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test at a significance level of P < 0.05, using the JMP software package (version 3.2.6; SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, NC).
Figure 1 shows the polymerase chain reaction amplification products using species-specific primers for Colletotrichum acutatum and microsatellite primer (GACAC)3 of genomic DNA from C. gloeosporioides from strawberry and C. acutatum isolates from various plants. Lane M displays DNA markers with sizes in kilobases.
Figure 2 illustrates the survival of Colletotrichum acutatum from strawberry on various plants (strawberry, tomato, eggplant, and pepper) in the greenhouse, under two irrigation regimes: A, overhead, and B, drip irrigation. Non-inoculated plants (C) were maintained nearby. Inoculated plants were placed 10 cm from non-inoculated ones, and conidia were washed from the leaves and quantified by dilution plating. Data from each sampling period, represented as means of six sampled leaves per plant species, were statistically analyzed, with significant differences indicated by vertical bars above each point, based on the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test at a significance level of P < 0.05.
Strawberry, eggplant, tomato, and pepper plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. acutatum derived from strawberry. Conidia were recovered from all plants over a 2- to 3-month period, regardless of whether overhead or drip irrigation was used (see Fig. 2). The number of conidia recovered from strawberry was comparable to that from the other plants at all time points and, in most cases, the differences were not significant (P < 0.05) across the different plant species, although disease symptoms were observed only on the strawberry plants. Significant numbers of conidia were still recovered from the plants at the end of the experiment, indicating that the survival potential of the fungus on all plant species exceeded 3 months.
Leaves were collected at various time points after inoculation, and conidial survival on the surface was quantified (in terms of conidia per square centimeter of leaf tissue). Under overhead irrigation, conidia survived on all inoculated plant leaves but declined approximately threefold over a 13-week period (see Fig. 2A). Similarly, with drip irrigation, conidia survived on host leaves but declined approximately twofold during the 7-week experimental period (see Fig. 2B).
Conidial survival was also monitored on newly emerging foliage sampled post-inoculation at 6 and 4 weeks for overhead and drip irrigation conditions, respectively. Low numbers of conidia (<10 conidia per cm² leaf tissue) were recovered from the new foliage of all tested plant species under both irrigation regimes throughout the experiments, which lasted 13 and 11 weeks, respectively (data not shown).
Additionally, conidial survival was assessed in non-inoculated plants located approximately 10 cm from the inoculated plants using overhead irrigation (see Fig. 2C). The number of conidia was generally low and fluctuated during the experiments, ranging between 0 and 30 conidia per cm² of leaf area for all plants; in most cases, these differences were insignificant (P < 0.05) between species. Overall, the number of conidia decreased over time, with very few remaining per square centimeter of leaf area at the end of the experiment, after 12 weeks (see Fig. 2C).
Strawberry, eggplant, tomato, and pepper plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. acutatum from strawberry and maintained under either overhead or drip irrigation. Leaves were collected at various time points post-inoculation, washed to remove conidia, surface sterilized, and plated on a semi-selective Colletotrichum medium to test for the presence of the fungus within the tissue. The fungus was detected in the leaf tissues of all plant species regardless of the irrigation regime, and in all cases, the differences in colonization among the various plants were insignificant (P < 0.05) (see Fig. 3A and B).
Under overhead irrigation, recovery of the pathogen ranged between 90% and 100% in the examined tissues over a 6-week period post-inoculation (see Fig. 3A). Although colonization declined over time, it remained above 50% in the examined tissues until the end of the experiment.
Under drip irrigation, the pathogen was isolated from all plant leaves, with percent colonization ranging from 50% to 100% during the first 5 weeks post-inoculation (see Fig. 3B).
Colonization remained between 80% and 100% in eggplant and tomato, whereas colonization of strawberry decreased to approximately 40% by the end of the experiment (Fig. 3B).
The pathogen was readily detected in artificially inoculated strawberry, tomato, eggplant, and pepper leaf tissues by PCR amplification (Fig. 4). Species-specific primer analysis was accurate in detecting C. acutatum in planta through the amplification of a specific band of 490 bp, which was observed from 24 hours post-inoculation until 7 days thereafter in the control DNA of isolate TUT-137 of C. acutatum, inoculated strawberry, and tomato (Fig. 4A), as well as eggplant and pepper (Fig. 4B). No amplification product was observed in non-inoculated control leaf tissues. Similar results were obtained in infected bean leaf tissue (data not shown).
Strawberry fruits were inoculated with isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, both from strawberry and C. gloeosporioides from Limonium spp., either through wounding or non-wounding methods. Generally, no significant differences (P < 0.05) were detected in lesion size caused by the strawberry pathogens on fruit compared to those from the C. gloeosporioides Limonium isolate L-12, 9 days after either type of inoculation (Fig. 5).
In cross-inoculation experiments involving various fruits with C. acutatum from strawberry, lesions developed over time on all inoculated, wounded fruits, whereas unwounded pear and nectarine exhibited only minor lesions (described in Table 1). Wounding of strawberry and peach did not significantly (P < 0.05) increase lesion size compared to that of pear and nectarine. No symptoms were observed on inoculated, unwounded apples.
Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.

Fig. 5. Inoculation of strawberry (cv. Tamar) fruit with isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum (c.a) from strawberry (s), and C. gloeosporioides (c.g) from strawberry (s) and Limonium spp. (l). Fruits were inoculated by pipetting 5 µl of 5 × 10^6 conidia/ml of each isolate on the surface, either without wounding or with wounding (w) by pinpricking. Data from each inoculation period (lesion size of each of 10 different fruits) were analyzed using least significant difference, with values denoted as vertical bars above each point according to the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test at a significance level of P < 0.05. Distances between symbols at each point that are larger than the vertical bar are considered significant.
In inoculations conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions, C. acutatum from strawberry was isolated from inoculated plants that did not exhibit disease symptoms but maintained virulence on strawberry. The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods. Furthermore, it has been shown that C. acutatum from strawberry can survive for nine months within plant debris in soil.
Recently, Leandro et al. reported that secondary conidia are formed on strawberry leaves in the absence of infection or host penetration. In this study, symptoms of disease were not observed on plants such as tomato, eggplant, pepper, and bean, yet conidia survived on the leaf surfaces, possibly as secondary inoculum or within cuticular and subepidermal leaf tissues. The pathogen was also capable of surviving on the foliage of plants maintained under drip irrigation conditions for at least seven weeks, indicating that low moisture conditions did not adversely affect inoculum viability, even in non-pathogenic interactions.
C. acutatum was isolated from two weeds, Conyza spp. and Vicia spp., that infested strawberry fields. The weed isolates were similar to those from strawberry, as demonstrated by PCR analysis, and caused typical anthracnose symptoms on strawberry. Thus, not only crop plants but also weeds may be colonized by C. acutatum. This aligns with the detection of C. fragariae, pathogenic to strawberry, on weeds such as chickweed, coffeeweed, sicklepod, fiddleneck, and vetch, growing in containers and around nurseries in Florida. Similarly, strawberry and anemone cultivated in close proximity in Israel were found to be infected by an identical genotype of C. acutatum.
Inoculum of Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberry is typically distributed by splash dispersal, either via overhead irrigation.
Table 1 Description: The table summarizes the lesion development on various fruits artificially inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum sourced from strawberry. It includes data for several fruit types: strawberries (both cv. Spadona), pears (cv. Hermosa), peaches (cv. Flamekiss), nectarines (cv. Flamekiss), and apples (Golden Delicious and Starking). The table provides a comparative analysis of lesion sizes across these different fruits, showcasing the varying susceptibility to the pathogen. The specific measurements for lesion development on each type of fruit highlight the differences in response to the inoculation, potentially reflecting the host-specific interactions and the aggressiveness of the fungal isolates used.
Fruits were either wounded or unwounded and inoculated with a 5-µl drop of a mixed conidial suspension of C. acutatum isolates (TUT-79, -110, -137, -149, and -5954) at a concentration of 5 × 10^6 conidia per ml. Lesions were measured 9 days following inoculation. Data are presented as means ± standard deviation. The means of each of ten lesions per fruit were analyzed using least significant difference (LSD) according to the Tukey-Kramer multiple comparison test at a significance level of P < 0.05.
In our experiments, it was shown that, under greenhouse conditions, overhead irrigation contributed to the dispersal of inoculum to non-inoculated host plants (Fig. 2C). However, conidia survived and colonized equally well on the surfaces of drip-irrigated compared with overhead-irrigated plants (Figs. 2 and 3). This may be explained by secondary sporulation contributing to conidial survival and proliferation on the leaf surface during drip irrigation, as opposed to conidial removal from the leaf surface during overhead irrigation.
Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.
