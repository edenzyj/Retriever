This study addresses the evolutionary relationships within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, emphasizing the importance of multilocus approaches. By utilizing advanced data analysis techniques and a comprehensive dataset, the research aims to clarify the complexities within this taxonomic group.
Key words: BEST (Bayesian estimate of species tree), gene-tree discordance, mating-type locus, phylogenetics.
Disentangling species complexes within the Colletotrichum genus presents a significant challenge for taxonomists. Given the global importance of this genus, primarily consisting of plant pathogens, it is critical to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to enhance biosecurity and disease control efforts. Traditional methods of species identification have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues. As stated by Sutton (1992), relying solely on morphology is insufficient for improving the systematics of species complexes like C. gloeosporioides.
The curved spore/dematium group (Damm et al., 2009) focuses on primers for the Apn2/MAT locus in a case study involving Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which is regarded as one of the most challenging species complexes to resolve. This complex includes species with the broadest host range among all Colletotrichum species (Du et al., 2005). Fungal strains from this complex have been reported from at least 1,800 plant hosts and have generated 600 base pair sequences, highlighting an expanded phylogenetic informativeness compared to other commonly used markers such as ITS, β-tub2, and GS.
Within the Apn2/MAT locus, the ApMAT marker alone was found to be almost as informative in terms of phylogenetic resolution as a concatenated dataset of seven genes. Our results further indicated that gene-tree discordance may frequently occur in resolving the complex. Many Colletotrichum strains with similar cylindrical conidia were classified as C. gloeosporioides, following the classification revision by Sutton (1992). This situation persisted until the most recent major revision of the genus (Hyde et al., 2009a). Most studies on C. gloeosporioides systematics (e.g., Abang et al., 2002; Lubbe et al., 2004; Xiao et al., 2004; Suzuki et al., 2010) primarily addressed specific hosts, often reclassifying isolates previously identified as C. gloeosporioides into other Colletotrichum species (e.g., Gunnel and Gubler, 1992; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1994; Ramos et al., 2006). The exceptionally broad host range of C. gloeosporioides complicates comprehensive studies of the entire complex.
The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.
The C. gloeosporioides complex includes phylogenetically distinct lineages derived from the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides (Prihastuti et al., 2009; Rojas et al., 2010). In this report, we present the development and application of several primer sets for the Apn2/MAT locus to enhance systematic resolution and understanding of the C. gloeosporioides complex, specifically focusing on species that inhabit Coffea spp. As demonstrated by Crouch et al. (2009a), sequence data from this locus effectively resolved the graminicolous Colletotrichum group. Rojas et al. (2010) also amplified and sequenced an orthologous region in a phylogenetic study of C. gloeosporioides s.l., further underscoring its utility. In our study, we expanded on this region for primer development and evaluated the effectiveness of this locus compared to other commonly used nuclear genes or regions, concentrating on a well-characterized group of species from coffee hosts. This included a range of divergent and well-recognized species, such as the coffee berry disease (CBD) pathogen, C. kahawae, along with other opportunistic pathogens identified by Prihastuti et al. (2009), which occur on various other hosts, as well as representatives of C. gloeosporioides s.s. We employed a recent Bayesian data analysis technique for species tree reconstruction and compared it to the conventional concatenation method (Liu, 2008).
Fungal Material and DNA Extraction: The Colletotrichum spp. isolates used in this study are detailed in Table I. Nineteen isolates were sourced from the collection maintained at CIFC/IICT (Portugal), and three from the Mae Fah Luang University collection (Thailand), representing six previously characterized species within the C. gloeosporioides complex: C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. asianum, C. siamense, and C. fructicola, including ex-type specimens for the latter three species. The C. kahawae isolates were identified through BLAST queries of the ITS and β-tubulin 2 (β-tub2) sequences against the holotype (GenBank accession numbers FJ972608 [E value = 0, Max identity = 100%] and FJ907432 [E value = 0, Max identity = 100%]) and their ability to induce CBD symptoms on detached green coffee berries. This method was found to be the most reliable for identifying true C. kahawae isolates, as recent findings indicated non-C. kahawae isolates with identical genetic sequences for several nuclear markers, including ITS and β-tub2 (data not shown). The C. gloeosporioides sampling included isolates similar to the ex-epitype strain at the ITS and β-tub2 loci (GenBank accession numbers EU371022 [E value = 0, Max identity = 98%] and FJ907445 [E value = 0, Max identity = 99%], respectively). Additionally, BLAST queries of the MAT1-2-1 HMG locus confirmed five isolates as C. fragariae in comparison with the species epitype (GenBank accession number DQ002827 [E value = 9e-87, Max identity = 94%]). Except for isolates CR21, PT111, and PR220 (both C. gloeosporioides s.s.), obtained from Citrus limon and Olea europaea (see Table I), all other isolates were sourced from Coffea spp. The isolates were revived on 1% malt extract agar with a bacterial inhibitor (KCNS, 50 mM) and incubated for 5–7 days. They were subsequently cultured in liquid media containing 3% malt extract and 0.5% peptone for 12–14 days at 25°C in the dark. DNA was extracted from freeze-dried mycelia using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Hilden, Germany), following the manufacturer's instructions.
A representative sample of 10 isolates (see Table I), comprising six species, was used to amplify and sequence the full portion of the locus. Primers were designed using PerlPrimer 1.1.18 (Marshall 2004). The first two sets of specific primers were AM-F (5'-TCATTCTACG-TATGTGCCCG-3') / AM-R (5'-CCAGAAATACACCGAA-CTTGC-3') and M5L-F (5'-ATCTTTGCGGTAGAGAAT-GAAGG-3') / M5L-R (5'-GACCCTTCTATGAACGAGCC-3'), designed within and flanking the conserved HMG domain of MAT1-2-1 (see Figure 1). The PCR amplification conditions were as follows: 3 minutes at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 45 seconds at 94°C, 45 seconds at 62°C, and 1 minute at 72°C, with a final extension of 7 minutes at 72°C. The amplification products were sequenced and used as templates, along with the C. gloeosporioides accession, for further primer design. Based on these sequences, primer pairs CM-F (5'-TCTACCTCATCGACG-CTGCT-3') / CM-R (5'-CATGTGGGCAAAGGATGGC-3') and A5L-F (5'-CAAGCGACGAAGTATACGAG-3') / A5L-R (5'-GCATCACGGGAATAACTAGG-3') were designed to amplify the remainder of the MAT1-2-1 gene and the 5' end of the Apn2 gene, respectively (see Figure 1). The PCR conditions remained identical, except that a 66°C annealing temperature was used for the CM-F/CM-R pair.
Using the sequences obtained from the 5' end of Apn2 as templates, primers AEx3-F (5'-CTCATCGGCACCTACAGC-3') / AEx3-R (5'-CAAGATGTCTCCGAGCGTC-3') and subsequently primers A3L-F (5'-TGACATGGAACGGTGAGTG-3') / A3L-R (5'-TTCCAGTCCTCGACCGTCA-3') were designed to amplify the remaining portion of the Apn2 gene (see Figure 1). The amplification reactions were performed as follows: 3 minutes at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles with 45 seconds at 94°C, a touchdown annealing step for 45 seconds starting at 62°C and decreasing by 0.5°C per cycle until stabilizing at 57°C for the remaining 20 cycles, and 1 minute at 72°C with a final extension of 7 minutes at 72°C. For all PCR reactions, a total of 50 ng of genomic DNA was used as the template in a 15 µL PCR reaction mix containing 250 µM of dNTP mix (MBI Fermentas, Vilnius, Lithuania), 0.5-0.8 pmol of each primer, 1 U of DreamTaq DNA polymerase (MBI Fermentas), and 1X PCR buffer with 2 mM MgCl2 (MBI Fermentas). The nomenclature of the developed molecular markers is as follows (from the 3' end of Apn2 onward): Apn23L, with A3L-F/A3L-R; Apn2Ex3, with AEx3-F/AEx3-R; Apn25L, with A5L-F/A5L-R; ApMAT, with AM-F/AM-R; and MAT1-2-1 and MAT5L, with CM-F/M5L-R (see Figure 2). Sequences were deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers listed in Table I.
For molecular data, using the complete taxa sampling from this study (see Table I), five nuclear genes and two intergenic regions were sequenced. From the Apn2/MAT locus (see Figure 1), the two intergenic regions (ApMAT and MAT5L) were selected, along with the MAT1-2-1 gene and the Apn25L gene fragment, considering their informative potential and sequence length. The ITS nuclear region (Brown et al. 1996) and two gene fragments from β-tub2 (O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997) and glutamine synthetase (GS) (Prihastuti et al. 2009) were also analyzed using previously described primers and PCR conditions. PCR products were verified by electrophoresis on a 1.2% w/v agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified using SureClean (Bioline, London, UK). Sequencing reactions were performed using BigDye 3.1 chemistry (Applied Biosystems, USA) on an ABI Prism 310 automated sequencer. Amplicons were sequenced in both directions, and chromatograms were manually verified for errors using Sequencher 4.0.5 (Gene Codes Corp., Ann Arbor, Michigan).
For the phylogenetic analysis, we adjusted the boundaries of the ApMAT marker sequence to separate intergenic regions from coding regions, as these are likely to evolve under different evolutionary models. Consequently, the original ApMAT sequence was composed of the 3' end of the Apn2 gene (46 bp) and the MAT1-2-1 gene (16 bp). These fragments were cut and merged with the original Apn25L and MAT1-2-1 sequences, respectively.
The phylogenetic performance of each individual marker was assessed using the online application PhyDesign (Lopez-Giraldez and Townsend, 2011), which implements an empirical metric of phylogenetic informativeness (Townsend, 2007). This tool provides a quantitative prediction of the utility and information that individual partitions contain for resolving phylogenetic questions. The required ultrametric tree was generated using the UPGMA method in the MEGA 5 program (Tamura et al., 2011). Site rates for each partition were estimated using the HyPhy script, as recommended by the author. To avoid biases from gene length and minimize phylogenetic noise, phylogenetically informative values were calculated on a per-site basis (Lopez-Giraldez and Townsend, 2011).
To create concatenated matrices from the individual datasets, we used the Concatenator 1.1.0 software (Pina-Martins and Paulo, 2008). Three molecular marker combinations were assembled for comparative purposes and designated as follows: the Apn-MAT dataset, which includes only Apn2/MAT locus markers except for MAT1-2-1; the traditional dataset, which combines ITS, β-tub2, and GS; and the total concatenated dataset. MAT1-2-1 was excluded from the Apn-MAT dataset to balance the sequence lengths of both the Apn-MAT and traditional datasets, enabling a more even comparison. Five C. fragariae isolates were used as outgroup taxa to root the phylogenetic trees (Cai et al., 2009). Additional outgroup taxa could not be included because orthologous regions for all our developed markers were unavailable in public databases, with the exception of C. graminicola, whose sequences were too divergent for accurate and reliable alignments.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed from individual and combined analyses of the seven nuclear regions using maximum likelihood (ML) and a Bayesian framework with the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Gaps were treated as missing data. The ML analysis was conducted in PAUP* 4.0d99 (Swofford, 2003) with heuristic searches comprising 100 replicates, random sequence addition, and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm. Nonparametric bootstrapping was performed with 1000 pseudoreplicates, 10 random additions, and TBR branch swapping. ModelTest 3.7 (Posada and Crandall, 1998) was utilized for model selection.
The total combined dataset was analyzed using the species-tree approach implemented in BEST (Liu 2008), incorporating the signals from each developed marker while excluding overlapping segments. The ITS, b-tub2, and GS markers generated products of the expected size. The complete set of markers was first sequenced for a representative sample of 10 isolates comprising five studied species: C. kahawae, C. gloeosporioides, C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense, along with the outgroup C. fragariae. This preliminary dataset underwent a sliding window analysis to quantify nucleotide polymorphisms across each marker's sequence and to provide a comparative exploratory analysis between markers. The commonly used ITS region exhibited the lowest overall nucleotide diversity (p = 0.0077) as it was mostly invariable. In contrast, the intron-rich b-tub2 (p = 0.0436) and GS (p = 0.0433) gene fragments displayed a greater degree of nucleotide variation but still contained regions of low polymorphism. The Apn2/MAT locus showed the greatest nucleotide diversity, with the most conserved region, Apn2Ex3, being more polymorphic (p = 0.0467) than both b-tub2 and GS. The ApMAT intergenic region had the highest nucleotide diversity (p = 0.1282), exceeding the diversity of b-tub2 and GS fragments by more than twofold. The MAT1-2-1 gene (p = 0.0512) showed considerable diversity in its introns (p = 0.1135), especially the second intron in the HMG region, in contrast with the exon sequences (p = 0.0419). In the Apn2 gene, the highest nucleotide diversity was observed in the Apn23L marker region (p = 0.0739) due to the presence of two introns, while the Apn25L region (p = 0.0559) also demonstrated significant diversity, particularly along one exon sequence.
Topology tests assessed the current taxonomic relationships of the studied species through alternative hypotheses tested against the most recent relationships proposed by Phoulivong et al. (2010). These tests utilized the topological test of Shimodaira and Hasegawa (SH) (Shimodaira and Hasegawa 1999), as implemented in PAUP* 4.0d99 (Swofford 2003). Although this current taxonomy was not formally addressed, it provided an objective starting point for analysis. The unconstrained phylogenies of each dataset revealed discordant branching orders, which were assessed for significant incongruence with the current taxonomy. Additionally, because C. siamense received only moderate support in the current taxonomy, we tested the alternative hypothesis of its monophyly relative to its closest taxa, C. asianum and C. fructicola.
A total of 22 sequences were obtained for each of the seven nuclear markers. The newly developed set of primers (ITS, b-tub2, GS, ApMAT, Apn25L, MAT1-2-1, and MAT5L) allowed the amplification of 4,061 bp, producing a total of 4,676 bp of sequence data from the Apn2/MAT locus for each studied isolate. Each primer pair generated partially overlapping fragments that, in combination, spanned all but the first 21 codons of Apn2, the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1, the complete MAT1-2-1 gene, and a small intergenic region adjacent to the 3' end of MAT1-2-1 (FIG. 1).
According to the output from the PhyDesign web application, the index of phylogenetic power per base pair varied widely among datasets, but all developed primers produced sequences with superior resolution throughout the phylogeny (FIG. 3). Consistent with previous studies on Colletotrichum, only one mating type (MAT) locus idiomorph, MAT1-2-1, was identified. Clean bands were reproducibly amplified by PCR for all isolates using all primer sets, generating amplicons of approximately 740 bp for Apn23L, 760 bp for Apn2Ex3, 840 bp for Apn25L, 910 bp for ApMAT, and 1,040 bp for MAT1-2-1 and MAT5L. All of the newly developed markers provided more informative data than traditional markers, as determined through parsimony and nucleotide diversity statistics (FIG. 3).
An overview of the Apn2/MAT locus map is provided in FIG. 3, alongside the phylogenetic informativeness profiles on a per-site basis for the seven molecular markers employed in this study (in arbitrary units). The parsimony informative percentages for the new markers were 35% for ApMAT, 19% for Apn25L, 20% for MAT5L, and 17% for MAT1-2-1. In contrast, traditional markers yielded lower values: 3% for ITS, 13% for b-tub2, and 16% for GS. Regarding the combined datasets, even when excluding MAT1-2-1 to balance the sequence lengths, the Apn-MAT dataset exhibited 478 parsimony informative characters from a total of 1,886 (25%), while traditional markers contributed only 232 informative characters from a total of 1,965 (12%).
Overall, the total concatenated dataset presented 801 parsimony informative nucleotide characters, accounting for 17% based on parsimony criteria.
We first constructed phylogenies from each of the individual markers (FIG. 4). Both maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) analyses consistently yielded identical topologies for each dataset, although not all gene trees displayed the same resolution. For instance, the ITS and MAT5L markers produced poorly resolved trees, leading to a lack of discernible topology, and therefore, were not analyzed individually (data not shown). In contrast, ApMAT demonstrated the best resolving ability, allowing for clear distinction of all species/groups and even some intragroup nodes with high support in both analyses (FIG. 4a).
Most C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates clustered with the ex-type strains of C. siamense and C. fructicola (TABLE I, FIG. 4). Generally, species/groups were reciprocally monophyletic, albeit with varying support levels. An exception was found in the GS gene tree, where two isolates from the C. siamense group formed a monophyletic group with C. fructicola. Further incongruities were identified in the analyses.
Table II presents key metrics for each dataset, including the length in base pairs (bp), the number and percentage of parsimony informative sites (PI; %PI), estimated nucleotide diversity (p), and the model of sequence evolution. This information highlights the comparative performance of the newly developed markers against traditional markers, providing insight into their utility in phylogenetic analysis.
The relationships among our species were not clearly evident based solely on the topologies of gene trees. Phylogenetic reconstructions were performed on three combined datasets to evaluate how these discordances influenced species relationships and their node support in multilocus datasets, as well as to compare the degrees of resolution. Overall, both the traditional and Apn-MAT datasets produced almost completely resolved and highly supported trees but displayed two different topologies. In one topology, C. siamense was reciprocally monophyletic with C. asianum (FIG. 5a; bootstrap: 95; PP: 1.00), while in another, it was monophyletic with C. fructicola (FIG. 5b; bootstrap: 78; PP: 1.00). When all markers were combined, the prevailing phylogenetic relationships aligned with the Apn-MAT dataset, supporting the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense and C. fructicola (FIG. 5c; bootstrap: 97; PP: 1.00). Notably, both the topology and node support for the single ApMAT marker were comparable to those of the seven-gene concatenated dataset.
To further assess the current taxonomic and evolutionary relationships among the species in the C. gloeosporioides complex, two statistical methods were employed. First, the species-tree approach using the BEST software was conducted. This method effectively accounts for discrepancies between gene trees and applies coalescent theory to combine them for inferring a species tree. The resulting tree exhibited the same topology as both the Apn-MAT and total concatenated datasets, although it provided significantly lower support for the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense and C. asianum (FIG. 6). Nevertheless, the other relationships were highly supported.
For the topological tests, we adopted the null hypothesis based on the most recently reported species relationships (Phoulivong et al. 2010), which aligned with the traditional dataset (SH test, TABLE III). With the exception of b-tub2, all individual datasets were discordant. However, only the branching order of ApMAT and MAT1-2-1 showed a significant deviation from the current taxonomic understanding (SH test, P = 0.035 and P = 0.000, respectively). Additionally, the combined Apn-MAT topology significantly differed (SH test, P = 0.000), while the deviation of the total combined dataset was only marginally significant (SH test, P = 0.076). We also evaluated whether the traditional dataset exhibited a significant deviation from an alternative scenario where the true species relationships mirrored those found in the total dataset. When the topology for this alternative scenario was constrained, it was not significantly different from the unconstrained phylogeny (SH test, P = 0.143).
Resolving species complexes in Colletotrichum, particularly the C. gloeosporioides complex, is a challenging task that requires the use of molecular systematic tools.
The Apn2/MAT locus has been explored in various studies (Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al. 2009a, Rojas et al. 2010). Our primer sets successfully generated orthologous sequences to those previously published, including the 3' end of the Apn2 gene and the intergenic region between MAT1-2-1 (Crouch et al. 2009a, Rojas et al. 2010), as well as the intron in the HMG region of the MAT1-2-1 gene (Du et al. 2005). Additionally, we obtained the complete sequence of the Apn2 gene and the entire MAT1-2-1 gene, along with a portion of the 5' intergenic region, totaling approximately 2,700 bp of novel sequence data from this locus. Our analyses demonstrated the potential of this genomic region to significantly enhance phylogenetic informativeness, addressing the taxonomic challenges of the C. gloeosporioides complex.
While our analyses primarily focused on species of the C. gloeosporioides complex that inhabit Coffea spp., this sampling strategy was beneficial given the current state of taxonomic knowledge. The six species included in our study represent relatively divergent lineages within the complex, showing 4.5% to 10.1% sequence divergence. Although this may not encompass all potential species richness in the complex, it provides a wide range of sequence diversity. This diversity is useful for assessing the robustness of the developed primers and enhances their applicability to other species within the complex.
Furthermore, unlike many undescribed or poorly understood lineages in this complex, the species we studied are well characterized and recognized through multilocus phylogenetic and morphological studies. This is crucial when evaluating the utility of newly developed molecular tools for systematic purposes. All these species have been simultaneously used in previous phylogenetic studies, establishing an objective starting point for understanding their taxonomic relationships and enabling a more meaningful comparison between traditional gene-tree concatenation methods and recent species-tree reconstruction techniques.
Regarding their informative potential, all newly developed primer pairs produced sequences that surpassed the commonly used ITS and two other gene fragments, β-tub2 and GS, which are regarded as fairly informative (Talhinhas et al. 2005, Prihastuti et al. 2009, Rojas et al. 2010). Notably, the ITS sequence, considered a promising region for fungal barcoding (Seifert 2009), performed poorly in our benchmark comparisons, failing to distinguish taxonomic groups and recover their relationships, a finding consistent with observations from other studies (Cai et al. 2009, Crouch et al. 2009b, Yang et al. 2009).
The sliding window analysis of polymorphism and parsimony statistics revealed that the intergenic region between the Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes is the most variable segment, making it a promising marker for both taxonomic and population genetic studies within the complex. Intergenic regions are generally expected to be more variable because they are not under functional constraints or direct selective pressures (O'Donnell et al. 2004, Thomson et al. 2010). However, this variability also makes them unsuitable for broad-range primer design. Fortunately, the ApMAT intergenic segment is flanked by relatively conserved regions, allowing for the design of effective primers, thus making it an ideal marker for further research.
Using markers outside the range of the C. gloeosporioides complex is likely to fail due to their highly variable nature, even in priming sites. For instance, the markers developed by Crouch et al. (2009a) to amplify partial fragments of the Apn2 gene and intergenic regions in the same locus for gramini-colous Colletotrichum species could not be utilized for the isolates analyzed in this study (data not shown). After obtaining homologous sequences from isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex, alignments revealed significant divergence between the two species groups. However, these markers are more suitable than barcode genes for accurately dissecting and unraveling the diversity and evolutionary relationships in a complex of closely related species. Moreover, as Cai et al. (2009) noted, the selection and decision regarding the most suitable barcode gene(s) can only occur during the species delimitation process, as that is when we understand which taxa need to be distinguished. Thus, we first need to fully resolve the C. gloeosporioides complex using a set of highly informative genes before adequately searching for and selecting a barcode gene.
In agreement with other studies on Colletotrichum, our findings revealed the ubiquitous presence of only one MAT gene idiomorph, MAT1-2-1 (Vaillancourt et al. 2000; Chen et al. 2002; Rodríguez-Guerra et al. 2005; García-Serrano et al. 2008). In the fungal kingdom, MAT idiomorphs code for transcription factors that regulate sexual development and recognition (Kronstad and Staben 1997). However, their configuration in Colletotrichum species appears to deviate from the majority of ascomycetes, where a single MAT locus (MAT1) exists as two alternate idiomorphs (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2) (Turgeon 1998). The exclusive presence of a MAT1-2 homolog in all species studied here supports the idea that the genetic control of sexual reproduction in this genus does not conform to any known system in the entire fungal kingdom (Rodríguez-Guerra et al. 2005; Crouch and Beirn 2009).
In our phylogenetic analyses, the individual gene trees revealed that the ApMAT marker was unique in its ability to resolve species and even intraspecific relationships. It provided essentially the same information and support as the concatenated tree of seven genes, a feat not achieved by any other single marker. The other markers exhibited variable degrees of resolution and support, ranging from low to moderate, which is typical for nuclear gene markers when addressing recently diverged taxa. However, gene trees are only singular realizations of the true species tree and may not accurately reflect the actual patterns of lineage splitting and divergence due to coalescent stochasticity (Degnan and Rosenberg 2009; Carstens and Dewey 2010). Therefore, reconstructing individual gene trees is useful for providing an overview of how each marker depicts species relationships.
This approach revealed several incongruities when comparing the topologies of each gene tree. For example, two isolates consistently shown to cluster with the C. siamense group (Mal5 and CCM5) were monophyletic with isolates from the C. fructicola group in the GS gene tree. Additionally, each analyzed locus supported a discordant species branching order, making the correct relationships among the studied Colletotrichum species unclear. Only one gene tree (b-tub2) was congruent with the current taxonomic understanding of the sampled species, while the ApMAT and MAT1-2-1 gene trees revealed significantly deviated phylogenetic signals. Even when different combinations of genes were concatenated, these discordances remained significant.
Gene-tree discordance among species of the C. gloeosporioides complex has been previously noted due to factors such as hybridization (Meng and Kubatko 2009) and incomplete lineage sorting (Degnan and Rosenberg 2009). To our knowledge, this is the first report highlighting gene-tree discordance within this group. In our study, although the total concatenated dataset produced a single resolved topology congruent with that of the combined Apn-MAT and individual ApMAT datasets, the assumptions of the concatenation method were violated due to heterogeneity between the embedded gene trees. Additionally, longer and more informative markers, like those from the Apn2/MAT locus, can bias tree topology because their phylogenetic signal may overshadow the information from less informative markers (Knowles and Carstens 2007).
Given that the evolutionary history of species is largely considered a stochastic process (Kingman 1982), we employed a recent statistical framework designed to address discrepancies in gene trees from multiple unlinked loci, specifically to estimate the species tree. The Bayesian hierarchical model implemented in the BEST program accommodates gene tree heterogeneity and extracts useful information, providing a more accurate estimate of the true species tree (Edwards et al. 2007).
The resulting species-tree topology aligned with that of the total concatenated dataset, except for the relationships among C. siamense and C. asianum. While all other nodes were highly supported, the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense and C. asianum lacked support, and their relationship with C. fructicola remained unresolved. This outcome persisted despite utilizing a large and highly informative dataset. As suggested by Degnan and Rosenberg (2009), issues related to incomplete lineage sorting are expected to intensify as the time since species divergence decreases, indicating that these species may have diverged recently, complicating their relationships.
To enhance our understanding of the processes driving speciation and the evolution of phenotypic traits, recognizing and delineating nascent evolutionary lineages will be crucial (Wiens 2007). Furthermore, it would be intriguing to evaluate the effects of using different outgroup taxa in phylogenetic inferences as our taxonomic knowledge of Colletotrichum expands and molecular methodologies improve.
Overall, this study illustrates the significant contributions that the Apn2/MAT locus can make to the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex. We report the development and application of a novel set of primers as valuable tools for generating sequence data that can clarify species and even population relationships. Based on our findings, we propose an alternative perspective on the evolutionary relationships among the studied species. Given our demonstration that gene-tree discordance can be problematic in recently diverged species, we emphasize that highly variable markers, such as the ApMAT, are better suited to resolve phylogenetic relationships. We hope this contribution will encourage further research into this complex, ultimately leading to a deeper understanding of its structure, evolution, and diversity.
