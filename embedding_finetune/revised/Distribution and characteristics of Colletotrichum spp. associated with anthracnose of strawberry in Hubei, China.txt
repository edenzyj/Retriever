Han, Y. C., Zeng, X. G., Xiang, F. Y., Ren, L., Chen, F. Y., and Gu, Y. C. 2016. Distribution and characteristics of Colletotrichum spp. associated with anthracnose of strawberry in Hubei, China. Plant Disease 100:996-1006.
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a serious disease affecting strawberries. The etiology of anthracnose in strawberries is complex, with several Colletotrichum species identified as causal agents. In this study, multilocus phylogenetic analysis (utilizing genes such as actin, β-tubulin, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) revealed that 100 isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of strawberry in central China belong to five species. Specifically, 97 isolates were identified as belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, with the distribution as follows: C. murrayae (81%), C. gloeosporioides (8%), C. fructicola (4%), and C. aenigma (4%). Additionally, three isolates from the C. acutatum complex were identified as C. nymphaeae.
On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).
Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.

Multilocus phylogenetic analyses have greatly contributed to the understanding of species complexes, particularly through the epitypification of several important pathogenic species (Cai et al. 2009; Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a; Doyle et al. 2013; Su et al. 2011; Weir et al. 2012). Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and Colletotrichum acutatum species complexes were made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). Hyde et al. (2014) reviewed species identification within the Colletotrichum genus, revealing that the C. gloeosporioides complex consists of 34 taxa, while the C. acutatum complex currently comprises at least 31 taxa (Damm et al. 2012a). Until now, little has been known about the species and distribution of Colletotrichum associated with strawberry anthracnose in China.
The first objective of this study was to identify and characterize the species associated with strawberry anthracnose in central China, utilizing morphological, molecular, and pathogenic characteristics. The second objective was to analyze the distribution of Colletotrichum species based on a large number of isolates.
Fungal Isolate Collections: Hubei Province, located in the central region of the Yangtze River, has a warm, humid, subtropical climate (Zhang et al. 2009). From 2012 to 2014, plants exhibiting stunting, chlorosis, and root necrosis were collected from nurseries and production fields in central China. Thirteen locations were sampled from different geographical regions within central China. The altitudes of the sampling locations were determined using GPS positioning with an HTC Desire 816D (HTC Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Most areas in Hubei Province are plains, with elevations of no more than 100 m. The 10-day average temperatures from 2012 to 2013 in Wuhan and Lichuan were provided by the meteorological service center of Hubei Province, China. The 10-day average temperature in Wuhan (with an elevation of less than 100 m) from July to September ranged from 20.7°C to 32.4°C in 2012 and 2013. Enshi, a mountainous area to the west of Hubei Province, had a sampling location at approximately 1,100 m elevation, where the 10-day average temperature from July to September ranged from 16.1°C to 25.2°C in 2012 and 2013.
Polymerase Chain Reaction and DNA Sequencing: Partial sequences corresponding to actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin...
Lesions were observed on strawberry petioles, stolons, and leaves. Among the collected isolates, 98 were sourced from Hubei Province, while 2 isolates (Nj-2 and Nj-122) were obtained from Jiangsu Province in October. All isolates were stored at 10°C for about 1 to 2 weeks before DNA extraction.
Extraction of Fungal DNA: To obtain mycelia from Colletotrichum spp., a 5-mm diameter plug was taken from the growing margin of a 5-day-old colony and inoculated at the center of an autoclaved cellophane membrane placed on PDA (pH 7.0) in a petri dish (90 mm in diameter) (Lou et al. 2015). The dish was incubated at 28°C for 4 days. The mycelia of each isolate were collected using an autoclaved spatula and stored at −20°C until use. The collected mycelia were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted and purified according to the methods described by Lee and Taylor (1990). DNA samples from each isolate were stored at −20°C until needed.
PCR Amplification: The PCR amplification mixtures were set up in 0.25-ml tubes containing 60 ml of reaction mixture, which included 1 ml of each primer solution (50 mM), 2 ml of dNTP mix solution (2.5 mM), 1 ml of gDNA solution (approximately 50 ng per reaction), 1 ml of Taq DNA polymerase (5 U per reaction; TAKARA Biotechnology Co., Ltd., Dalian, China), 6 ml of PCR buffer, and 49 ml of PCR-grade water. The PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (PTC-100 TMPeltier Thermal Cycler; Hercules, CA).
The cycling parameters for GPDH consisted of an initial denaturation step at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final extension at 72°C for 10 minutes. For CAL, the parameters were 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 2 minutes, concluding with a final step at 72°C for 10 minutes. The ACT, TUB2, and CHS-1 regions were amplified using a 5-minute denaturation step at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 59°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final 10-minute extension at 72°C.
A 5-ml aliquot of each PCR product was separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel in 1.0 Tris-acetate EDTA buffer and photographed under UV light after staining with Gel Red for 30 minutes. PCR products containing the target band were purified using the AxyPrep PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen Biological Technology Co., Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China) according to the manufacturer’s instructions and sequenced individually on an ABI PRISM 377-96 automatic sequencer (Beijing AuGCT Biotechnol. Co., Ltd., Beijing) using the dideoxynucleotide termination method with a Big Dye Terminator v2.0 Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Inc., Foster City, CA).
All sequences were grouped into 25 categories by genes and species based on preliminary phylogenetic analyses and were aligned using DNAMAN (v. 7.0). Sequences exhibiting single-nucleotide polymorphisms were amplified and sequenced a total of three times to confirm that these polymorphisms were not due to sequencing errors.
Molecular Identification and Phylogenetic Analyses: The partial DNA sequences of ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GPDH, and TUB2 were obtained for all isolates, except Lch-5, Lch-9-1, and Lch-13.
Table 1 Description: The table included in the document lists the primers used in the study, detailing their sequences and sources. Each primer is identified with its corresponding designation, such as T1, TUB2-R2, and CL1C, along with specific sequences and references. For instance, the sequences for Actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) are provided, alongside information about which primers were utilized for PCR product sequencing.
A four-locus combined dataset (ACT + CHS-1 + GPDH + TUB2) was established for the second Bayesian inference analysis, using Colletotrichum pseudoacutatum as an outgroup. Multiple sequence alignments for each gene were reconstructed using ClustalW as implemented in MEGA v.5 (Tamura et al., 2011). The generated sequences were manually truncated to align with reference sequences of the type isolates for constructing phylogenetic trees. Bayesian inference was utilized to reconstruct these phylogenetic trees using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al., 2012). The best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were determined for ACT.
Table Description: The table lists strains and sequences used in the study, including columns for species, isolates, substrates, locality, and GenBank accession numbers. Each entry represents different isolates of Colletotrichum, detailing their respective identifiers and collection locations, along with the date of sample collection formatted by year and month. The species included range from C. aenigma to C. murrayae, showcasing a diverse representation of isolates and their respective sequences across various substrates.
(K80+G), CAL (GTR+G), CHS-1 (K80+G), GPDH (HKY+I), and TUB2 (GTR+I) were selected using MrModelTest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) based on the Akaike Information Criteria. The multiple nucleotide sequence alignments of all genes were concatenated, and the analysis was performed twice on the full dataset for 5 × 10^7 generations. Samples were taken from the results every 1,000 generations. The convergence of all parameters was verified using the Tracer program (Rambaut and Drummond 2007). The first 25% of generations were discarded as burn-in. The concatenated alignment and trees were submitted to TreeBASE (www.treebase.org) with a submission number of 16878.
Based on the results of phylogenetic analyses, 21 representative Colletotrichum isolates obtained from different locations were selected for further characterization of colony and mycelial growth at different temperatures. The selected isolates included five C. murrayae isolates (Yd-8, Ydu-15, Nj-2, Nj-122, and MC-17-1), four C. fructicola isolates (Sab-4-3, Sha-4, Lch-39-2, and Fch-3), five C. gloeosporioides isolates (Lch-1911, Xya-221, Yd-2, Jsh-6-1, and Wha-4), four C. aenigma isolates (Wha-2, Lbwuh-4-2, Hzau-1, and Hzau-2-1), and three C. nymphaeae isolates (Lch-5, Lch-9-1, and Lch-13).
Morphological and cultural characterizations were performed according to the methods described by Cai et al. (2009). Mycelial discs (5 mm in diameter) were taken from areas near the colony edge of 5-day-old cultures, transferred to PDA, and incubated at 28 °C under mixed white and near-UV fluorescent light sources with a cycle of 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with three replicates of each isolate. Colony color, conidial dimensions, and morphology were assessed.
Table 2 lists the details of various Colletotrichum isolates, including their GenBank accession numbers, species, specific isolates, substrate, locality of collection, and date of collection. Each entry corresponds to a particular isolate, detailing its associated species and other relevant data, which helps in understanding the diversity and geographical distribution of these isolates.
Leaf samples were collected in Enshi, Hubei, China, in July 2013 and August 2014.

Research published in Plant Disease (May 2016) cites several studies (Peng et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). Conidial suspensions for each species were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA). The morphology of the conidia was observed, and sizes were measured for 50 conidia per isolate using a microscope (BM2000; Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China).
A total of 21 isolates from five species were evaluated to determine the effect of temperature on radial colony growth. All isolates were maintained on PDA supplemented with lactic acid at 28 °C for 5 days. Plugs of agar (5 mm in diameter) were cut from the leading edge of colonies and placed in the center of petri plates containing PDA. The plates were wrapped with parafilm and placed in an incubator (BPH-9272; Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China) at one of 11 temperatures (ranging from 6 °C to 42 °C) in the dark. After 4 days, colony diameters were measured to calculate the mycelial growth rate (in millimeters per day). The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with three replicates for each temperature treatment and was repeated once.
Not all Colletotrichum isolates were able to sporulate on PDA supplemented with 0.2% yeast extract (PDAY). Therefore, one isolate from each species that could sporulate on PDAY was selected for pathogenicity assays. The isolates included C. murrayae (Nj-2), C. gloeosporioides (Jsh-7-1), C. fructicola (Lch-39-2), C. aenigma (Lbwuh-4-2), and C. nymphaeae (Lch-5). These isolates were maintained on PDA with lactic acid at 28 °C for 5 days, and then 5 mm agar plugs were placed in the center of PDAY plates. The fungal isolates were grown at 28 °C under mixed white and near-UV fluorescent light for 12 hours of light and 12 hours of darkness. They sporulated profusely after 7 to 10 days. Plates were then flooded with sterile distilled water, and the spore suspension was filtered through cheesecloth to remove dislodged mycelia (Mangandi et al. 2015). The suspension was adjusted to 2 × 10^6 conidia/ml.
A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree was constructed using 132 isolates of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, based on concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CAL, GPDH, and CHS-1 genes. The analysis utilized a separate model of DNA evolution for each gene, with values next to the nodes indicating Bayesian posterior probability based on 5,000,000 generations. C. boninense was used as an outgroup. Ex-type cultures are emphasized in bold, with their original taxonomic names noted. The scale bar indicates the number of expected changes per site.
N is the total number of leaves or petioles.
Data Analysis: Data from the pathogenicity tests were subjected to analysis of variance using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS, version 8.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) to determine the significance of treatment differences. Means for different species from the pathogenicity test were separated using the least significant difference (LSD) test at a P = 0.05 level. Minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperature data were analyzed using the general linear model procedure (PROC GLM) in SAS, with species considered fixed effects and isolates considered random effects.
In Figure 3, a Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree illustrates the relationships among 34 isolates of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex. The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, GPDH, and CHS-1 genes, each analyzed with a separate model of DNA evolution. Values next to the nodes represent Bayesian posterior probability values derived from 500,000 generations. C. pseudoacutatum was utilized as an outgroup. Ex-type cultures are highlighted in bold, including the original taxonomic names. The scale bar indicates the expected changes per site.
Molecular Identification and Phylogenetic Analyses: The ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GPDH, and TUB2 regions of all isolates were successfully amplified and sequenced. Among the 100 isolates, 97 were identified as belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, while 3 were identified as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex. Bayesian inference (A) for the haplotypes of the C. gloeosporioides species complex was performed using the combined TUB2, ACT, CAL, GPDH, and CHS-1 sequences, resulting in 2,352 aligned characters. The boundaries for the loci used in the alignment were as follows: TUB2 (1 to 733), ACT (734 to 1,028), CAL (1,029 to 1,776), GPDH (1,777 to 2,081), and CHS-1 (2,082 to 2,352). Bayesian inference (B) for the C. acutatum species complex was based on the combined TUB2, ACT, GPDH, and CHS-1 sequences, comprising 1,265 characters after alignment. The boundaries for these loci were: TUB2 (1 to 495), ACT (496 to 745), GPDH (746 to 1,015), and CHS-1 (1,016 to 1,265). The isolates from strawberries clustered into five clades, with 81 isolates grouping with C. murrayae (Li J. Peng & ...).
L. Cai and K. D. Hyde identified four isolates that clustered with C. aenigma (B. S. Weir & P. R. Johnston) (Fig. 2). In the Bayesian inference analysis, three isolates clustered with C. nymphaeae (Pass.) Aa (Fig. 3). Among the isolates, C. murrayae was the most frequently isolated species, comprising 81% of all isolates, followed by C. gloeosporioides, which accounted for 7%. Isolates of C. murrayae were widely distributed throughout Hubei Province, while C. gloeosporioides was primarily found in Wuhan, Xiangyang, Yichang, and Enshi. C. fructicola was mainly distributed in Xiangyang, Jingzhou, and Enshi, and all four isolates of C. aenigma were isolated from Wuhan. Additionally, C. nymphaeae was distributed in Enshi (Fig. 4). The altitudes of the sampling locations did not exceed 100 m, except for Enshi, which had an altitude of 1,100 m.
Morphological and Cultural Characterization: Few differences in colony morphology were observed among the five species identified when grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA). All selected isolates developed white colonies that turned gray after 10 days. Isolates of C. nymphaeae and C. gloeosporioides produced numerous conidia on PDA, while the other three species produced fewer conidia (Fig. 5). The conidia produced by C. nymphaeae were sharp at both ends (Fig. 6), which distinguished them from the other four species studied (Table 3).
Effect of Temperature on Mycelial Growth: The optimum temperature for all five Colletotrichum species in this study was 28 °C; however, their tolerance to high temperatures (34 °C) varied (Fig. 7). The five species were classified into four groups based on their maximum growth temperatures (Table 4). Isolates of C. nymphaeae, isolated only in Enshi, were sensitive to high temperatures, showing an average growth rate of 0.11 mm/day at 34 °C, with no mycelial growth observed above this temperature (Table 4). C. fructicola and C. aenigma showed similar high-temperature tolerances, growing very slowly at 36 °C, with colony diameters smaller than those of C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides but larger than those of C. nymphaeae. No mycelial growth of C. fructicola and C. aenigma was observed above 36 °C (Fig. 7). In contrast, C. gloeosporioides and C. murrayae were tolerant of high temperatures, exhibiting significantly larger colony diameters than the other species at temperatures above 36 °C. Mycelial growth was observed even at 40 °C, with average growth rates of 0.11 and 0.08 mm/day, respectively (Fig. 7).
Pathogenicity Assays: All isolates of Colletotrichum tested were pathogenic to non-wounded strawberry leaves and petioles. Symptoms first appeared on leaves, where they developed sunken, prominent dark-brown to black decay, along with necrotic lesions. Typical orange conidial masses were often observed on leaves 7 to 10 days after inoculation. Symptoms of anthracnose were not observed on petioles at 10 days after inoculation, but they appeared on both leaves and petioles by 20 days (Fig. 5). Disease severity varied significantly among the five species. Isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity on both leaves and petioles (Table 5). Plant mortalities caused by C. fructicola and C. murrayae at 30 days after inoculation were 77.8% and 55.6%, respectively (Table 5). Meanwhile, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. nymphaeae showed strong pathogenicity to leaves but weak pathogenicity to petioles, with plant mortalities of 5.6%, 16.7%, and 11.1%, respectively (Table 5), compared to 0% for the water control plants.
A study by Weir et al. (2012) and a recent investigation indicated that this species is associated with the genera Citrus, Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis (Weir et al. 2012). These findings align with earlier reports stating that the C. gloeosporioides species complex is the most prevalent agent of strawberry anthracnose in China, while the C. acutatum species complex only occasionally causes anthracnose (Xie et al. 2010). C. theobromicola (synonymous with C. fragariae) has been reported to infect strawberry plants (Brooks 1931; Xie et al. 2010), but no isolates of this species were identified in the current study.
Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes have been made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). However, the biological characteristics, such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum species, remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). High temperatures and their frequency can delay or even prevent the onset of plant diseases (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). Conversely, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature plays a vital role in disease emergence.
For instance, Botrytis fruit rot of strawberries, caused by Botrytis cinerea, primarily occurs at lower temperatures during winter and spring (Elad et al. 2007); however, Colletotrichum species typically require warmer temperatures and predominantly cause anthracnose in strawberries during the summer (Henz et al. 1992; Xie et al. 2010). The minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures are important biological traits widely used to characterize microorganisms (Damm et al. 2012a,b; Prihastuti et al. 2009; Weir et al. 2012). In this study, no significant differences were observed in the minimum and optimum growth temperatures of the five Colletotrichum species, but their maximum growth temperatures varied (as detailed in Table 4).
The five Colletotrichum species were categorized into four classes based on their maximum growth temperatures. C. murrayae, originally reported from citrus leaves in China (Peng et al. 2012), is tolerant to high temperatures and exhibits strong pathogenicity towards strawberry plants. It was the most frequently isolated species across nearly all sampling areas, suggesting it is the most economically significant species in strawberry nurseries in Hubei, China.
C. gloeosporioides also showed tolerance to high temperatures but was weakly pathogenic to strawberry plants, representing the second most prevalent species with 8% of all isolates (see Fig. 4). C. fructicola, which was first reported causing coffee berry disease in Thailand (Prihastuti et al. 2009), demonstrated stronger pathogenicity towards strawberry plants compared to the other four species in this study. However, it exhibited less tolerance to high temperatures than both C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides, occurring only sporadically.
According to current data, the results revealed that each species possesses a stable and distinguishable maximum growth temperature, which can be used to differentiate Colletotrichum species, particularly those that are morphologically similar. The frequencies and distributions of these five species relate to differences in high-temperature tolerance and pathogenicity. This research may enhance our understanding of how Colletotrichum species emerge and spread to geographical regions with varying latitudes or elevations.
Due to climate change, pathogens are increasingly exposed to warmer environments, and the impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to escalate with latitude and elevation (Colwell et al. 2008; Deutsch et al. 2008; Harvell et al. 2002). This research is also crucial for predicting changes that may occur under global warming conditions. Further studies should be conducted on the host range, distribution, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species at different temperatures.
In the figure presented, conidia of five Colletotrichum species from strawberry are displayed. Specifically, it shows conidia from: A) Colletotrichum murrayae, B) C. fructicola, C) C. gloeosporioides, D) C. aenigma, and E) C. nymphaeae. Conidial suspensions for each species were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses on potato dextrose agar.
A summary table presents morphological data of the Colletotrichum isolates, detailing conidia characteristics, including species, colony characteristics, length, width, and shape. For instance, Colletotrichum murrayae and C. fructicola both have rounded shapes, with average lengths around 14.0–14.4 mm and widths of approximately 3.8–4.8 mm. Meanwhile, C. nymphaeae is noted for having a pointed shape, with a shorter average length of about 11.2 mm and a width of 3.9 mm. This morphological data provides insight into the diversity within the Colletotrichum species.

Table 4 presents the minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures of Colletotrichum spp. The data includes five isolates of C. murrayae, five isolates of C. gloeosporioides, four isolates of C. fructicola, four isolates of C. aenigma, and three isolates of C. nymphaeae, all cultured on potato dextrose agar in the dark at varying temperatures for four days. The table shows the temperatures (°C) as follows: C. murrayae (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 38.8 b), C. gloeosporioides (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 40.0 a), C. fructicola (10.0 a, 28.4 a, 36.0 c), C. aenigma (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 36.0 c), C. nymphaeae (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 34.0 d). Means with the same letters are not significantly different (P ≤ 0.05). Table 5 outlines the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum isolates on strawberry, with data presented as mean ± standard deviation. The disease index was evaluated 20 days after inoculation, and the percentage of plant mortality was assessed 30 days post-inoculation. Mean percent mortality of strawberry due to conidial suspension of Colletotrichum spp. was measured by spray methods.
