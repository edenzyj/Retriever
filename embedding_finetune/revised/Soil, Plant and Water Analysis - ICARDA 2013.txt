The authors would like to thank all past and present ICARDA staff associated with the Soil and Plant Analysis Laboratory for their contributions to its operation and the development of various procedures. Special appreciation is extended to Dr. Abdallah Matar for introducing the idea of analysis as a foundation for crop production in the region, particularly through the Soil Test Calibration Network. The contributions of Dr. Karl Harmsen, the late Dr. Sonia Garabet (formerly of the Soil Analysis Laboratory), and the late Mr. Samir Masri (formerly of the Soil Preparation Laboratory) to the authorship of the first edition of this manual are recognized. We also appreciate Dr. Abdul Rashid from Pakistan for his valuable input regarding the two earlier editions of this manual. Furthermore, we extend our gratitude to Dr. Theib Oweis, Director of the Integrated Water and Land Management Program (IWLMP), for his encouragement and support. Dr. John Ryan has been involved throughout the entire process of soil and plant analysis, initially in Morocco as a member of the Soil Test Calibration Network and later as a Soil Fertility Specialist. He was the lead author of the first two editions of this manual and a co-author of the third edition.
Since ICARDA’s inception, the Soil-Plant Analysis Laboratory has played a vital role in the research activities of the Natural Resource Management Program (NRMP) and across the Center. ICARDA management has consistently supported the Soil-Plant Laboratory; without this support, the publication of this manual, which outlines adapted soil and plant analysis procedures, would not have been possible.

Soil is a non-renewable resource essential for human survival. Historically, the rise of great civilizations has been linked to soil quality and water availability, while the decline of such civilizations is often attributed to mismanagement of soil and land. Thus, crop productivity and soil fertility are closely intertwined.
In today’s crowded world, the challenge of feeding and clothing the growing populations in developing countries is daunting. Yields must be increased from existing land areas, and enhancing soil fertility to meet the demands of higher-yielding crops is essential. Soils vary significantly in their capacity to grow crops without fertilizer; even the richest soils experience declining yields without human intervention. Essentially, soil is not always the perfect medium for growing plants; however, it remains the only available option.
As no essential element can substitute for another, it is critically important to identify where and when such deficiencies occur. This is where the role of soil and plant analysis comes in. Techniques have been developed to evaluate soil fertility constraints based on soil chemical extraction and the analysis of the plants that grow in such soils. Both methods are complementary and, when calibrated with field crop responses to fertilizers, provide a rational basis for identifying which elements are lacking and how much fertilizer—whether organic or inorganic—should be applied. Therefore, soil and plant analysis laboratories play a vital role in the agricultural development of the WANA region. However, the process does not end there. To be meaningful and valid, tests must be appropriate for their intended purpose, as well as reliable and repeatable.
The idea for this soil, plant, and water analysis manual emerged from the Soil Test Calibration Program within the region’s national agricultural programs, which laid the groundwork for sound fertilizer recommendations. Thus, it was fitting for ICARDA to address this fundamental issue. If soil and plant tests are not reliable, the process of sampling and analysis becomes meaningless and undermines the validity of any agronomic trials. This manual serves as a cornerstone of ICARDA’s soil and water-related research program, as well as its training initiatives, acting as a vital link with agricultural scientists in ICARDA's mandate region.
This laboratory manual of analytical methods has been compiled primarily for research assistants, technicians, and student trainees working in the laboratory. The methods have been selected from various sources and adapted for routine analyses in the WANA region. Detailed descriptions of the methods can be found in the original publications listed in the references. As analytical techniques continue to develop and improve, this manual will be subject to ongoing revisions. Any helpful suggestions and feedback from users are greatly appreciated.
The idea of having a common laboratory manual for the WANA region was based on the understanding that the soils in this arid to semi-arid area share a common suite of properties, which leads to similar nutritional problems in crops. Collaborative research in the Soil Test Calibration Network in the Mediterranean zone also revealed that several soil tests for assessing nutrient availability have regional applicability (Ryan and Matar, 1990, 1992). Furthermore, there was a lack of laboratory manuals on plant analysis relevant to the crop nutritional problems in the region.
A common soil, plant, and water analysis manual is also fundamental to the success of the WANA soil fertility network. To address the existing gap, a comprehensive manual on all essential soil, plant, and water analyses was developed. This manual was intentionally designed in a “cookbook” format for the ease of laboratory technicians. Upon completion, the manual draft was reviewed and endorsed at the Soil Fertility Meeting in Tel Hadya in 1995 (Ryan, 1997).
Subsequently, the First Edition of the manual (Ryan, J., S. Garabet, K. Harmsen, and A. Rashid, “A Soil and Plant Analysis Manual Adapted for the WANA Region”) was published in 1996 by ICARDA and distributed widely among soil and plant analysis laboratories throughout the region. The response was very encouraging, with most laboratory managers appreciating the initiative, particularly for compiling all the needed methodologies in a single, easy-to-use volume for laboratory technicians.
The Third Edition of the manual reflects the changes that have occurred within the past few years in the region, particularly with respect to water and irrigation. While it continues to focus on production agriculture, it acknowledges an increasing concern about environmental pollution, mainly from nitrates, heavy metals, and toxic organic compounds. With advancements in methodologies and equipment, most soil laboratories can now address both agricultural and environmental concerns. Additionally, improvements have been made in the electronic handling of data and the establishment of databases. As with the Second Edition, we anticipate translating the Third Edition into Arabic for the WANA region and into French, particularly for North Africa.
We encourage all recipients to continue providing feedback regarding the manual's utility for their specific situations and to report any errors, if present.
The table of contents outlines the structure of the manual, detailing various chapters and sub-sections. It starts with an introduction and progresses through topics related to laboratory facilities, quality control, and data handling, beginning on page 7. Subsequent sections cover soil sampling and processing, followed by detailed analyses of soil physical and chemical properties. Specific sub-sections include laboratory organization, safety, and standardization procedures, as well as various methods for analyzing soil moisture, particle size distribution, bulk density, and chemical composition. Each section is numbered and assigned page references, allowing for easy navigation through the document.

The idea that one could test or analyze soil to obtain information about its properties—especially its acidity, alkalinity, and nutrient status—is well established, tracing back to the origins of scientific inquiry into soil. Analyzing plants to reflect the fertility status of the soil in which they grow is a more recent development. However, visual crop observations date back to ancient Greece, if not earlier. In the past few decades, driven by agricultural commercialization and the demand for increased output from limited or diminishing land resources, both soil and plant analysis methods have been developed and continue to evolve.
While all these approaches can be used in research, soil testing is the most amenable and forms the basis for recommendations to farmers. On the other hand, plant analysis serves as a post-mortem approach and should be interpreted alongside soil test results.
Soil testing has become an intrinsic part of modern farming practices in the West and in many developing countries. These tests primarily focus on the essential nutrients demanded by crops, which are typically supplied by fertilizers: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). In some regions, particularly based on soil types, tests may also include secondary nutrients like calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S). In arid areas, micronutrients such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and boron (B) are frequently measured, as deficiencies of these elements are often associated with calcareous soils. Furthermore, such regions may experience excessive or toxic levels of certain elements, such as boron (B) or high concentrations of sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg), which can adversely affect soil physical properties. Because nutrient behavior in soils is influenced by soil properties and environmental conditions, measuring these properties is essential. Key measurements include pH, salinity, organic matter (OM), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), as well as texture and aggregate stability. In drier regions, the presence of gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) is also a concern.
Sample Collection: Samples must be collected in a way that accurately reflects the average status of a field concerning the parameters being tested.
Extraction or Digestion and Nutrient Determination: The reagents used and procedures adopted should effectively extract and represent the elements in the soil that are related to plant availability, correlating with plant growth.
Interpreting the Analytical Results: Measurement units should clearly indicate whether a nutrient is deficient, adequate, or excessive (and potentially toxic to plants).
Fertilizer Recommendation: Recommendations are based on the soil test, calibrated for specific field conditions, and consider additional factors such as yield targets, crop nutrient requirements, management practices, soil type, and fertilizer application methods.
It is important to emphasize that a soil test, even if reliable and accurate, is only one factor in making fertilization decisions. Numerous other factors affect crop growth and yield, including soil type and environmental conditions such as moisture and temperature. Due to the varying forms of nutrients in soils (e.g., calcareous vs. acidic soils), soil tests can be quite diverse, particularly for available phosphorus and micronutrients, and to a lesser extent for nitrogen (Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Page et al., 1982; Sparks et al., 1966). Nitrogen, being mobile in soils and subject to mineralization and immobilization, presents specific challenges in establishing a reliable test. In contrast, tests for potassium (K), pH, organic matter (OM), and calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are more straightforward.
The literature on soil testing is extensive and diverse. Notable examples include monographs from the American Society of Agronomy, which focus on Physical (Klute, 1986) and Chemical Analysis (Page, 1982), providing detailed descriptions of all available soil tests and their modifications. Publications from the Soil Science Society of America (Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Page et al., 1982; Westerman, 1990; Sparks et al., 1996) offer a broader perspective on the philosophy, procedures, and laboratory operations for soil and plant analysis, including interpretation criteria for specific crops. These monographs are regularly updated.

While most soil testing resources originate from Western countries, publications from the Food and Agriculture Organization of the United Nations (FAO, 1970; 1980) have a more international focus and consider the perspectives of developing countries. In these regions, soil testing is often underdeveloped or nonexistent, and research in soil testing and plant analysis can be sporadic and of questionable relevance.
This brings attention to the West Asia – North Africa (WANA) region, supported by the International Center for Agricultural Research in the Dry Areas (ICARDA). The establishment of the Soil Test Calibration Network at ICARDA has been a key catalyst for promoting soil testing and optimizing soil and fertilizer resource use in the region. The evolution and potential impact of this initiative can be observed through papers presented at various workshops, including those in Aleppo (1986, Soltanpour, 1987), Ankara (1987, Matar et al., 1988), Amman (1988, Ryan and Matar, 1990), Agadir (1991, Ryan and Matar, 1992), and finally in Aleppo (1995, Ryan, 1997).
Central to the Network and ICARDA’s operations is the Soil, Plant, and Water Analysis Laboratory. Unlike many governmental and educational laboratories in the region, its facilities have been developed without certain constraints. Most procedures adopted by the laboratory are based on validated regional research.
A critical component of any effective laboratory is a clearly presented list of appropriate tests that can be routinely followed by laboratory technicians conducting soil testing and plant analysis. Consequently, this manual targets the technical staff throughout the region. Each test includes a brief introduction to ensure technicians understand the significance of their work, as well as the expected range of values for soils and plants in the region, aiding them in identifying gross errors. We have selected the most suitable methods for each test and presented them in a clear, stepwise manner.
We have also presented material on laboratory organization and safety aspects, which are often overlooked by technical staff but significantly impact their work output and reliability. Additionally, the Appendices contain useful information on related practical aspects such as abbreviations, conversion factors, atomic weights, solution concentrations, the effect of pH on soil conditions, summarized soil test methodologies, plant sampling guidelines, criteria for interpreting soil and plant analysis data, soil salinity, and interpretations of boron toxicity.
Soil, plant, and water analyses are conducted by various institutions in both the public and private sectors. Laboratories operate under several entities, including Ministries of Agriculture, National Research and Teaching Institutes, International Organizations, and Commercial Companies.
To be most effective, analytical services should be closely linked to extension/advisory services and should maintain a functional relationship with universities and research stations. The type of facility for such analyses depends on the institution it serves, the nature of the clientele, and the volume of samples to be analyzed. Nevertheless, all laboratories, regardless of size, should be designed to facilitate operational efficiency, minimize contamination, and produce reliable and repeatable results.
Various publications address management considerations in the design and operation of soil testing (e.g., Walsh and Beaton, 1973). While the benefits of standardized laboratory designs are clear, many laboratories in the WANA region exhibit apparent deficiencies in this regard (Ryan, 2000; Ryan et al., 1999). Too often, soil samples are stored, or worse, ground in wet chemistry laboratories. Similarly, many laboratories are arranged in ways that inadvertently hinder efficient use of staff resources.
Soil, plant, and water analysis facilities should be located in the same building and operate under unified administration. The Soil, Plant, and Water Analysis Laboratory of ICARDA was designed in the 1980s with these considerations in mind. The various components of the laboratory reflect a logical activity framework. While no two laboratories are identical or equipped with the same tools, the details provided for ICARDA’s laboratory should serve as a general guideline for laboratory arrangement and the types of equipment needed for routine, service-oriented operations.
Soil Preparation Room: This area receives large bulk samples transported by truck, where they are dried and sieved. It is equipped with a large-capacity oven, freezers, a soil grinder, containers and trays, stainless steel soil sieve sets, vacuum pumps, sample dividers, various types of soil sampling tools (such as augers, spades, and metal rings), an exhaust hood, and a compressed-air machine. Soil samples (~0.5 kg) are dried and placed in clean containers before being transferred to the soil testing laboratory for the requested analyses.
All samples are retained for at least two years post-analysis, while bulk samples of special soil types are kept indefinitely. An inventory or catalog of all soil samples is maintained. In some cases, it is necessary to temporarily store large numbers of samples in cold conditions, such as a freezer room, pending analysis. Without such conditions, any delay in analysis could result in bacterial changes in soil samples that would compromise the analytical results.
The traditional analytical processes of weighing, stirring, shaking, filtering under suction, heating, drying, incubating, and centrifuging are performed almost exclusively with the aid of electrical machines and devices. Additionally, the digestion and preparation of reagents are conducted in a fume hood. This is also where soil extraction, when necessary, is carried out for analysis. This facility is typically equipped with various instruments, including an atomic absorption spectrophotometer, computer, refrigerator, and more.
This room is designated for receiving dried soil sub-samples in the soil testing laboratory for requested analyses. It is equipped with several instruments, such as a pF instrument for measuring field capacity and permanent wilting point, a soil dispersing stirrer (a high-speed electric stirrer with a cup receptacle) for determining particle size distribution, and aggregate stability instruments for both wet and dry methods. Additional equipment includes balances, permeability apparatus, and a water bath.
In this room, traditional analytical processes are conducted, including measurements of pH, electrical conductivity, and the analysis of anions and cations.
Safety is a crucial consideration in soil, plant, and water analysis laboratories, often overlooked. Working safely in a chemical laboratory requires special care in both the design and construction of the laboratory building and in the handling and use of chemicals. The release of gases and fumes during specific analytical operations is controlled through fume hoods or trapped in acidic/alkaline solutions, washed through flowing water. Some chemical reactions, if not handled properly, can lead to explosions.
Analytical processes typically performed at room temperature can be affected by temperature variations; thus, an analysis conducted in a “cold” room may yield different results than one performed in a “hot” room. Many chemicals are sensitive to the temperature and humidity conditions of their storage, particularly when these conditions fluctuate. The laboratory air temperature should ideally be maintained at a constant level (usually between 20 and 25 °C), with humidity kept around 50%.
All staff, regardless of grade, technical skill, or employment status, should receive training on safety aspects upon starting work, with periodic reminders to encourage familiarity with regulations. Ideally, safety posters should be prominently displayed in the laboratory.

Wear appropriate footwear; sandals are not permitted in the lab.
Carefully pour liquid wastes down the sink with enough water to dilute and flush them away, keeping local disposal ordinances in mind.
Dispose of chipped or broken glassware in specially marked containers.
Posters depicting First Aid procedures for laboratory accidents should be prominently displayed. These posters are not merely decorative; they serve to protect laboratory personnel, who must be thoroughly familiar with all relevant procedures and potential emergencies.
If the laboratory is part of a larger institution, the laboratory staff should be acquainted with the Safety Officer or the person responsible for safety. In smaller operations, one staff member should be designated as responsible for safety.
The air-dry moisture content in a soil sample taken directly from a hot and humid storeroom (or a very cold one) may differ from that of a similar sample stored in an air-conditioned laboratory, even if both are weighed for analysis simultaneously as “air-dry” samples.
The tap water supplied to a laboratory should be entirely free from pollution, as free as possible from insoluble matter, and maintain good and steady hydrostatic pressure. It may be necessary to filter the water for certain equipment.
Drainage should ideally lead to a main drain or a suitably sized soak-away. Effluents from soil laboratories often contain substantial quantities of waste soil, in addition to acidic and alkaline liquids. The design of the drainage system should facilitate periodic cleaning and removal of solid waste.
The following information synthesizes the manual by Okalebo et al. (1993). Quality control is a crucial aspect of effective laboratory practice. During routine analyses, errors can gradually emerge due to factors such as contamination, changes in reagent quality, environmental variations, operator errors, and instrument calibration or failure. Achieving maximum reproducibility and adequate accuracy in results are the primary objectives.
Repeated measurements of an air-dried soil sample should yield consistent results when analyzed over time using standard chemical procedures. Deviations of observed values from their true values may stem from systematic or random errors. Systematic errors, once identified, are generally easier to correct than random errors.
To ensure laboratory quality control, three essential precautions should routinely be included among the test samples: the use of blanks, repeats, and internal references.
When introducing a new procedure, its accuracy must be evaluated and compared to existing methods. Both procedures should be tested on a homogeneous sample using ten replicates, with the standard deviation calculated for each set to measure precision. Known amounts of reagent should be added to this homogeneous sample, and the procedures repeated. The mean and standard deviation of the results should then be calculated. The correlation between the increases in the measured values and the known increases in test sample concentration serves as a test of accuracy. For procedures where the test material interacts with the added reagent, such as with phosphorus-sorptive soils, this test can be conducted using reagent solutions.
At least 1 in 10 samples selected from the test materials and placed at random within the batch should be analyzed in duplicate. The choice of analyzing 1 in 10 samples is a suggested compromise between the ideal of analyzing all samples in duplicate and the time, effort, and expense involved in doing so. The analytical results for given pairs of duplicate repeats should closely resemble one another; generally, repeat values should fall within ±2.5% to ±5.0% of their mean, depending on the analysis in question. Any greater discrepancy must be investigated. If repeat values are not consistent, the entire batch should be re-analyzed.
Internal reference samples are necessary for each type of test material and analysis conducted within the laboratory. The internal sample should not be the same as the homogeneous material routinely used in testing new methods and analytical techniques. A sample obtained from a large, well-mixed, and homogeneous composite bulk sample should be included in each batch analyzed. Variation from the mean, as calculated over previous batches, may indicate an error.
Analytical results for the internal reference may be plotted on a quality control chart to monitor the performance of the analyses over time. Corrective action should be taken if a single value exceeds the ±3 standard deviation limits or if two successive values exceed the ±2 standard deviation limits. Periodically, the critical limits could be reassessed by recalculating the overall standard deviation of the internal reference sample as more data are accumulated.
Results can only be validly compared to one another when they have been obtained using standardized methods. Collaboration between laboratories can be improved by exchanging reference materials and comparing their results (Ryan and Garabet, 1994). Such materials are referred to as "External References." An example of standardization is the exchange network of ISRIC (International Soil Reference and Information Center) in Wageningen, The Netherlands, which operates international soil and plant analytical exchange programs.
Most external reference samples are costly, and their frequent use increases the operating costs of the laboratory. Internal reference samples are usually much less expensive. Therefore, if a relationship between external and internal reference samples can be firmly established, frequent use of internal reference samples, with occasional use of external reference samples, can reduce costs while still providing acceptable quality assurance.
In analytical work, the concepts of accuracy and precision are crucial.
Accuracy is a measure of systematic error or the degree of agreement of an experimental value with the true or expected value of the quantity of concern. While accuracy is important, it is also crucial to know when to use a given analytical method and to understand its limitations.
Precision is a measure of reproducibility affected by random error, typically described by the standard deviation, standard error, or confidence interval.
A considerable amount of information is generated in any soil, plant, and water analysis laboratory. To economically justify the existence of a laboratory, it is necessary to maintain a record of the number of samples analyzed and the types of analyses performed. With the advent of computers, such storage is straightforward, and retrieval is greatly facilitated.
In order to facilitate data processing, standard information sheets are required. These sheets vary from laboratory to laboratory but usually include details of the analyses required for the sample, as well as information on the crop to be grown, the soil type, and the previous cropping history, particularly regarding fertilization. Such information enables researchers to address questions about the extent of nutrient deficiency in any area from which samples were obtained and how fertility levels change over the years.
Computer programs are increasingly used to interpret soil test data and make fertilizer recommendations. Several such programs are available. Standardized report forms for making fertilizer recommendations combine soil test data inputs with other soil and crop information. To achieve this, the tests used (e.g., soil NO3-N, available P) must be calibrated with field crop response.
With a relatively large output of analyses associated with numerous on-station and on-farm research trials, analytical results from ICARDA’s laboratory are stored in a computer program that generates fertilizer recommendations based on soil test values. Where soil maps and rainfall data are available, the accumulated soil test values from known locations can help establish relationships with soil type, region, and climatic zone.
While the main focus of this manual is to present an easy-to-use methodology for soil testing and, to a lesser extent, for plant analysis, related aspects are also important. Therefore, a brief description of these aspects follows.
Much attention is given to laboratory procedures, but the process of obtaining soil for analysis—soil sampling—is often overlooked or poorly considered. A good sampling plan should provide a measure of the average fertility level of a field and indicate its variability. If a sample is not representative of the field or is incorrectly taken, the resulting analytical data are either meaningless or difficult to interpret. The error in field sampling is generally much greater than that due to chemical analysis. Thus, obtaining a representative soil sample from a field is the most crucial step for making a meaningful soil analysis.
Composite Sampling: At ICARDA, eight sub-samples are taken per hectare (ha) in a diagonal pattern to obtain one composite sample. Other plans may range from 5 to 25 borings or sub-samples per composite sample, with sample units varying from 2 to 8 ha.
Fewer sub-samples are needed where little or no fertilizer has been used. Sampling areas are often traversed in a zigzag pattern to provide a uniform distribution of sampling sites.
Conversely, more sub-samples are required where fertility is variable due to hand broadcasting of fertilizers or cropping-livestock systems. Banding of fertilizer poses significant challenges for reliable sampling.
Thus, the number of sub-samples taken by farmers should be realistic, considering the specific field situation.
Soil samples can be collected anytime soil conditions permit, but sampling directly after fertilization or amendment application should be avoided.
In the WANA region, it is recommended that soil sampling be carried out in autumn (before planting) if fertilization is intended at planting.
It is important to sample at similar times year after year to facilitate comparisons of analyses at regular time intervals.
For most purposes, soil sampling is conducted to a depth of about 20 cm. The availability of phosphorus (P), nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), and micronutrients in these samples is related to crop growth and nutrient uptake.
In some cases, especially in irrigated areas, sampling to a depth of 60–100 cm is desirable, particularly for monitoring nitrate (NO3-N) leaching.
Depth-wise soil samples should also be taken where there are concerns about boron (B) toxicity.
A uniform slice should be taken from the surface to the depth of insertion of the tool; the same volume of soil should be obtained in each sub-sample.
Augers generally meet these requirements. In areas where the topsoil is dry, such as during summer, topsoil sampling can be done using a metal ring. Soil can be dug out from inside the ring because it is almost impossible to sample dry topsoil with an auger.
Soil samples for micronutrient analysis should be taken using a stainless steel auger or, at a minimum, an ungalvanized auger (since the galvanized coating is zinc oxide).
Researchers typically use augers for field sampling. Farmers and extension agents may use shovels or trowels as alternatives.
Dig a V-shaped hole 15 to 20 cm deep. Then take a fine, thick slice from the smooth side.
Trim the sides, leaving a fine strip, and then dump this strip into a clean bucket. Break the clods and mix thoroughly. Remove large rocks, pieces of sod, earthworms, etc. Put the soil into the sample container and label it clearly.
For moist soil, a tube auger or spade is considered satisfactory. For harder soil, a screw auger may be more convenient.
Disturbed soil samples should be placed in plastic bags (tags and markers are required), or aluminum or stainless steel boxes.
Depending on subsequent analysis, samples may need to be kept cool until laboratory analysis.
Bags should be examined for cleanliness and strength.
Soil samples can be transported to the laboratory in cardboard boxes or sacks.
All information about samples should be recorded, and each sample should be assigned a laboratory number.
Sketch your field and diagram it as you sampled it, ensuring that sampled areas are labeled consistently with sample containers. This ensures you have a record of which recommendations apply to which areas—do not rely on memory.
The information sheet should be clearly written with a pencil. Fill out the information sheets thoroughly; the more information you provide with each sample, the better the recommendations will be.
Avoid sampling unusual areas, such as unevenly fertilized regions, old channels, old bunds, areas near trees, and sites of previous compost piles or other unrepresentative locations.
Prevent contamination at all stages. Soil samples should never be stored alongside fertilizers or detergents. Contamination can occur when soil samples are spread out to dry near stored fertilizers or on floors where fertilizers were previously stored.
Collect samples from the middle of the rows when crops have been planted in rows to avoid areas where fertilizer has been band-placed.
Preparation for Laboratory Processing: Handling in the laboratory should be performed with care to maintain the integrity of the samples.
The soil-fresh sample received in the laboratory should be analyzed directly after sampling to determine nitrate, nitrite, and ammonium levels. These samples should not be dried; results will be expressed on an oven-dry basis by separately estimating moisture content in the samples. If short-term storage is unavoidable, samples must be kept in a fridge at a temperature close to 0 °C (but not below zero!). The lag time between field sampling and analysis must be minimized, as storage time will inevitably introduce an additional factor that can influence the analysis results.
The soil-fresh samples should be dried in wooden or enameled trays. The trays can be numbered, or a plastic tag could be attached to ensure the identity of each sample is maintained at all stages of preparation.
During drying, the soils should be allowed to dry in the air. Alternatively, the trays may be placed in racks in a hot air cabinet, where the temperature should not exceed 35 °C and humidity should be maintained between 30% and 60%. Excessive oven-drying can adversely affect the availability of most nutrients present in the samples.
Air-drying is recommended for some nutrients since it has a negligible effect on total nitrogen content; however, the ammonium (NH4) and nitrate (NO3) content in the soil can change with time and temperature. Additionally, microbial biomass is significantly affected by drying at high temperatures.
After drying, the samples should be ground with a wooden pestle and mortar in a preparation room separate from the main laboratory. Clods and large aggregates should be crushed and mixed.
It is essential to avoid breaking pebbles, concretions, and stones during the grinding process, and care should be taken not to crush individual soil particles. The entire sample should be passed through a sieve, except for concretions and pebbles larger than 2 mm.
After grinding, the soil should be screened through a 2-mm sieve. The coarse portion retained on the sieve should be returned to the mortar for further grinding (excluding concretions, pebbles, and organic residues). Repeat the sieving and grinding process until all aggregate particles are fine enough to pass through the 2-mm sieve.
To facilitate storage and handling, it is necessary to reduce the size of the large sample. A random method of sub-sampling is essential. Sample splitting can be performed using a mechanical sample splitter, such as a Riffle-type Sample Splitter, which divides the sample in half through a series of chutes. This process can be repeated as many times as necessary.
Another method for reducing sample size is by quartering. The sample is spread uniformly over a plastic or paper sheet and divided into four equal portions. Portions 2 and 3 should be collected and thoroughly mixed, while the remainder is discarded.
After the drying and preparation processes, half of the dried soil sub-sample should be placed in a clean container and transferred to the soil testing laboratory for the requested analysis. The remaining sample should be stored in cardboard boxes in a storage room.
Soil physical measurements vary widely depending on the study's objectives in agriculture. These measurements generally include aspects such as soil water content, infiltration, hydraulic conductivity, evapotranspiration, heat, temperature, reflectivity, porosity, particle size, bulk density, aggregate stability, and particle size distribution.
Soil moisture is routinely measured using field-moist samples, as all physical analyses are expressed on an oven-dry basis (16-18 hours of drying at 105 °C). Texture, which indicates whether the soil is sandy or clayey, is crucial for understanding nutrient behavior. Therefore, particle size distribution analysis is often performed, particularly when more precision is needed than what the qualitative physical "feel" approach provides for determining texture.
In arid to semi-arid regions, water is the most limiting factor, making soil moisture determination critically important. Soil moisture impacts crop growth not only by influencing nutrient availability but also by affecting nutrient transformations and soil biological behavior. Consequently, at ICARDA, soil moisture is routinely measured in most field trials. While it can be assessed in the field using a neutron probe, the gravimetric approach offers more flexibility, allowing samples to be easily taken from various soil conditions. All laboratory analyses are related to an air- or oven-dry basis, so it is essential to consider the actual soil moisture content (Sparks et al., 1966).
Weigh 10 g of air-dry soil (sieved to < 2 mm) into a previously dried (at 105 °C) and weighed metal can with a lid.
Dry the sample in an oven with the lid off at 105 °C overnight (typically for 24 hours).
The next day, after the soil has dried, use tongs to remove the container from the oven, fit the lid, cool it in a desiccator for at least 30 minutes, and then reweigh it.
The wet soil sample should be kept loosely in the container.
Care must be taken to avoid overheating the soil by maintaining the oven temperature between 105 °C and 110 °C.
The dried soil sample should not be left uncovered before weighing.
For litter and humus samples, dry them at 70 °C for 48 hours.
Hygroscopic moisture, which is moisture content in air-dry samples, varies from less than 0.2% for sand to over 8% for materials similar to leaf litter or organic matter, depending on the storage area's relative humidity and the fineness of the soil particles. Samples should be air-dried prior to moisture content determination.
Moisture content values reproducible to within ± 0.5% can be achieved.
The oven should be monitored periodically to ensure temperature fluctuations do not exceed 5 °C.
Select a uniform plot measuring 5 m x 5 m and create a flat, horizontal area.
Remove any loose material from the surface (weeds, pebbles, etc.).
Construct bunds around the plot.
Fill the plot with sufficient water to completely saturate the soil.
Cover the plot with a polythene sheet to minimize evaporation.
After 24 hours of saturation, collect a soil sample from the center of the plot at the desired layer and measure moisture content daily until values stabilize.
Record the weight of the oven-dry soil.
Repeat daily until a constant oven-dry weight is achieved.
Air-dry compost and soil samples thoroughly.
Attach and clamp tubing to the bottom of the funnel and secure the funnel to the ring stand.
Place filter paper in the funnel.
Add a 100 mL sample to the funnel—do not compact it.
Measure 100 mL of water using the graduated cylinder.
Gradually add water to the sample until it is fully covered, recording the amount of water added.
Stir gently and allow the sample to sit until fully saturated.
Release the clamp and collect the excess water in the graduated cylinder (measured in mL).
Record the water volume in the cylinder.
Calculate the water retained in the 100 mL sample of compost, soil, or mixture, then convert to water-holding capacity per liter of soil by multiplying by 10.
Water-holding capacity is expressed as the amount of water retained per liter of soil.
Estimates of soil water-holding capacity (WHC), wilting point, and texture can be made from the saturated moisture content, generally reproducible within ±12%, depending on soil texture.
Plot daily readings on graph paper; the lowest reading indicates the field capacity of the soil.
Soil particles vary widely within any soil type, and their cementation results in a range of aggregate shapes and sizes. For standard particle size measurement, the soil fraction passing through a 2-mm sieve is considered. Laboratory procedures estimate the percentage of sand (0.05 – 2.0 mm), silt (0.002 – 0.05 mm), and clay (<0.002 mm) fractions in soils.
Particle size distribution is vital for soil classification and affects water, aeration, and nutrient availability to plants. Soil texture influences agricultural suitability, roadbed construction, septic disposal systems, and overall fertility, drainage, and bearing strength. Texture is therefore a standard physical soil test.
Primary soil particles are typically cemented by organic matter, which must be removed using hydrogen peroxide (H2O2) treatment. If significant amounts of calcium carbonate (CaCO3) are present, the actual percentages of sand, silt, or clay can only be accurately determined after dissolving CaCO3. Common procedures for particle size analysis include the hydrometer method and the pipette-gravimetric method.
In practice, the density of water and its viscosity are both affected by temperature. Therefore, we must know and make corrections for the temperature of the liquid. Higher temperatures result in reduced viscosity due to liquid expansion, leading to a more rapid descent of falling particles.
Soil dispersing stirrer: A high-speed electric stirrer with a cup receptacle.
Hydrometer with Bouyoucos scale (g/L) as per ASTM 152H.
Dissolve 40 g of sodium hexametaphosphate [(NaPO₃)₁₃] and 10 g of sodium carbonate (Na₂CO₃) in deionized (DI) water, bringing the total volume to 1 L. This solution deteriorates over time and should not be kept for more than 1 to 2 weeks.
Weigh 40 g of air-dry soil (2 mm) into a 600 mL beaker.
Add 60 mL of the dispersing solution.
Cover the beaker with a watch glass and let it sit overnight.
The next day, quantitatively transfer the contents of the beaker to a soil-stirring cup and fill the cup to about three-quarters with water.
Stir the suspension at high speed for 3 minutes using the special stirrer. If no stirrer is available, shake the suspension overnight.
Rinse the stirring paddle into a cup and allow it to stand for 1 minute.
Transfer the suspension quantitatively into a 1 L calibrated cylinder (hydrometer jar) and fill to the mark with water.
Dilute 60 mL of the dispersing solution to 1 L in a hydrometer jar with water.
Mix well, insert the hydrometer, and take the hydrometer reading, Rb.
The blank reading must be redetermined for temperature changes of more than 2 °C from 20 °C.
Mix the suspension in the hydrometer jar using a special paddle. Withdraw the paddle and immediately insert the hydrometer.
If necessary, disperse any froth with one drop of amyl alcohol, and take the hydrometer reading 40 seconds after withdrawing the paddle. This gives the reading, Rsc.
Mix the suspension in the hydrometer jar with the paddle; withdraw the paddle and leave the suspension undisturbed.
After 4 hours, insert the hydrometer and take the reading, RC.
After obtaining the readings for clay and silt, pour the suspension quantitatively through a 50-μm sieve.
Wash the sieve until the water passing through is clear.
Transfer the sand quantitatively from the sieve to a 50 mL beaker of known weight.
Allow the sand in the beaker to settle, then decant excess water.
Dry the beaker with sand overnight at 105 °C.
Cool in a desiccator and reweigh the beaker with sand.
If possible, all hydrometer jars should be placed in a water bath at a constant temperature (20 °C); in this case, temperature corrections are not needed.
For temperature correction, use a value of 0.4 for each degree temperature difference from 20 °C. Add or subtract this factor based on whether the temperature is higher or lower than 20 °C, respectively.
All results of mechanical analysis should be expressed on the basis of oven-dry soil (16-24 hours drying at 105 °C).
In the above procedure, carbonates and organic matter are not removed from the soil.
The hydrometer method, as described in this section, cannot be applied to soils that contain free gypsum (gypsiferous soils). For gypsiferous soils, refer to Hesse (1971).
The sum of silt, clay, and sand should equal 100%. Any deviation from 100% indicates the degree of accuracy.
The material not passing through the sieve is weighed and reported as a percentage of the air-dry weight of the whole sample.
Weigh 40 g of air-dried soil (2-mm fraction) into a 600-mL beaker.
Add 60 mL of dispersing solution.
Cover the beaker with a watch glass and leave it overnight.
The next day, quantitatively transfer the contents of the beaker to a soil stirring cup, filling the cup to about three-quarters with water. Using a soil stirring device, stir the suspension at high speed for 2 minutes.
Transfer the suspension quantitatively into a 1-L calibrated cylinder (hydrometer jar) and bring it to volume with water.
Place the volumetric cylinders in a large temperature-controlled water bath on a vibration-free table. The temperature of the water must be maintained as constant as possible, using a heating element with a thermostat and stirring element.
Insert the stirring paddle into the volumetric cylinder. Shake it up and down, mixing the suspension intensively for 20 cycles. Remove the stirring paddle and wait until the swirling motion has settled into a steady state under gravity.
Start the timer or stopwatch. Allow the suspension to settle for 4 hours.
The suspension must be completely homogenous; otherwise, particles may aggregate. One indication of incomplete suspension is the formation of stratification in the measuring cylinder.
About 30 seconds before the appropriate sampling time, lower the pipette (previously fixed above the center of the cylinder) slowly until the tip just touches the surface of the suspension. Note the vertical scale reading, then lower the pipette to the required depth. Fill the pipette by gentle and steady suction (the pipette should have a capacity of around 20 mL).
Remove the pipette from the suspension. Transfer the aliquot to an evaporating dish and wash the pipette twice with water, adding the washings to the dish.
Dry the evaporating dish with the suspension until it has evaporated down.
Determine the mass percentage of the pipette fraction by weighing.
Decant the cylinder sediments and suspension into analytical sieves to calculate the sand fractions.
Repeat the sampling a second time after remixing the suspension with the stirring paddle.
Evaporate to dryness on a water bath, then dry the residue in an oven at 105°C for 16-18 hours. Cool in desiccators and weigh to the nearest 0.2 mg.
Ensure that the two-way cock (K1) and the cock (K3) of the pipette are closed, while the two-way cock (K2) is opened towards the pipette before placing the pipette over the measuring cylinder with the suspension, 30 seconds before pipetting.
Insert the pipette into the suspension at the required depth, lowering it slowly to avoid disturbance.
Connect the exhaust point (A) to the pipette balloon.
Open the two-way cock (K1) and steadily draw the pipette full until the liquid level is above the two-way cock (K2).
Close the two-way cocks (K1) and (K2).
Move the runner to the right (outside the glass tank).
Open the two-way cock (K2) above the drain (D) to drain off any excess suspension.
Rinse the overflow ball (F) with water from the storage ball (W) by opening cock (K3).
Open the two-way cock (K2) above the pipette (P).
Open the two-way cock (K1) above the drain (E) and empty the pipette into an evaporating dish.
Rinse the pipette (P) with water from the storage ball (W), collecting the rinsate in the same evaporating dish.
Open the two-way cock (K1) above the pipette point (S) and remove the pipette from the suspension.
Collect the suspension from the pipette in the evaporating dish.
Mix the suspension intensively for at least 1 minute and start the chronometer. After the prescribed sedimentation time, pipette the particles ≤ 2 μm to determine the lutum content. Lower the pipette slowly to avoid disturbing the sediment.
To determine the particle-size distribution, first pipette the fraction smaller than or equal to 35 μm, and subsequently pipette the other desired fractions in descending order according to particle size.
Upper limit particle fraction in µm after a sedimentation time of [insert time].
Terminal velocity is attained as soon as settling begins.
Settling and resistance are entirely due to the viscosity of the fluid.
Particles are assumed to be smooth and spherical.
There is no interaction between individual particles in the solution.
It is recommended to use horizontal reciprocation to disperse the samples. The use of an electric stirrer at high revolutions per minute (rpm) may result in significant grinding of the sample's primary minerals.
For soils with clay particle densities <2.65 g/cm³, settling time increases; for soils >2.65 g/cm³, settling time decreases.
An error of 0.001 ± g in the dry weight of the pipette sample results in an error of ± 0.32% for the clay size fraction.
Since soil particles are not smooth and spherical, the radius of the particle is considered an equivalent rather than an actual radius. In this method, particle density is assumed to be 2.65 g/cm³ and the density of liquid is assumed to be 1 g/cm³.
Water density and viscosity at different temperatures.
Soil structure is defined as the arrangement of soil particles. This includes not only sand, silt, and clay but also the aggregates or structural elements formed by the aggregation of smaller mechanical fractions. The size, shape, and character of soil structure can vary, appearing as cubes, prisms, or plates. Based on size, soil structure is classified as follows: very coarse (>10 mm), coarse (5-10 mm), medium (2-5 mm), fine (1-2 mm), and very fine (<1 mm). Depending on the stability of the aggregate and the ease of separation, soil structure can be characterized as poorly developed, weakly developed, moderately developed, well developed, or highly developed.

Collect the soil sample using the metal ring by pressing it into the bulk soil (preferably when moist) until it is level with the surface. Avoid excessive compaction or fragmentation of the soil. Remove the loose soil within the ring and collect it in a polyethylene bag.
Record all relevant information about the samples (depth and profile). Place one label inside the bag and tie another label to the outside. Bring the soil samples to the soil preparation laboratory.
Assign a laboratory number to each sample.
Spread the samples uniformly over a plastic or paper sheet and allow them to air dry. Prepare subsamples by 'quartering.' Cone the mixed soil material in the center of the mixing sheet, ensuring symmetry with respect to fine and coarse soil materials.
Calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil subsample (soil moisture content).
Weigh the soil subsamples to the nearest 0.1 g.
Prepare the sieving tower by stacking the sieves, starting with the smallest opening and adding a pan at the bottom. To avoid leakage, ensure that O-rings are placed between individual sieves, between the bottom sieve and the sieve pan, and between the top sieve and the clamping lid.
Gently pour the collected soil aggregates onto the top of the nest of sieves, which typically have round openings of 5.0 mm, 2.0 mm, 1.0 mm, 0.5 mm, and 0.25 mm.
Cover the top sieve with the lid and place the nest of sieves on the rotary shaker.
Switch on the shaker for 10 minutes. Afterward, remove the sieves, collect the soil retained on each sieve into pre-weighed aluminum cans using a small brush, and weigh the cans with the soil.
Analyze a duplicate sample following the same procedure and calculate the percent distribution of dry aggregates retained on each sieve.
If the percentage of dry aggregates on the 5-mm sieve exceeds 25%, transfer these aggregates to a nest of sieves with 25 mm, 10 mm, and 5 mm openings along with a pan. Cover the top sieve containing the aggregates with a lid and place the nest of sieves on the rotary sieve shaker. Switch on the motor for 10 minutes and follow the above steps (5, 6, 7) for estimating aggregate size distribution.
Use work gloves to protect your hands and wear a mask and other personal protective equipment to shield against dust.
The fume hood is the best location for using the rotary sieve shaker.
The number and sizes of aggregate-size classes collected depend on the objective of the experiment.
The soil sample should be moist and friable. It is broken by applying mild stress into smaller aggregates that can pass through an 8-mm screen. The sieved soil sample is placed on a watch glass for wetting, using either vacuum soaking or immersion methods. Various methods can yield aggregates of different sizes, such as samples under vacuum and sieving under water. Among the different procedures, wetting the samples under vacuum is preferred as the rate of wetting influences the slaking of crumbs. The sieving time ranges from 10 to 30 minutes depending on the wetting method. However, sieving under water more closely resembles the disruptive actions of water and other mechanical forces.
Two sets of sieves (20 cm diameter and 5 cm height) with screen openings of 0.5 mm and 0.2 mm diameter.
Soil Dispersion Stirrer: High-speed electric with a cup receptacle.
Dissolve 50 g of sodium hexametaphosphate in deionized (DI) water and bring to a 1-L volume. This solution deteriorates over time and should not be stored for more than 1 to 2 weeks.
Dissolve 40 g of sodium hydroxide in DI water and bring to a 1-L volume.
Collect the soil sample using the metal ring by pressing it into the bulk soil sample (preferably when moist) until it is level with the surface. Avoid excessive compaction or fragmentation of the soil.
Remove the loose soil within the ring and collect it in a polyethylene bag.
Record all relevant information about the samples (depth and profile), place one label inside the bag, and tie the other label to the bag. Then, transport the soil samples to the soil preparation laboratory.
Assign a laboratory number to each sample.
Spread the samples uniformly over a plastic or paper sheet to air-dry. Field-moist samples may be used if air-drying is assumed to affect aggregates (e.g., “self-mulching soils”). Prepare subsamples by ‘quartering’. Cone the mixed soil material in the center of the mixing sheet, ensuring symmetry regarding fine and coarse soil materials.
Calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil subsample (soil moisture content).
Weigh 50 g of air-dry soil (<2 mm).
Gently pour the collected soil aggregates into the standard metal ring (placing filter paper and a small plastic dish underneath the ring).
Add 50 mL of tap water (allowing it to soak underneath) to saturate the soil sample. Leave the wetted soil samples for 30 minutes.
Transfer the set saturated soil sample into two sieves: 0.5 mm (top) and 0.2 mm (bottom). Place any larger sieve above the first sieve to contain the surface water in the tank.
Remove the bottom pan and attach the nest of sieves to the Yoder-type wet sieve shaker.
Fill the drum (which holds the set of sieves) with salt-free water at 20-25 °C to a level just below the screen in the top sieve when the sieves are in the highest position. Then lower the sieves-nest to wet the soil for 10 minutes.
Bring the nest of sieves to the initial position and adjust the water level so that the screen in the top sieve is covered with water in its highest position. Switch on the mechanical oscillator to move the sieves-nest up and down at a frequency of 30-35 cycles/minute and a stroke of 3.8 cm.
Remove the sieves-nest from the water and allow it to drain for a while.
Transfer the soil resting on each screen with a stream of distilled water and a brush into a large aluminum pot (of known weight). Leave the washed water-stable aggregates in the pot for 4-6 hours to allow all suspended fractions to precipitate. Decant some of the water to reduce the drying period.
Dry the soil aggregate sample in an oven at 70 °C. Weigh the soil and aluminum pot to the nearest gram.
Soil bulk density (BD) is the ratio of the mass (oven-dry weight) of the soil to the bulk volume, expressed in grams per cubic centimeter (g/cm³) or tons per cubic meter (t/m³). This includes the volume of both solids and pore space at a specified soil water content (usually the moisture content at sampling). The BD may depend on soil conditions at the time of sampling. Changes in soil swelling due to variations in water content can alter BD. While the mass of the soil remains constant, the volume can change as the water content fluctuates.
Soil bulk density (BD) is an indirect measure of total pore space, which is influenced by soil texture and structure. The BD of fine-textured mineral soils typically ranges from about 1.0 to 1.5 g/cm³, while sandy soils generally have a BD ranging from 1.3 to 1.7 g/cm³. In contrast, the bulk density of organic soils is usually much lower than that of mineral soils, sometimes dropping as low as 0.4 g/cm³. Both bulk density and total pore space can be significantly altered by tillage operations.
There are two common methods for determining soil BD: one involving disturbed soil samples and the other utilizing undisturbed samples. The second method relies on consolidated soil masses, such as clods and cores.
This method is employed when it's impractical to obtain a consolidated soil sample, particularly in sandy soils and soils from greenhouses and nurseries, which tend to be loose and very friable.
Begin by removing any loose material from the surface, including the O horizon or any other surface materials. If sampling subsurface horizons, dig a large pit to the required depth.
Create a flat, horizontal area slightly larger than the sampling cylinder (a metal ring).
Position the cylinder on the soil surface (or subsurface horizon). Place one end of the cylinder—typically a ring measuring 75 mm in diameter and 50 mm in height, with a sharp cutting edge at the bottom and a removable top—into the soil while holding the other end. Hammer the cylinder into the soil until the top is flush with the surface, stopping periodically to check the depth. Avoid striking too frequently, as this could compress the soil inside the cylinder and yield inaccurate results.
Carefully dig around and beneath the cylinder to remove it. Use a knife to trim any excess soil flush with the cylinder's ends.
If the ends of the cylinder have small holes, these can be filled with soil. However, if the holes are too large, the sample should be discarded.
Place the sample in a plastic bag and label it appropriately. Do not put the cylinder itself in the bag, as the sharp edges may perforate it. Additionally, take a replicate sample and place it in a separate bag.
The volume of your samples corresponds to the volume of the cylinder.
In the laboratory, calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil in the cylinder by drying it at 104 °C until the weight is constant, typically after 24 hours.
BD is commonly calculated on an oven-dry basis, though it may be calculated differently for specific applications.
If the sample contains rock fragments, pass the wet sample through a 2-mm sieve, then dry, weigh, and record the weight of the rock fragments retained on the sieve. Determine the volume of the rock fragments based on their weight and an assumed particle density of 2.65 g/cm³, unless more accurate information is available. Subtract the weight of the rock fragments from the total weight of the sample and their volume from the total volume.
BD measurements should be taken at the soil surface and/or in compacted zones (such as a plow pan) if present.
To obtain a more representative BD measurement of the area, additional samples may be collected.
If BD sampling is frequent, consider acquiring a specialized sampling device. Such a sampler typically has a weight for hammering, which is guided by a handle for ease of use. The base diameter should be adapted to fit standard core rings, with a ~1 cm edge at the lower part of the cylinder to facilitate sample collection without compaction.

The base diameter should be adapted to fit standard core rings, with a ~1 cm edge at the lower part of the cylinder to facilitate sample collection without compaction.
Carefully collect soil clods from a soil profile. If roots are present, cut them carefully with scissors.
Tie the clod with fine copper wire and weigh it.
Dip the clod in melted wax and hang it to dry for 30 minutes. Additional coatings of melted wax may be applied to enhance waterproofing.
Weigh the coated clod and wire in air (Wta).
To determine the volume of the clod, weigh it while suspended in water using a balance that accommodates the clod hanging by the thin copper wire (Wtw). The difference in weight (Wta – Wtw) corresponds to the weight of water displaced, which equals the volume of the clod.
If such a balance is unavailable, immerse the clod completely in a graduated cylinder filled halfway with water, and measure the change in water volume in the cylinder (V).
For a separate sample, determine the moisture content of the soil and calculate the oven-dry weight (Wt). Alternatively, break the clod and take a sample to assess soil moisture content.
Wt: Weight of oven-dry solid particles in the clod (g).
Wta – Wtw: Weight of the water displaced by the clod (g) or volume of the clod (cm³).
V: Change in volume of water in the graduated cylinder (cm³).
The clod method may yield higher bulk density (BD) values compared to other methods.
ratio of 1:7. As acetone is flammable, this mixture should be prepared in a fume hood and stored in a tightly closed container to prevent volatilization.
The difference between the weight of the paraffin-coated clod in air and its weight in water gives the weight of water displaced by the clod, assuming water's density is 1 g/cm³ (actual value is 0.9982 g/cm³ at 20 °C). Thus, the weight of water displaced in grams equals the volume of the clod and paraffin in cm³.
To find the volume of the clod alone, subtract the volume of the paraffin, calculated from its weight and density (0.80 g/cm³).
The bulk density (BD) is determined by dividing the oven-dry weight of the soil by its bulk volume.
Melted wax (paraffin wax) can be used as a replacement for dissolved saran resin.
Remove any loose material from the surface, such as the O horizon or other surface materials. When sampling subsurface horizons, dig a large pit to the required depth.
Create a flat, horizontal area slightly larger than the metal ring (cylinder).
Carefully drive the cylinder (known volume) into the soil using a block of wood and a hammer, taking care to avoid soil compaction during core collection. After careful removal of the soil core, examine it and trim the ends.
Weigh the soil and cylinder together (Wtsc).
Calculate the weight of the soil sample alone by subtracting the weight of the cylinder.
Take a portion of this soil for moisture determination and calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil in the sample.
Calculate the bulk density (BD) in g/cm³.
Wtsc: Weight of oven-dry soil core (g).
V: Volume of the soil core (cm³).
The BD value of undisturbed cores is of practical significance, as it indicates soil aggregation and structure under field conditions.
Weigh 40 g of oven-dry soil (Wts) in a 100-mL graduated cylinder.
Add 50 mL of water to the soil in the cylinder, ensuring no soil material adheres to the inner walls of the cylinder.
Stir thoroughly with a stirring rod to displace any trapped air, rinsing the rod and the inner walls of the cylinder with 10 mL of water.
Allow the mixture to stand for 5 minutes and then record the volume of the soil plus the 50 mL of water.
In a separate sample, determine the moisture content of the soil and calculate the oven-dry weight of the soil.
Add the moisture content to the amount of added water to find the total water used.
Calculate particle density (PD) in g/cm³.
Weigh a clean and dry pycnometer flask including the stopper in air (WtP).
Weigh approximately 10 g of air-dry soil (2-mm) into the pycnometer.
Note: Ensure the pycnometer is free of any soil that may have spilled on the outside and neck.
Weigh the pycnometer, including the stopper and soil sample (WtP+S).
In a separate sample, determine the gravimetric water content of the soil and calculate the weight of the oven-dry soil from the duplicate sample (Өm).
Fill the pycnometer about halfway with deionized (DI) water (boiled and cooled to room temperature), rinsing any soil from the inside of the neck.
Remove trapped air by gently boiling the water on a hot plate, agitating frequently to prevent soil loss due to foaming (boil until no air bubbles are visible).
Cool the pycnometer and its contents to room temperature in a vacuum desiccator.
Add enough DI water at room temperature to fill the pycnometer.
Insert the stopper and seat it carefully. Dry the outside of the flask with a cloth, taking care not to draw water out of the capillary.
Weigh the pycnometer and its contents (WtP+S+W).
Remove the soil from the pycnometer and wash it thoroughly.
Fill the pycnometer with DI water at room temperature, insert the stopper, remove excess water, and weigh the pycnometer, stopper, and water (WtP+W).
Correct the weight of the soil sample to oven-dry.
Fill a pre-weighed volumetric flask to the mark with boiled DI water (cooled to room temperature).
Weigh the flask plus water (Wt1), then discard the water and dry the flask thoroughly.
Accurately weigh 50 g of air-dry soil (2-mm) (Wt).
Transfer the soil quantitatively to the volumetric flask, ensuring no soil spills during transfer.
Add 50 mL of boiled and cooled DI water into the flask, rinsing any soil particles from the neck.
Heat the flask gently on a hot plate until the water begins to boil, driving out air from the soil.
Cool the contents and bring them up to the 100-mL mark with DI water.
Weigh the volumetric flask with its contents (Wt2).
10. Calculate the volume of soil particles and then the Particle Density (PD).
The total pore space (TPS) consists of the pore spaces between adjacent sand, silt, and clay particles, as well as those between aggregates. Percent pore space (PS) is the ratio of the volume of voids in soil to the total volume (bulk volume) of the soil, multiplied by 100. Texture and structure are the primary factors governing the amount of PS in soil. Organic matter (OM) affects pore space indirectly by improving structure. An increase in soil aggregation leads to an increase in TPS, resulting in a decrease in the weight per unit volume, or Bulk Density (BD), of the soil. A medium-textured mineral soil in good structural condition for plant growth has a PS of about 50%. This PS is crucial for gas exchange (O₂ and CO₂) between the soil and atmosphere, as well as for water storage and movement. The PS is filled with air and water and can be categorized into macro-pores (large) and micro-pores (small), although there is no sharp distinction between the two.
h is the soil water pressure head (cm). The soil water pressure head is zero when the soil is fully saturated (no air in the pores). The Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) is approximately -15,000 cm (pF = 4.2), and field capacity (FC) ranges from -100 cm (pF = 2) to -500 cm (pF = 2.69), depending on soil texture. Water exists in soil under tensions ranging from pF = 0 (no tension) to pF = 7.0 (high tension). A positive tension value indicates that water is ponded on the soil surface.
The figure illustrates the pF-curve for three soils with different textures. The FC is the point where water is retained in the soil after excess water has drained due to gravity, while the PWP represents the force at which water cannot be removed by typical crops. In air-dry soil, water is held with a tension of pF 6.0 to 7.0.
The Available Water Capacity (AWC), or Plant-Available Water (PAW), is the amount of water retained in the soil that can be extracted by plants. It is estimated as the difference in soil water content between FC and PWP. Soil moisture characteristics are utilized to determine: 1) the water readily absorbed by plant roots (for irrigation), 2) effective pore space and porosity, 3) specific yield (for drainage design), and 4) changes in soil structure (caused by tillage or mixing of soil layers). The relationship between soil moisture tension and other soil physical properties, such as capillary conductivity, thermal conductivity, and clay/OM content, is often the subject of research.
Soak the pressure plates thoroughly in deionized (DI) water overnight prior to use.
Place the pressure plates on a workbench.
Arrange labeled rubber rings on the plate (each plate accommodates 12 samples).
Fill each ring with air-dried soil (2 mm) using a spatula (approximately 20 g per sample). To avoid particle-size segregation, place the entire soil sample into the ring, then level it without packing.
Add water between the rings until there is an excess (at least 3 mm deep) on the plate.
Cover the plate and samples with a plastic sheet.
Allow samples to stand overnight.
The next morning, remove excess water from the plate using a tool (e.g., syringe, disposable pipette, or siphon).
Place the triangular support in the extractor vessel at the bottom.
Install the plate with samples in the lowest position of the extractor, then install the middle and top plates (place plastic disks between the plates).
Close the extractor and tighten it, ensuring that the “O” ring is in place and all nuts are uniformly tightened. Apply the desired pressure in the 0-100 kPa (0-1 bar) range, building the pressure in the vessel gradually.
Place a beaker to collect water from the outflow tubes.
Maintain pressure until no more water is being released (generally 18-20 hours, but some soils may take 48 hours or longer).
Release pressure from the extractor (remove outflow tubes from water before turning the instrument off).
Without undue delay, transfer the moist soil sample from the ring using a wide-bladed spatula to a tared dish (a quantitative transfer of the entire soil sample is not necessary).
Immediately weigh the wet sample (accuracy of 0.01 g) and place it in a drying oven at 105 °C for 24 hours.
Place samples in a desiccator, cool, and weigh.
Use 15-bar ceramic plates and follow Steps 1-14 of the previous method, applying 1-15 bar pressure (100-1500 kPa).
Samples should remain in the extractor until flow has ceased from all samples on the plate and the soils have reached equilibrium (24–48 hours for most soils; however, some fine-textured and organic soils may require up to 120 hours). Stop the water outflow from the extractor to indicate that equilibrium has been attained.
Follow Steps 17–20 of the previous method.
Install the pressure plate to be used in a pressure cooker. Fill the cooker with water, fasten the lid, and measure the rate of outflow of water from the ceramic plates at a pressure of 15 bar; the rate should be about 1 mL per cm²/h/atm.
To check the integrity of the ceramic plate, introduce free air pressure inside the ceramic pressure plate, close the outflow valve with your finger, then submerge the ceramic pressure plate in a tank of water. If there are air leaks at the gasket or connections, the ceramic pressure plate should be replaced.
If the outlets of the plates continue to bubble after a few hours of applied pressure, it indicates a potential issue.
Feel free to ask if you need any further adjustments!
Pressure must remain stable during a run, checked every 2-3 hours and adjusted if necessary. If fluctuations are within the regulator's specified tolerance, no adjustment is required.
Equilibrium during an experimental run is achieved when water flow from the outflow tube stops. At equilibrium, there is a direct relationship between air pressure in the extractor and soil suction (and moisture content) in the samples. The accuracy of these values depends on the regulation of the air supply, hence the pressure control panel features independent double regulators.
The sample height in the ring should be minimized to reduce the time needed to reach equilibrium, which is proportional to the square of the sample height.
Never remove the extractor lid while pressure remains in the container.
Pascal is the standard unit for soil suction; 100 kPa equals 1 bar or 0.987 atmospheres or 14.5 psi. The latter units are outdated.
Pressure plate cells are unsuitable for extracting soil solutions for chemical analysis due to the extensive surface area of the porous ceramic plate, which can disturb and contaminate the solution.
Pressure plates are cleaned and dried with a sand coating to prevent airborne particles from clogging the ceramic pores. Once dry, the sand can be brushed off before storage.
Sandbox Method: The sandbox applies suction from pF 0 (saturation) to pF 2.0 (-100 hPa). Sand conveys suction from the drainage system to soil samples, providing better contact than a rigid porous plate. Measurements correspond to points on the drying curves associated with decreasing pressure, typically using standard water potential increments. The wetting curve is graphed against increasing pressure values and differs from the drying curve due to the delayed response of water content to pressure changes, a phenomenon known as hysteresis.
Collect soil samples by pressing a metal ring into moist bulk soil until level with the surface. Remove excess soil carefully to avoid smearing, which could affect physical properties, and prevent excessive compaction or fragmentation.
Cap the core sample ring from both sides.
Record sample information (depth and profile), label inside the bag, and tie another label to the bag before transporting samples to the preparation laboratory.
Assign a laboratory number to each core ring.
Uncap the core sample ring and attach a nylon cloth to the bottom with an elastic band or O-ring.
Ensure a 0.5 cm layer of water covers the sand surface in the sandbox.
To saturate the sample, slowly raise the water level to 1 cm below the top of the sample ring.
Place a lid on the basin to prevent evaporation and allow the sample to saturate for 2 days (for sandy soils) or up to 1 week (for clayey soils).
Mark the rings and draw a sketch of the box, so that the rings can be replaced in exactly the same position after removal.
Carefully take the ring out of the water basin and wipe off any water drops hanging underneath the sample before weighing it. Weigh the core soil sample with an accuracy of 0.01 g. This weight (including the ring, cloth, and elastic) is used to calculate the water content at saturation, pF 0 (weight A).
It is difficult to transfer the saturated sample to a balance without changing water content, especially with sandy samples.
The middle of the soil sample is used as the reference level for zero pressure, but the free water level (h = 0) is actually 1 cm below the top of the sample ring. The moisture tension thus ranges from +1 cm at the bottom of the sample to -4 cm at the top of the sample. Note that at lower pressures, this difference due to sample size becomes less significant.
Place the sample back in its previous position in the sandbox. Press the ring slightly to improve soil-sand contact.
Apply a suction of -2.5 cm (equivalent to -2.5 hPa or 0.25 kPa) to the center of the samples.
Leave the sample to equilibrate (with the lid on the box to prevent evaporation). This will take a few days for sandy soil and up to a week for clayey soils.
Gently remove the samples and weigh them.
To check for equilibrium, place the sample back into the sandbox (ensuring that the contact between sand and sample is restored) and weigh the sample again the next day. If equilibrium has been reached with the created tension, the difference in water content will not exceed 0.002 in volume fraction.
If equilibrium between soil moisture content and pressure has been established, record the weight of the sample.
Moisten the sand surface with a wet sponge. Do not remove the filter cloth; simply clean and smooth it to remove air bubbles and impressions.
Place the soil samples on the sand in exactly the same position as they were previously—use the sketch made earlier.
Apply the next suction level and repeat the above steps.
Since the volume of the soil is known (equal to the volume of the metal ring used), the above calculation can be adapted to calculate volumetric moisture content (g water/cm³ soil).
The following figure illustrates an example of a soil water retention curve obtained with the sandbox method (ZT = zero-tillage, CT = conventional tillage; soil is a heavy clay).
Due to the significant influences of both pore size distribution and soil structure on moisture retention, especially at high matrix potentials, care should be taken not to disturb the original setting of the soil and to completely fill the ring when pressing the core rings into the soil.
Sampling conditions are optimal when the soil is approximately at field capacity.
Do not freeze the samples, as soil structure will be affected.
The laboratory should maintain a constant temperature between measurements, as temperature changes affect water viscosity and, consequently, water retention values.
If the soil volume is less than the volume of the ring or if the sample has been damaged during transport, the sample should not be used for analysis. Additionally, samples with large projecting stones may need to be discarded.
Rapidly raising the water levels in the sandbox (as described in step 5) will trap air and may damage the soil structure.
Add 0.01 mg/L copper sulfate to the water used in the sandbox to eliminate microbiological activity.
Major Non-mineral Macronutrients: These constitute 90–95% of dry plant weight and are supplied to the plant through water absorption and photosynthesis. The major non-mineral macronutrients are carbon (C), hydrogen (H), and oxygen (O).
Primary Macronutrients: These include nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K).
Secondary Macronutrients: These consist of calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S).
Micronutrients: This group includes boron (B), chloride (Cl), cobalt (Co), copper (Cu), iron (Fe), manganese (Mn), molybdenum (Mo), nickel (Ni), and zinc (Zn).
The amount of available nutrients in the soil.
The soil's ability to supply these nutrients to plants.
Environmental factors that affect nutrient availability and plant absorption.
Chemical measurements involve characterizing the soil solution and its constituents, as well as the composition of inorganic and organic phases in the soil. This section forms the core of this manual, covering all nutrient elements and soil components that directly or indirectly influence these elements.
The chemical procedures outlined here are comprehensive but not exhaustive. Numerous procedures or variations can be found in the literature (Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Page, 1982; Westerman, 1990; Sparks et al., 1996). We have selected procedures that are appropriate for soils of the Mediterranean region, where a good correlation exists between test values and crop growth. For alternative methods, we have highlighted their key features. A bibliography of soil testing information is included for users who may wish to expand or modify their soil testing procedures.
We initially present analyses that are routinely performed to characterize a soil sample or type, including background information such as pH, salinity, calcium carbonate (CaCO3), organic matter (OM), cation exchange capacity (CEC), and gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O). Regarding nitrogen, the dominant fertility factor in soils, we discuss the most convenient methods for measuring various forms or fractions of nitrogen. This is followed by procedures for phosphorus, soluble and exchangeable cations, soluble anions, and micronutrients. Guidelines for interpreting the data produced from the analytical procedures are provided where appropriate (see Appendix 9).
Using an extract from a saturated paste is beneficial for characterizing saline soils, as it closely approximates salinity related to plant growth. This method allows for the extraction of soluble cations and anions and the estimation of other important parameters, such as Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), which predicts Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP). Criteria for boron (B) toxicity tolerance by various plant species have also been developed using such extracts (see Appendix 15). Therefore, a saturation extract is routinely utilized where salinity is a concern. The cations analyzed in saturation extracts include calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na), while the anions comprise sulfate (SO4), carbonate (CO3), bicarbonate (HCO3), and chloride (Cl). Boron in saturation extracts is often measured when its toxicity is a concern.
Materials Needed: Spatulas or mixing spoons, vacuum filtration system.
Weigh 200-300 g of air-dry soil (sieved to < 2 mm) into a porcelain dish.
Gradually add deionized (DI) water, mixing with a spatula until the soil forms a paste.
The paste slides freely and cleanly off a spatula (this does not apply to clay soils with more than 40% clay).
It flows slightly when the container is tipped at a 45° angle from horizontal.
The soil surface glistens as it reflects light.
It consolidates easily by tapping after a trench is formed in the paste with the flat side of a spatula (this does not apply to sandy soils with more than 70% sand).
Allow the paste to stand for 1 hour, and then re-check the criteria for saturation by adding more deionized (DI) water or soil, as needed.
Leave the paste for 6 to 16 hours and then filter it using a vacuum filtration system with a Buchner funnel fitted with Whatman No. 42 filter paper.
Collect the filtrate in a small bottle for subsequent measurements. If the initial filtrate is turbid, re-filter it.
Do not stir the soil until the entire mass is wet.
After the initial wetting, the paste usually stiffens and loses its shine while standing. Adding water and re-mixing yields a mixture that retains the characteristics of a saturated paste.
Gypsum soil samples should not be oven-dried above 70°C prior to extracting soluble salts, as heating to 105°C partially converts gypsum (CaSO4·2H2O) to partially hydrated gypsum (CaSO4·½H2O), which is more soluble in water than fully hydrated gypsum.
For organic and peat soils with more than 16% organic matter (OM), it is advisable to start with 150 mL of water, slowly adding soil material. Soak overnight to achieve a definite endpoint for the saturated paste. Some high organic matter soils swell considerably when water is added; in such cases, the method must be repeated until the saturated paste characteristics stabilize.
Fine-textured soils (more than 40% clay) may puddle easily. To minimize puddling and achieve a more definite endpoint for the saturated paste, water should be added with minimal stirring, especially during the early stages of wetting. The method must be repeated until the saturated paste characteristics are stable.
Some soil types, such as coarse-textured soils, sandy loam, and loamy sand with less than 15% clay, may not exhibit saturated paste characteristics like finer textured soils. Consequently, the relative accuracy of the method declines, which should be noted when making soil comparisons.
For salinity appraisal, the saturated paste can be extracted after 4 hours.
For sodic soil samples, it should stand for 16 hours or more.
For soluble boron (B), it should stand for 24 hours or more, as saturated paste equilibration is required.
For calcium carbonate (CaCO3), if precipitates are observed in the extract, dilute the paste extract 1:1 with DI water and note the dilution in subsequent analyses. The paste extract may be refrigerated (at 4°C) for storage (do not allow it to freeze) for more than 30 days by adding small quantities (2 mL) of toluene to minimize microbial activity.
Approximately one-quarter to one-third of the water added in making the saturated paste can be recovered as extract.
Because potassium chloride (KCl) from the pH electrode can contaminate the paste, it is recommended that a separate paste be made for electrical conductivity (EC) determination. If, however, there are not enough samples for two separate pastes, the same paste can be used for both analyses, ensuring that the pH electrode is not left in the paste unnecessarily.
Soil moisture, determined from a separate sample, is accounted for by adding it to the amount of water used in preparing the saturated paste. Report the saturation percentage (SP) to the nearest 0.1%. The SP is calculated by dividing the total amount of water added (mL) by the oven-dry weight of the soil (g) and multiplying by 100.
Weigh a 30-50 g sub-sample of the paste into a dried and weighed metal can with a lid.
Dry in an oven, with the lid unfitted, at 105°C for 4 hours.
Remove from the oven, fit the lid, and cool in a desiccator for at least 30 minutes.
Note: Oven-dry moisture values will be slightly higher than the direct method, as air-dry soil retains 3-5% moisture, depending on clay and salt content.
The soil moisture retention (SP) is directly related to the field moisture range (e.g., Permanent Wilting Point (PWP) is about one-fourth of SP, and Field Capacity (FC) is about one-half of SP).
For mineral soils, approximately twice the FC is generally the amount of water required to achieve SP.
For fine-textured soils and those high in sodium (Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR) > 10), the SP cannot be used to estimate FC and PWP values.
The significance of pH lies in its influence on the availability of soil nutrients, solubility of toxic nutrient elements, physical breakdown of root cells, and cation exchange capacity (CEC) in soils where colloids (clay/humus) are pH-dependent, as well as biological activity. At high pH values, the availability of phosphorus and most micronutrients (except boron and molybdenum) tends to decrease.
Acid soils are rare in semi-arid, dryland areas of the world; they typically occur in temperate and tropical regions with substantial rainfall. In contrast, soils in drier areas are generally alkaline (above pH 7.0) due to the presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO3), which will visibly effervesce (fizz) when 10% hydrochloric acid (HCl) is added dropwise. Most soils in the WANA region have pH values between 8.0 and 8.5. Calcareous soils with gypsum tend to have slightly lower pH values, while those with excess sodium exhibit pH values above 8.5 (sodic soils).
Weigh 50 g of air-dry soil (sieved to < 2 mm) into a 100-mL glass beaker.
Add 50 mL of deionized (DI) water using a graduated cylinder or 50-mL volumetric flask.
Mix well with a glass rod and allow the mixture to stand for 30 minutes.
Stir the suspension every 10 minutes during this period.
After 1 hour, stir the suspension again.
Calibrate the pH meter (refer to Box No. 3 for details).
Immerse the combined electrode in the suspension (about 3 cm deep) and take the reading after 30 seconds, noting one decimal place.
Remove the electrode from the suspension, rinse thoroughly with DI water in a separate beaker, and carefully dry excess water with a tissue.
Ensure that the combined electrode contains saturated KCl solution and some solid KCl.
) suspension. For special purposes, pH can be measured in a saturated soil paste or in more dilute suspensions. In some laboratories, pH is measured in a suspension of soil and 1 N KCl or 0.01 M CaCl2.
The main advantage of measuring soil pH in a salt solution is the reduced interference from suspension effects and variable salt contents, such as fertilizer residues.
Air-drying can cause changes in pH values (e.g., through the oxidation of sulfides). The determination of pH in field-moist samples presents two limitations: taking representative samples is difficult, and biological activity can affect pH during the storage of soils in their natural moisture state. Air-drying prevents the development of acidity during moist storage.
The presence of clay may slow the electrode response. To avoid this, thoroughly clean the electrode between samples. If the electrode response is slow, clean it by immersing it in a weak HCl solution overnight.
Suspended colloids influence pH through the junction potential effect. In the presence of negatively charged colloids (e.g., clay particles or organic matter), the pH measured in the suspension will usually be lower than the measurement in the supernatant liquid. This is known as the suspension effect. This effect is particularly pronounced in peat soils, where there is often little supernatant compared to soil sediment. In every sample, the electrode junction should be placed at the same distance above the soil surface to maintain uniformity in pH readings. The CO3 status of some soils can change over time; therefore, it is important to avoid undue delays in taking readings after introducing the electrode. The initial pH of a non-alkaline soil may be as much as 0.5 pH units higher than the reading taken after the sample has stood for 30 minutes or longer.
Soil salinity refers to the concentration of soluble inorganic salts in the soil. It is typically measured by extracting the soil sample with water (using a 1:1 or 1:5 soil-to-water ratio, w/v) or through a saturated paste extract. Soil-to-solution ratios of 1:1 or wider are more convenient when the quantity of soil is limited. Such extracts are rapid, and salinity is measured by electrical conductivity (EC) using a conductivity bridge. The total salt content of a soil can be estimated from this measurement. A more precise method involves evaporating the aqueous extract and weighing the residue (total dissolved solids, TDS).
Salinity is a crucial laboratory measurement since it reflects the extent to which the soil is suitable for growing crops. However, salinity affects plants at all stages of development, and sensitivity can vary from one growth stage to another for some crops. While salinity is primarily a concern in irrigated areas and regions with saline soils, it is often less important in rainfed agriculture. However, with the increasing use of irrigation, there will be greater emphasis on EC measurement in the future. The basic methodology and principles of EC measurement are detailed in USDA Handbook 60 (Richards, 1954).
Based on a saturation extract, values of 0 to 2 dS/m are safe for all crops; yields of very sensitive crops are affected between 2 and 4 dS/m; many crops are affected between 4 and 8 dS/m; while only tolerant crops grow reasonably well above that level (see Appendix 14).
A table is referenced in the context that details equipment and solutions needed for measuring electrical conductivity. It includes items like a conductivity bridge and a vacuum filtration system. Additionally, it describes the preparation of a potassium chloride (KCl) solution, outlining the steps to dry, dissolve, and prepare the solution that provides a specific electrical conductivity at a given temperature. The methodology for measuring electrical conductivity using soil samples is also summarized, indicating the quantities of soil and water to be used and the necessary mixing and waiting periods to ensure accurate readings.
Open the suction and add the suspension to the Buchner funnel.
Continue filtration until the soil in the Buchner funnel starts cracking. If the filtrate is not clear, repeat the procedure.
Calibrate the conductivity meter according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see Box No. 4 for more details).
Transfer the clear filtrate into a 50-mL bottle, immerse the conductivity cell in the solution, and take the reading.
Remove the conductivity cell from the solution, rinse it thoroughly with deionized (DI) water, and dry any excess water with a tissue.
Readings are recorded in deci-Siemens per meter (dS/m).
Exposure of the saturated soil sample or extracting solution to the atmosphere may cause changes in conductivity due to the loss or gain of dissolved gases, such as CO2 and NH3-N. Freshly distilled water has a conductivity of 0.005 - 0.002 dS/m, which can increase after a few weeks to 0.002 - 0.004 dS/m. This is particularly concerning for samples with very low electrical conductivity (ECe).
The electrical conductivity (EC) should be measured as soon as the extracts are prepared to avoid potential changes in ionic content due to microbial activity during storage at room temperature. If necessary, extracts can be stored for up to a week under refrigeration (4 °C) before measuring EC.
Inorganic carbonate, either as calcium (calcite) or magnesium (dolomite) carbonate, or mixtures of both, occurs in soils as a result of weathering or is inherited from the parent material. Most soils in arid and semi-arid regions are calcareous; in fact, soils from these regions may predominantly consist of CaCO3. The soil retention of nutrients like phosphorus (P), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) is directly related to carbonate content and the distribution of total and active CaCO3 between clay and silt fractions. Consequently, the CaCO3 equivalent is typically determined in most laboratories. While some labs also determine "active" CaCO3, this is less common than measuring "total" CaCO3, mainly in areas influenced by French methodologies, as it was developed by Drouineau (1942) in France. Active CaCO3 reflects the surface area or reactivity of CaCO3 particles, particularly in the clay-size fraction.
Active CaCO3 is usually related to total CaCO3 equivalent, being approximately 50% of the total value. Advocates claim that this fraction is more closely related to nutrient behavior, particularly in relation to iron (Fe) chlorosis. Some methods for determining CaCO3 in soils involve the collection of CO2 gas and the measurement of CO2 pressure that develops when acid is added to a calcareous soil in a closed flask.
The carbonate in the sample is dissolved in an excess of hydrochloric acid (HCl). The remaining acid is then titrated against sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A specific weight of soil is reacted with an excess of acid, releasing CO2 gas, and the unreacted acid is back-titrated with NaOH solution. In this titration method, two equivalents of acid are assumed to react with one mole of CaCO3, meaning one equivalent of acid corresponds to one-half mole of CaCO3.
Dilute 82.8 mL of concentrated HCl (37%, specific gravity 1.19) in DI water, mix well, let it cool, and adjust the volume to 1 L. Standardize with 1 N Na2CO3 solution to determine the exact normality of the HCl solution.
Dissolve 40 g of NaOH in DI water and transfer it to a 1-L flask, allowing it to cool and adjusting to the final volume. Standardize with 1 N HCl solution to determine the exact normality of the NaOH solution.
Dissolve 0.5 g of phenolphthalein indicator in 100 mL of ethanol (ethyl alcohol).
Dissolve 53 g of anhydrous Na₂CO₃ in deionized (DI) water and bring the total volume to 1 L. This solution should not be stored for longer than one week.
Weigh 1 g of air-dried soil (sieved to 0.15 mm) into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Using a volumetric pipette, add 10 mL of 1 N HCl solution to the flask.
Swirl the flask and leave it overnight, or heat to 50 – 60 °C, then allow it to cool.
Add 50 – 100 mL of DI water using a graduated cylinder, and then add 2 – 3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator.
Titrate with 1 N NaOH solution while swirling the flask. Continue the titration until a faint pink color develops, then record the reading as R.
0.05 is the equivalent weight of CaCO₃ (50/1000).
Accurate determination of the color change from colorless to pink requires some experience.
A 10 mL portion of 1 N HCl can dissolve up to 0.5 g of CaCO₃. If a soil contains 50% CaCO₃ or more, it may be necessary to add 15 or 20 mL.
When soil reacts with acid to dissolve carbonates, other components may also consume acid. Most of these reactions are assumed to be reversible; thus, if the suspension is back-titrated, the acid is released again. For this reason, it is not recommended to filter the suspension and titrate the clear filtrate. Although the color change is easier to determine in a clear solution, the titration value may overestimate the actual CaCO₃ content in the soil.
Not all reactions between acid and soil components are completely reversible, and therefore the acid titration of the soil suspension may also slightly overestimate the actual soil carbonate content. The acid titration method can be calibrated against the Calcimeter method.
The retention or precipitation of phosphorus (P), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) is often related to the total amount of carbonates.
After equilibration, the suspension is filtered, and the remaining oxalate is titrated with permanganate in an acid medium. Once all the oxalate is oxidized, the solution turns pink due to the permanganate.
Dissolve 12.61 g of ammonium oxalate in deionized (DI) water, and bring the total volume to 1 L.
Dissolve 3.16 g of KMnO₄ in approximately 600-800 mL of DI water (the DI water should be boiled and then cooled).
Maintain the solution at a gentle boil for about 1 hour, then cover and let it stand overnight.
Filter the solution and bring the total volume to 1 L. Store the solution in an amber glass bottle.
Dissolve 6.3 g of H₂C₂O₄ in 500 mL of DI water.
Dry about 8 g of Na₂C₂O₄ at 110 °C for at least 1 hour, then cool it in a desiccator.
Dissolve 6.7 g of the dried Na₂C₂O₄ in DI water and bring the total volume to 500 mL.
Weigh 1 g of air-dried soil (sieved to 0.15 mm) in a 500 mL beaker.
Add 100 mL of 0.2 N ammonium oxalate solution using a volumetric flask.
Shake on a mechanical (orbital) shaker for 2 hours at 250-300 revolutions per minute (rpm).
Filter the suspension using suction, discarding the first few milliliters.
Pipette 10 mL of the clear filtrate into a 500 mL Erlenmeyer flask. Add approximately 75 mL of DI water and 5 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄.
Heat the mixture to 60-70 °C on a hot plate.
Titrate the hot solution with the 0.04 N potassium permanganate solution until the pink color becomes stable for at least 1 minute (V_sample).

0.1 meq of MnO₄ reacts with 5 mg of CaCO₃.
This method should not be applied to soils that contain gypsum (CaSO₄·2H₂O) or are high in organic matter (OM).
The solution must be heated to 80–90 °C for a rapid reaction. The reaction is catalyzed by Mn produced and initially proceeds slowly until some Mn is formed. The first persistent pink color (lasting 30 seconds) should be taken as the endpoint. A blank should be determined by titrating an equal volume of 1 M H₂SO₄.
Precautions should be taken to ensure uniformity in sample handling and shaking procedures. Major sources of error include solution and exchangeable Ca, as well as the inability of oxalate to react with Mg in Mg-substituted calcite.
The maximum quantity of “active” CaCO₃ that can be dissolved by this procedure is 200 g/kg (20%) soil. If “active” CaCO₃ contents greater than about 150 g/kg (17%) are obtained, the analysis should be repeated with a smaller amount of soil and/or a larger volume of ammonium oxalate.
Most laboratories in the region perform analyses for Soil Organic Matter (SOM), which can be measured by several methods. These include the loss after ignition method, which involves weight change due to the destruction of organic compounds by H₂O₂ treatment or by ignition at high temperatures. Another method is wet combustion analysis of soils using chromic acid digestion, which is the standard procedure for determining total carbon (C). Organic matter or organic carbon can also be estimated using volumetric and colorimetric methods. However, the most common procedure involves the reduction of potassium dichromate (K₂Cr₂O₇) by organic carbon compounds, followed by the determination of the unreduced dichromate through oxidation-reduction titration with ferrous ammonium sulfate. This method is known as the Walkley-Black method (Walkley, 1947; FAO, 1974).
While the actual measurement is of oxidizable organic carbon, the data are typically converted to a percentage of organic matter using a constant factor, assuming that organic matter contains 58% organic carbon. However, since this proportion is not constant, we prefer to report results as oxidizable organic carbon, or as organic carbon multiplied by 1.33.
Dry K₂Cr₂O₇ in an oven at 105 °C for 2 hours. Cool in a desiccator (with silica gel), and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.

Dissolve 1 g of diphenylamine indicator in 100 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄.
Weigh 1 g of air-dried soil (0.15 mm) into a 500-mL beaker.

×100, where 3 is the equivalent weight of carbon.
The conversion factor for organic carbon to total organic matter for surface soils varies from 1.7 to 2.0. In the soils of arid and semi-arid regions, a value of 1.724 (equal to 1/0.58) is commonly used. The factors 1.334 and 1.724 used to calculate total organic carbon (TOC) and organic matter (OM) are approximate and may vary with soil depth and among different soils.
For soils with high organic matter (1% oxidizable OM or more), more than 10 mL of potassium dichromate may be required.
Soils containing large quantities of chloride (Cl), manganese (Mn), and ferrous (Fe) ions may yield higher results. The chloride interference can be eliminated by adding silver sulfate (Ag₂SO₄) to the oxidizing reagent. No known procedure currently exists to compensate for the other interferences.
The presence of calcium carbonate (CaCO₃) up to 50% of the sample weight does not cause any interferences.
Air-dried soils seldom contain sufficient amounts of Fe (II) to cause interference. Water-logged soils often contain large quantities of Fe (II), but in most cases, this can be oxidized by drying the soil samples prior to analysis.
Chloride is oxidized to chromyl chloride, which is volatilized, resulting in high organic matter (OM) values. If high amounts of Cl are present in the sample, add 15 g of Ag₂SO₄ to 1 L of H₂SO₄.
Sulfuric acid readily absorbs water; therefore, use a fresh reagent.
Elemental carbon (e.g., charcoal) is not attacked by the dichromate solution in this method.
Grinding of the samples is required only to reduce sub-sampling error. It is generally not necessary to pass the ground sample through a sieve (if required, use a non-ferrous sieve).
The Particulate Organic Matter (POM) fraction is a relatively labile, sand-sized fraction. It acts as a micro-aggregate binding agent and is a sensitive indicator of management practices.

Wash all the suspension in the beaker through a 53-µm sieve with plenty of DI water into another pre-weighed and dried beaker (600 mL), until the water runs clear. This suspension is now called mineral-associated organic matter (MOM), with a particle size < 53 µm.
Wash all the retained material in the sieve into another pre-weighed and dried beaker (600 mL). This suspension is now called particulate organic matter (POM), with a particle size > 53 µm.
Dry the beakers in an oven at 45 °C overnight.
Remove the beakers from the oven; cool them in a desiccator for at least 30 minutes and reweigh them to determine the MOM and POM fractions.
Determine the organic matter content of the MOM and POM using the OM method.
Many minerals in soils are negatively charged and can attract and retain cations such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and ammonium (NH₄). Cation exchange is a reversible process, allowing nutrients to be held in the soil and not lost through leaching, with the potential for subsequent release for crop uptake. Certain organic compounds contribute to cation exchange capacity (CEC). The presence of high concentrations of Ca, especially in the form of gypsum, can interfere with the determination of CEC, which is crucial for soil fertility and mineralogical characterization. Additionally, CEC is influenced by soil pH. A certain portion of the total negative charge is permanent, while a variable portion is pH-dependent.
Several methods are available for CEC determination (Rhoades, 1982). Most methods involve saturating the soil with an index cation (NH₄), washing away the excess cation, and subsequently replacing the adsorbed index cation with another cation (Na) and measuring the index cation in the final extract (Richards, 1954). Modified procedures have been introduced due to the high solubility of Ca in calcareous and gypsiferous soils (FAO, 1990; Rhoades and Polemio, 1977).
Cation exchange capacity is reported as centimoles per kilogram of soil.

Prepare a series of standard solutions from the Stock Solution by diluting 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 mL of the Stock Solution to 100 mL in a numbered flask with 1 N ammonium acetate solution, and add 25 mL of LiCl (Diluted Stock Solution). Bring to volume. These solutions will contain 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150, and 200 ppm Na, with each containing the same concentration of LiCl (25 ppm).

Calculate the Na concentration according to the calibration curve.
Although laborious, the method of Rhoades and Polemio (1977) is more appropriate for soils containing carbonates, gypsum, and zeolite.
The cation exchange capacity (CEC) of clay minerals is pH-dependent.
Kaolinite clay minerals have a low CEC.
Montmorillonitic clay minerals exhibit a high CEC due to negative charges developed through cation loss during their formation.
Organic matter has a large CEC, but this is also pH-dependent.
Practices such as fertilization, liming, irrigation, and addition of organic manures can increase CEC.
Soils with variable gypsum content (CaSO₄·2H₂O) are common in many countries of the WANA region.

Sodium and potassium sulfate (K2SO4), when present in sufficiently high concentrations, can also be precipitated by acetone. The maximum tolerable concentrations of sodium sulfate (NaSO4) and K are 50 and 10 meq/L, respectively.
) extract, the determination should be repeated using a diluted extract.
A qualitative test for gypsum should be routinely conducted on all soils to save time later when analyzing for gypsum. Pipette 5 mL of the soil extract into a small centrifuge tube and add 5 mL of acetone. Mix well and allow to stand for 10 minutes. If a flocculated white precipitate forms, the soil contains gypsum; if no precipitate forms, the soil is considered to be free of gypsum.
In light of the high nitrogen (N) requirements of crops and the low levels of available N in many soils, nitrogen is the most important nutrient in agriculture. Monitoring N fertilizer dynamics in soils is crucial from an environmental perspective, as nitrate is one of the major pollutants of groundwater, river water, and lakes. Nitrogen in soils exists in many forms, either organic or inorganic. With increasing aridity, both organic and total soil nitrogen tend to decrease.
The organic fraction constitutes the majority of total nitrogen in soils (usually >95%). It is composed mainly of plant and microbial remains, varying in composition. The inorganic phase of soil nitrogen comprises ammonium (NH4), nitrate (NO3), and, to a lesser extent, nitrite (NO2) forms.
Total soil nitrogen (primarily organic) is generally measured after wet digestion using the well-known Kjeldahl procedure. Total inorganic nitrogen (NH₄⁺, NO₃⁻, NO₂⁻) is typically determined by distillation of a 2 M KCl soil extract. Following distillation, nitrate nitrogen (NO₃-N) can be assessed using a procedure involving chromotropic acid.
This procedure encompasses both digestion and distillation. The soil sample is digested in concentrated H₂SO₄ with a catalyst mixture to increase the boiling temperature and facilitate the conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonium nitrogen (NH₄-N). The NH₄-N from the digest is extracted through steam distillation, utilizing excess sodium hydroxide (NaOH) to raise the pH. The distillate is then collected in a saturated boric acid (H₃BO₃) solution and titrated with dilute sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) to a pH of 5.0. This method measures ammonium nitrogen, most forms of organic nitrogen, and a variable fraction of nitrate nitrogen in the soil. For most soils, the Kjeldahl procedure provides a reliable estimate of total soil nitrogen content. If necessary, nitrate nitrogen can be included via reduced iron or salicylic acid modifications of the Kjeldahl method (see the following section).

Weigh 1 g of air-dried soil (0.15 mm) into a 100-mL calibrated digestion tube.
Add approximately 5.0-5.5 g of the catalyst mixture, a few pumice boiling granules, and 15 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ (performing this in a fume hood), then swirl carefully. Place a glass funnel in the neck of the tube, set the tubes in a rack, and leave overnight.
Insert the rack of tubes into the block digester and gradually increase the temperature to about 370 °C. The H₂SO₄ should condense about halfway up the tube neck; once the solution clears, continue heating for an additional 3 hours.
Remove the tube rack from the block digester, carefully place it on a holder, and allow the tubes to cool to room temperature.
Slowly add about 15 mL of DI water to the tubes, cool, and bring to volume. If the contents solidify and do not dissolve, reheat the tubes until the precipitate (gypsum) dissolves, then cool with tap water.
Each batch of samples for digestion should include at least one reagent blank (no soil) and one chemical standard (no soil, with 1 mL of the stock solution).
2. Calibration and Standardization Calibrate the pH meter using buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (for buffer) and pH 4.0 (for sensitivity) after adjusting for temperature. Then, standardize the 0.01 N H₂SO₄ in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to a pH of 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not, continue titrating additional aliquots until agreement is achieved. The normality of the H₂SO₄ solution is then determined.
Dispense 1 mL of saturated H₃BO₃ solution and 1 mL of deionized (DI) water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placing it under the condenser tip so that the tip touches the solution surface.
Pipette a 10-mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask, and add 10 mL of 10 N NaOH solution.
Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start the distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lowering the dish to allow the distillate to drain freely into it.
After 4 minutes, when approximately 35 mL of distillate has been collected, turn off the steam supply and wash the tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.
Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 using standardized 0.01 N H₂SO₄ with the Auto-Titrator.
Each distillation should include at least two standards and two reagent blanks. Recovery of NH₄-N should be at least 96%.
After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish.
Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off the cooling water supply (draining the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds.
The block digester may be insulated with an asbestos shield to achieve a more uniform temperature distribution.
Add 3 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ to DI water in the heating mantle's flask to trap any NH₃ present, and include Teflon boiling chips for smooth boiling.
The precision of the method relies on the complete conversion of organic nitrogen into NH₄-N, the digestion temperature and time, solid-to-acid ratio, and the catalyst used.
The optimal temperature for digestion is between 320-370 °C. At lower temperatures, digestion may be incomplete, while at temperatures above 410 °C, NH₃ loss may occur.
Catalysts such as a mixture of CuSO₄ or selenium are used to accelerate the digestion process. Potassium sulfate is added to raise the boiling point of the acid to prevent acid loss by volatilization.
Inspect all joints of the Kjeldahl apparatus to prevent leaks and NH₃ loss.
Do not wash hot Kjeldahl flasks immediately with cold water or allow them to cool for too long, as this may cause deposits that are difficult to remove.
If frothing occurs and passes through to the boric acid, discard the sample and perform a fresh distillation.
Opening NH₃ bottles in the laboratory should be strictly prohibited during distillation. Titrations should be conducted in an NH₄-free atmosphere.
If titration is delayed, store the distillate in NH₄-free cabinets after tightly stoppering the flasks.

Allow the mixture to stand for 15 minutes, then swirl well. Avoid swirling immediately after adding acid to prevent excessive frothing.
Add 2 drops of the N-octyl alcohol solution.
Introduce a few pumice boiling granules to the blank, EDTA, and sample digest tubes.
Add 2.5 g of reduced iron using a long-stem funnel and immediately place a 5-cm (ID) glass funnel (without the stem) in the tube neck, then swirl.
If excessive frothing occurs, pour 5 mL of DI water through the 5-cm glass funnel without swirling.
Allow the tubes to stand overnight.
Pre-digest the samples by placing them on a cold block and heating at 100 °C for 1 hour. The block digester will reach 100 °C within 15 minutes, so the total time on the block digester will be approximately 1 hour and 15 minutes.
Remove the tubes from the block digester and allow them to cool. Rapid cooling can be achieved using tap water.
Add approximately 5 g of the catalyst mixture through a long-stem funnel. Then, add 25 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ to each tube and swirl. Note that more acid may be required if a larger amount of soil is used.
Place the tubes back in the block digester, pre-heated to 100 °C. Increase the block temperature setting to 240 °C and remove the funnels.
Arrange the funnels systematically so they can be placed back into the same digestion tube later. It takes about 40 minutes to reach 240 °C.
Continue boiling off the water for 1 hour after the temperature reaches 240 °C.
After removing the water, replace the funnels and raise the temperature to 380 °C.
Set the timer on the block digester and digest at this temperature for 4 hours.
Remove the tubes from the block digester, add about 50 mL of deionized (DI) water, and mix using a vortex mixer. If any solid precipitate remains in the tubes, break it up with a glass rod.
After cooling, add DI water to bring the total volume to the 250-mL mark.
Before starting a batch for distillation, steam out the distillation unit for at least 10 minutes. Adjust the steam rate to achieve a distillate output of 7–8 mL per minute. Ensure that water flows through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep the distillate temperature below 22 °C.
Calibrate the pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer) and 4.0 (sensitivity) after setting it for temperature. Standardize the 0.01 N H₂SO₄ in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0.

Pipette 50 mL of soil digestion into a 250-mL distillation flask, carefully adding 25 mL of 10 N NaOH down the side of the flask while holding it at a 50° angle.
Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start the distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lowering the dish to allow the distillate to drain freely.
After 4 minutes, when 35 mL of distillate has been collected, turn off the steam supply and wash the tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.
Note that the first appearance of distillate may be delayed when larger aliquots are used. The distillation time should always be 4 minutes from the first appearance of distillate flow.
Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H₂SO₄ using the Auto-Titrator.
Each distillation should include at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks). Recovery of NH₄-N should be at least 96%.
After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode into the dish.
Between different samples, steam out the distillation setup. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the distillation unit, and place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip. Turn off the cooling water supply (draining the water from the condenser jacket) and steam out for 90 seconds.
Nitrogen is absorbed by plant roots in two forms: ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N). Ammonium ions are produced in soils through the breakdown of organic matter (OM), manures, urea, or ammonium-containing fertilizers. Nitrate ions are the final form of nitrogen breakdown and reactions (excluding gaseous forms of nitrogen). They can also be supplied to the soil through fertilizers.
Nitrogen can be lost from the soil in several ways, including volatilization, anaerobic denitrification, and leaching. Normally, ammonium does not leach from the soil because its positive charge is attracted to and “held” by the negative charges present on the surfaces of clay and humus particles. However, when ammonium is transformed into nitrate, it loses its positive charge, and the soil no longer retains the available nitrogen unless positive charges are present (anion exchange capacity). Water percolating through the soil profile may leach and deplete mobile nitrate from the upper layers to the lower layers and even into the groundwater if leaching is excessive. Such excessive nitrate leaching is often a consequence of inadequate nitrogen fertilizer management.
Nitrate is highly soluble in water, and various solutions, including water, have been used as extractants. Exchangeable ammonium can be extracted at room temperature with a neutral potassium salt solution. Various extractants at different molarities have been employed, such as 0.05 M K2SO4, 0.1 M KCl, 1 M KCl, and 2 M KCl.
) ratio. Ammonium and nitrate, plus nitrite (NO2), are quantified through steam distillation of ammonia (NH3), utilizing heavy magnesium oxide (MgO) for ammonium and Devarda’s alloy for nitrate. The distillate is collected in saturated boric acid (H3BO3) and titrated to pH 5.0 with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This method determines dissolved and adsorbed forms of ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite in soils. The sum determined by this method is referred to as mineral nitrogen.
Field-fresh soil samples are preferred over air-dried or oven-dried samples, as the drying process may alter the concentrations of ammonium and nitrate. Soil samples may be stored in a refrigerator for a few days until analysis.

Filter the NO3-N suspensions using Whatman No. 42 filter paper, and allow the NH4-N suspension to settle for at least 1 hour until the soil precipitates.
Before starting a distillation batch, steam out the distillation unit for at least 10 minutes. Adjust the steam rate to 7–8 mL of distillate per minute, ensuring that water flows through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep the distillate temperature below 22 °C.
Calibrate the pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 and 4.0 (sensitivity), after setting for temperature. Standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0.

After 4 minutes, when 35 mL or more of distillate is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask.
Each distillation should include at least two standards (20 mL of 1.2 mg NH4-N from the Diluted Stock Solution) and two blanks (20 mL of 2 M KCl). Recovery of NH4-N should be at least 96%.
Pipette a 20-mL aliquot of the DI water soil extract into a 100-mL distillation flask.

Wash the tip of the condenser into the Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker with a small amount of DI water.
Each distillation should include at least two standards (20 mL of 1.2 mg NO3-N from the Diluted Stock Solution) and two blanks (20 mL of DI water). Recovery of NO3-N should be at least 96%.
Titrate both distillates separately to pH 5.0 using standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 with an Auto-Titrator. After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, burette tip, and combined electrode into the dish.
Attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp and start distilling. Proceed as for NH4-N.
Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the KCl extracts and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip. Turn off the cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket) and steam out for 90 seconds. Steaming out is performed only between different samples, not between NH4-N (determined by MgO) and NO3-N (by Devarda’s alloy) in the same sample.
) extract is used for Mineral-N determination. For soils in northwest Syria, a 1:5 extract provides a higher recovery of NH4-N than a 1:3 extract.
For determining NO3-N in calcareous soils, it is recommended to use deionized water as the extracting solution. Carbonates dissolve in the KCl solution, and some CO2 may be collected in the H3BO3 during distillation, causing negative interference with NO3-N determination in KCl extract.
There is often confusion regarding the relationship between NO3 and NO3-N. The nitrate ion consists of one N atom and three O atoms. The total mass of NO3 is 14 g + 48 g = 62 g. Therefore, 62 g of NO3 contains 14 g of N and 48 g of O. This relationship can be expressed in two ways: as 62 g of NO3 or as 14 g of NO3-N. Both expressions are correct. Since 62/14 = 4.43, one can convert NO3 measurements to actual N concentration. For example, 10 ppm NO3-N can be expressed as 10 × 4.43, which equals 44.3 ppm NO3. Both values represent the same concentration in two different formats.
Errors caused by NH4 and NO3 contamination from filter paper can be significant.
In samples low in NH4 and NO3 (such as those from deeper mineral soil horizons), the soil-to-solution ratio could be decreased to obtain detectable amounts of NH4 and NO3.
Nitrate-N is measured using a spectrophotometric method with chromotropic acid, which is rapid and was originally developed for water analysis but is now also used for soils. This method serves as an alternative to NO3-N determination by the distillation method. A strong correlation exists between NO3-N values obtained by chromotropic acid and the distillation method.

Microbial biomass is determined using the fumigation/incubation technique, which involves subjecting fresh soil to chloroform fumigation. This process lyses cell walls and denatures the cells, making their contents extractable in 0.5 M K₂SO₄. It’s important to note that this method does not measure soil microbial activity, as it does not differentiate between quiescent and active organisms or among different classes of microorganisms. Care should be taken when comparing soils from different locations, as microbial biomass can fluctuate significantly within a single soil based on litter inputs, moisture availability, and temperature. When comparing different agricultural soils at the same time, the fresh soils should be near their moisture holding capacity. For comparisons across different ecosystems, samples should be collected during the middle of the wet and dry seasons. The following procedure is based on Anderson and Ingram (1993) and adapted from Okalebo et al. (1993).
A. Chloroform Solution (CHCl₃): Wash chloroform with 5% concentrated H₂SO₄. In a separation funnel, separate the acid and rinse repeatedly (8 – 12 times) with deionized water. Store the washed chloroform in a dark bottle.

Determine the moisture content on soil sub-samples to express results on a dry-weight basis.
4. The second desiccator contains non-fumigated control samples, which, apart from fumigation-evacuation, should be handled in the same manner. Close the lids of the desiccators, ensuring that the sealant is uniformly distributed.
5. Apply vacuum to the fumigated treatment until the chloroform is boiling rapidly. Evacuate the fumigated treatments using a vacuum pump repeatedly (8 to 12 times).
6. Close the desiccator and store it in dark conditions for 72 hours at room temperature.
7. Open the desiccators; release the CHCl3 vapor under a fume hood, and transfer the fumigated and non-fumigated soil samples to 250-mL Erlenmeyer flasks.
8. Add 100 mL of 0.5 M K2SO4 solution. Shake the mixture on an orbital shaker for 1 hour.
9. To obtain a clear extract, filter the soil suspensions using Whatman No. 42 filter paper or a centrifuge.
Note: The chloroform is trapped by the oil in the vacuum pump, so the oil must be changed more frequently than usual. Alternatively, chloroform can be captured by a cooling finger to prevent contamination of the vacuum oil. It is not necessary to evacuate the control desiccator.
Pipette 50 mL of soil extract into a 250-mL calibrated digestion tube, and add 1 mL of 0.2 M CuSO4·5H2O solution.
Add 10 mL of concentrated H2SO4 and a few pumice boiling granules, then place the tubes in a rack.
Place the tube rack in the block digester and set the temperature to 150 °C to remove excess water.
Gradually increase the temperature to 380 °C and digest for 3 hours.
Carefully lift the tube rack out of the block digester, allow the tubes to cool to room temperature, and bring to volume with deionized (DI) water.
Each batch of samples for digestion should include at least one blank (no soil) and one EDTA standard (0.1 g EDTA accurately weighed to 0.1 mg).
Before starting a distillation batch, steam out the distillation unit for at least 10 minutes. Adjust the steam rate to 7 to 8 mL of distillate per minute, ensuring that water flows through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep the distillate temperature below 22 °C.
Calibrate the pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (for calibration) and 4.0 (for sensitivity), after adjusting for temperature. Standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not, titrate further aliquots until consistency is achieved.
Dispense 1 mL of saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL of DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placing it underneath the condenser tip, with the tip touching the solution surface.
Pipette a 50 mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask and add 15 mL of 10 N NaOH solution.
Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start the distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lowering the dish to allow the distillate to drain freely into it.
After approximately 4 minutes, when about 35 mL of distillate has been collected, turn off the steam supply and wash the tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.
Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using the Auto-Titrator.
Each distillation should include at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks). The recovery of digested EDTA should be at least 96%.
Notes: After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar and the burette tip thoroughly.
Pipette 8 mL of soil extract into a 100-mL calibrated digestion tube, and add 2 mL of 0.4 N K₂Cr₂O₇ solution.

Place the tubes in the block-digester, set the temperature to 150 °C, and digest for 30 minutes.
Carefully lift the rack out of the block-digester, allow the tubes to cool to room temperature, and transfer the digested sample with 25 mL of deionized (DI) water into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Add 2-3 drops of 1,10-phenanthroline indicator.
Titrate the digested sample with 0.2 N ferrous ammonium sulfate until the color changes from bluish-green to reddish-brown.
Some authors suggest applying empirically derived correction factors to the results. These factors can be obtained by conducting the fumigation/extraction procedure on inert soils containing a known quantity of microbial biomass (e.g., mushrooms or washed bacterial cells). Vance et al. (1987) advocate for a factor of 2.64 for microbial biomass, while Brookes et al. (1985) recommend a factor of 1.46 for biomass nitrogen. If these factors are applied, it should be clearly indicated when reporting results, as the variation in soil microbial and micro-faunal populations may render these factors inapplicable.
The fumigation is conducted in desiccators lined with paper or tissue. After pre-incubating the soil for one week, place the beakers with soil in the desiccators along with a beaker containing 20 mL of ethanol-free CHCl₃ and a few anti-bumping granules.
Phosphorus (P) is a significant nutrient that is often deficient in alkaline-calcareous soils, making it a common measurement in soil laboratories across the WANA (West Asia and North Africa) regions. Soil tests for P are generally reliable in predicting the need for P fertilizer in field crops. However, P compounds in soils are highly variable and depend on soil type or parent material, leading to the use of various extractants globally to evaluate soil fertility. Few procedures are satisfactory for all soil types, and any good test must be well correlated with crop P uptake and calibrated to crop responses to fertilizer application in field situations.
The sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO₃) procedure by Olsen et al. (1954) is widely accepted as a suitable index of P “availability” for alkaline soils, where the solubility of calcium phosphate increases due to the precipitation of Ca as CaCO₃. Field research has confirmed its usefulness in the WANA region, where soils are primarily calcareous (Ryan and Matar, 1990; 1992). Consequently, this soil test has been adapted for routine use in almost all laboratories in the region.

To determine the required acid for acidification, take 10 mL of the 0.5 M NaHCO₃ solution and use the p-nitrophenol indicator to monitor the pH change from yellow to colorless.
Avoid swirling the flasks immediately after adding 1 mL of 5 N H₂SO₄ to prevent excessive frothing.

Construct a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the corresponding phosphorus concentrations.
Determine the phosphorus concentration in the unknown samples using the calibration curve.
If the sample solutions are too dark-colored for measurement against the highest standard, take a smaller aliquot of the soil extract and modify the calculations accordingly. Once the blue color has developed, the solution cannot be diluted.
The intensity of the blue color may vary slightly with each batch of molybdate reagent. Check the standard curve daily using 2 or 3 dilutions of the standard P solution. If the standard curve differs from previous results, draw a new standard curve with fresh molybdate reagent.
Glassware used in phosphorus analysis should not be washed with detergents containing phosphorus, as most detergents do contain it.
Since glass tube density can vary, it is advisable to use the same tube (cuvette) for each absorbance reading on a spectrophotometer.
If the AB-DTPA test (described in Section 5.18.2) is used to evaluate the micronutrient status of the soil, phosphorus can also be determined from the same extract. This "universal" test for alkaline soils allows for the determination of both macronutrients (NO3-N, P, and K) and micronutrients (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) from a single extract.
The color is stable for 24 hours.
Dissolved organic matter does not interfere with this method.
If a glass container is used to store the extracting solution, the pH tends to increase over time, leading to higher values for extractable phosphorus.
In general, the Bray P-1 method extracts approximately the same amount of phosphorus as the Olsen method in the low range, and more in the medium and high ranges, except in highly calcareous soils, where it extracts less phosphorus.
The most commonly used methods for determining available phosphorus in soils are Bray’s method for acidic soils and Olsen’s method for neutral and calcareous/alkaline soils.
The “plant-available phosphorus” fraction is typically a small proportion of total phosphorus. Measuring total phosphorus involves digesting a soil sample with a strong acid, which dissolves all insoluble inorganic and organic phosphorus forms in the minerals. This measurement is generally used only for soil genesis or mineralogical studies (Olsen and Sommers, 1982).

The organic phosphorus (P) content in soils, estimated by the Ignition Method, involves igniting the soil at 550 °C. Simultaneously, inorganic P is estimated by extracting with 1 N sulfuric acid. The organic P content is calculated by subtracting the P in the unignited sample from the P in the ignited sample.

In addition to nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P), potassium (K) is also crucial for crop production. Most soils contain relatively high amounts of total K (1–2%) as components of relatively insoluble minerals. However, only a small fraction (about 1%) is available to plants, existing primarily in water-soluble and exchangeable forms. Highly weathered acid soils in tropical regions are often deficient in plant-available K, while soils in arid and semi-arid areas tend to be well-supplied with K. Generally, soils in the WANA region have adequate K levels, except for sandy and irrigated soils cultivated with high K-requiring crops, such as sugar beet and potatoes.

Measure K in the samples (soil extracts) by taking the emission readings on the flame photometer at 767 nm.
Calculate K concentrations according to the calibration curve.
Exchangeable Na, Ca, and Mg can be measured similarly to exchangeable K. Extractable Na, Ca, and Mg are determined from the NH4OAc extract, while soluble Na, Ca, and Mg are measured in the water extract (saturated paste). The difference represents the exchangeable Na, Ca, and Mg.
After extraction, the filtrate containing K, Mg, Ca, and Na should not be stored for longer than 24 hours unless refrigerated or treated to prevent bacterial growth.
Soils can be stored in an air-dry condition for several months without affecting the exchangeable K, Na, Ca, and Mg content.
Standard solutions for measuring soluble K should be prepared in DI water, while standards for measuring extractable K should be made in NH4OAc solution.
Routine laboratory tests for determining plant-available K do not accurately reflect field conditions due to variations in soil clay mineralogy.
Available K in soils primarily exists in the water-soluble and exchangeable fractions, constituting only a small portion (not more than 1%) of total K in soils.

Measure Na in the samples (soil extracts) using emission readings at 589 nm.
Exchangeable Na is that which is held on the exchange sites or surfaces of clay minerals and is typically the dominant portion of total extractable Na. It can be determined by difference.
The EDTA titration method is preferred due to its accuracy, simplicity, and speed. However, calcium (Ca) and magnesium (Mg) in the extracts can also be measured using an atomic absorption spectrophotometer after the removal of ammonium acetate and organic matter.
The method is based on the principle that calcium, magnesium, and several other cations form stable complexes with versenate (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt, EDTA) at different pH levels. A known volume of standard calcium solution is titrated with a standard 0.01 N EDTA solution using Murexid (ammonium purpurate) indicator in the presence of sodium hydroxide (NaOH) solution.
The endpoint is indicated by a color change from orange-red to purple at pH 12, when all calcium has formed a complex with EDTA. Calcium and magnesium are also present in the solution and can be titrated with 0.01 N EDTA using a buffer solution and a few drops of Eriochrome Black T indicator. The endpoint for this titration is indicated by a color change from red to blue at pH 10. Beyond pH 10, magnesium does not bind strongly to the Eriochrome Black T indicator, resulting in an indistinct endpoint.

If there is not enough saturation extract, prepare a soil-water suspension at a 1:5 ratio. Shake for 30 minutes, filter, and use the filtrate for analysis.
If an atomic absorption spectrophotometer is used, a small aliquot of the saturation extract is sufficient to determine Ca and Mg.
The interference from copper (Cu), zinc (Zn), iron (Fe), and manganese (Mn) is prevented by using a 2% NaCN solution or carbonate. In irrigation waters and water extracts of soil, the quantities of interfering ions are negligible and can be ignored.
Carbonate (CO₃) and bicarbonate (HCO₃) ions are species of the same acid, carbonic acid. Their proportionate content depends on pH, with CO₃ starting to form as pH rises above 8.4. Carbonate and bicarbonate are generally determined in soil saturation extract by titration with 0.01 N H₂SO₄ to pH 8.3 and 4.5, respectively.

Always run two blanks containing all reagents but no soil, treating them the same as the samples. Subtract the blank titration readings from the sample readings.
It is important to determine carbonate and bicarbonate levels soon after preparing the extracts, as CaCO₃ may precipitate upon standing. If other analyses (Ca, Mg, K, Na, Cl, and SO₄) cannot be conducted immediately, refrigerate the extracts.
Soluble chloride is obtained in the saturation extract (prepared as for soluble Ca, Mg, and anions) and its concentration is determined by titration with silver nitrate. This method quantifies Cl concentration (meq/L) in the saturation paste extract. Chloride may also be measured using an ion-selective electrode (potentiometric). The plant's tolerance to Cl can be related to its concentration in the soil saturation paste extract. The method detection limit is approximately 0.1 meq/L, with a typical reproducibility of ± 10%.

Samples containing Cl concentrations greater than the highest standard will require dilution.
Sulfur (S) exists in soils in both organic and inorganic forms. Organic S is a vital component of proteins and amino acids. Major inorganic sources of S include gypsum (CaSO₄) and pyrite (Fe₂S). Sulfur is introduced to soil through fertilizers containing S, such as K₂SO₄, and certain pesticides. It predominantly exists in soil and soil solutions as the sulfate (SO₄-S) anion, often combined with cations like Ca, Mg, K, Na, or NH₄. Phosphate ions, particularly in the form of monocalcium phosphate, are typically preferred for replacing adsorbed SO₄ ions. Extraction can also be performed using CaCl₂ solution; however, phosphate is generally regarded as more effective for the efficient replacement of SO₄ ions.
Under aerobic conditions, elemental S is oxidized to form SO₄, while under anaerobic conditions, it is reduced by microorganisms to form SO₃ and elemental S. Waterlogged or paddy soils, particularly in swampy areas, create a suitable environment for hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) formation.
The total S content in soils varies significantly. Sandy soils in humid regions typically have low S concentrations (around 0.002%), while arid soils can contain as much as 5% SO₄-S. Plants primarily absorb S in the SO₄ form, which is the available form. Sulfate can be extracted using water, NaCl, CaCl₂, NH₄OAc, NaHCO₃, and Ca(H₂PO₄)₂ solutions.
Sulfate in soil extractants is usually determined via barium sulfate precipitation.

Boil for 5 to 10 minutes, cover with a watch glass, and allow to cool.
Filter the solution through ashless filter paper, collecting the barium sulfate precipitate on the paper. Wash several times with warm DI water until no Cl remains, which can be checked using AgNO₃ solution.
After washing, place the filter paper with the precipitate into a pre-weighed and dried porcelain crucible (Wt) and dry in an oven at 105 °C for 1 hour.
Transfer the crucible to a muffle furnace at 550 °C and leave to ash for 2-3 hours.

Prepare a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the respective SO₄-S concentrations.
Determine the SO₄-S concentration in unknown samples using the calibration curve.
Do not allow the standards and unknowns (soil extracts) to stand for longer than 2-3 minutes. If necessary, re-shake the suspension before spectrophotometric reading.
Ensure that the time between shaking and turbidimetric reading is approximately the same for both standards and unknowns.
The use of calcium salts has distinct advantages over sodium or potassium, as calcium helps prevent deflocculation in heavy-textured soils and facilitates easy filtration. The SO₄ in the extract can be estimated turbidimetrically using a spectrophotometer. If the extracted sulfur amount is too low to measure, add a solution of known sulfur concentration to the extract to raise the concentration to a detectable level.
Soils rich in iron and hydrogen sulfide (H₂S) may precipitate as pyrite (Fe₂S), giving the soil a black color.
Accumulation of H₂S in soils is not only toxic to soil organisms but also poses environmental problems. Certain bacteria in the soil can oxidize H₂S into elemental sulfur and sulfate.
The hot-water extraction procedure, initially introduced by Berger and Truog (1939) and later modified, remains the most popular method for measuring "available" boron (B) in soil, specifically the fraction of B related to plant growth in alkaline soils. Water-soluble B, the available form of boron, is extracted from the soil using a water suspension. The concentration of boron in soil extracts is measured calorimetrically using the reagent Azomethine-H (Bingham, 1982). Additionally, boron can be analyzed using colorimetric methods with reagents such as Carmine, or more recently through Inductively Coupled Plasma (ICP) and Atomic Emission Spectrometry. The colorimetric method with Azomethine-H is preferred because using Atomic Absorption Spectrometry (AAS) has limitations, as boron is not a metal.
When soil boron levels are below 0.5 ppm, deficiency is likely to occur for most crops. Conversely, levels exceeding approximately 5 ppm may lead to toxicity. The normal concentration of boron in plant tissue is reported to be between 20 and 100 μg/mg of dry matter in mature leaves. Boron plays a crucial role in sugar translocation and the synthesis of hormones and proteins in plants.
Buffer Solution: Dissolve 250 g of ammonium acetate (NH₄OAc) and 15 g of ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA disodium) in 400 mL of deionized (DI) water. Slowly add 125 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and mix well.

Determine the B concentration in unknown samples from the calibration curve.
Minimize the use of glassware; when necessary, use glassware treated with concentrated HCl for one week.
Using Azomethine-H improves the procedure compared to carmine and curcumin, as it does not require concentrated acid.
The amount of charcoal used may vary based on the organic matter content of the soil and should be sufficient to achieve a colorless extract after boiling for 5 minutes. Excess charcoal can reduce extractable boron values.
5. In arid region soils, borate ions are usually not affected by leaching. Therefore, they are strongly basic in reaction and may contain excessive amounts of boron (B) for plant growth.
6. Boron deficiency is more likely to occur in Ultisols and Oxisols, whereas B toxicity may be noted in Aridisols. This contrasts with the behavior of other micronutrients.
While the hot water extraction method (HWE) is popular for predicting boron fertility in alkaline soils, the procedure is tedious and prone to error due to the difficulty in maintaining uniform boiling time. To provide a convenient alternative, researchers (Kausar et al., 1990; Rashid et al., 1994; Rashid et al., 1997) have found the dilute HCl method proposed by Ponnamperuma et al. (1981), originally designed for acid soils, to be equally effective in diagnosing boron deficiency in alkaline and calcareous soils. The HCl method is simple, economical, and more efficient.
To prepare the extraction solution, dissolve 250 g of ammonium acetate (NH4OAc) and 15 g of ethylenediamine-tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA disodium) in 400 mL of deionized (DI) water. Slowly add 125 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH3COOH) and mix well.

Although required by plants in much smaller amounts than major nutrients (e.g., nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium), micronutrients are essential for crop growth. The solubility of micronutrient cations decreases with increasing soil pH. As most soils in the WANA region are alkaline, deficiencies in micronutrients are common and are becoming more frequent and widespread due to the intensification of cropping practices.
The Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy method is commonly used to measure Zn, Cu, Mn, and Fe. The running parameters specific to a particular model are provided in the software included with the equipment manual. Accordingly, the current supply, wavelength of the hollow cathode lamp, integration time, and anticipated estimation ranges are fixed.
The diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) test by Lindsay and Norvell (1978) is widely used for evaluating fertility status concerning micronutrient cations, namely Fe, Zn, Mn, and Cu. The DTPA method is an important and widely utilized chelating agent that combines with free metal ions in the solution to form soluble complexes of these elements. The DTPA method can complex each of the micronutrient cations at a capacity of up to ten times their atomic weight, with a range of 550 to 650 mg/kg depending on the specific micronutrient. However, the universal soil test for alkaline soils (i.e., AB-DTPA, as described in Section 5.18.2) is equally effective for determining micronutrient cations in such soils. Deficiencies of Mo, Cl, Ni, and Co are not known to occur in alkaline soils.
Weigh 1.97 g of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) and 1.1 g of calcium chloride (CaCl₂), or 1.47 g of calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl₂·2H₂O), into a beaker. Dissolve this in deionized (DI) water and transfer to a 1-liter volumetric flask.
In another beaker, weigh 14.92 g (or add 13.38 mL) of triethanolamine (TEA), then transfer with DI water into the 1-liter flask, bringing the total volume to about 900 mL.

Then, use 10 mL of this diluted stock solution in a 100-mL flask and dilute to volume, resulting in a solution containing 10 ppm Mn.

Calculate the concentrations of micronutrient cations according to the calibration curve.
The theoretical basis for the DTPA extraction lies in the equilibrium of the metals in the soil with the chelating agent. A pH of 7.3 allows DTPA to effectively extract Fe and other metals.
The DTPA reagent should be in its acid form (not a di-sodium salt).
To avoid excessive dissolution of CaCO3, which can release occluded micronutrients that are not available to crops in calcareous soils and may lead to erroneous results, the extractant is buffered to a slightly alkaline pH.
Triethanolamine (TEA) is used as a buffer because it burns clearly during the atomization of the extractant solution while being measured on the AAS.
The extracting solution can be stored for up to 2 weeks under mineral oil, and the pH should be adjusted to 7.6 if necessary.
The duration of shaking is crucial, as trace elements continue to dissolve (non-equilibrium extraction). Therefore, factors such as shaking time, speed, and vessel shape are critical and should be standardized in every laboratory.
The AB-DTPA is a multi-element soil test for alkaline soils developed by Soltanpour and Schwab (1977) and later modified by Soltanpour and Workman (1979) to exclude the use of carbon black. The extracting solution is 1 M in ammonium bicarbonate (NH4HCO3) and 0.005 M DTPA, adjusted to pH 7.6. This method can also determine NO3-N, P, and K in the same extract. It is highly correlated with the sodium bicarbonate method for P, the ammonium acetate method for K, and the DTPA method for Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu. Its range and sensitivity are equivalent to those of the DTPA test, sodium bicarbonate test, and ammonium acetate test for micronutrients, P, and K, respectively.
Add 1.97 g of diethylene triamine pentaacetic acid (DTPA) to 800 mL of deionized (DI) water. Then add 2 mL of 1:1 ammonium hydroxide (NH4OH) to facilitate dissolution and to prevent effervescence when bicarbonate is added. This solution contains 0.005 M DTPA.

The heavy metals of concern in agriculture, particularly regarding environmental impact, include Cadmium (Cd), Lead (Pb), Mercury (Hg), Chromium (Cr), Selenium (Se), Nickel (Ni), Cobalt (Co), Molybdenum (Mo), and Arsenic (As). To release mineral elements from soil and sediments, a wet oxidation process is employed. This process utilizes oxidizing acids, specifically a mixture of HNO3-HClO4-HF (tri-acid mixture) or a di-acid mixture of HNO3-HClO4. The di-acid oxidation method is simpler, less time-consuming, and more convenient; however, it does not achieve total digestion, as certain soil components, particularly silicate minerals, do not dissolve completely. Consequently, di-acid digestion is referred to as pseudo digestion or partial digestion.

The use of HClO4 prevents volatilization loss of K and provides a clear solution.
The application of HF solution aids in the removal of silica.
If the contents of the tube solidify and do not dissolve, reheat the tubes until the precipitate (gypsum) dissolves, then cool with tap water.
Soluble Silicon (Si) refers to the amount of Si available in the soil solution. It is the most labile form of Si and primarily consists of monomeric silica acid (H3SiO4). Extraction with 0.01 M CaCl2 solution minimizes interference from high levels of CaCO3 in the soil. H3SiO4 can be quantified colorimetrically through its reaction with molybdate, with blue (this procedure) and yellow analysis methods commonly used.

After 5 minutes, add 10 mL of L-ascorbic acid solution to reduce Si, changing the color from yellow to blue.
Measure the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 660 nm.
To determine the silicon (Si) concentration in the unknown samples, refer to the calibration curve.
It is important to note that glassware might be a source of Si contamination. Therefore, a blank sample should be analyzed for Si; if significant concentrations are found, they should be subtracted from the soil sample results. If possible, use plastic flasks instead of glass throughout the analysis.
The timing of sampling, along with factors such as variety or hybrid and environmental conditions (including soil moisture, temperature, and light quality and intensity), can significantly influence the relationship between nutrient concentration and plant response. Proper sampling is crucial; without it, analyses may yield meaningless results, wasting time and resources. The analytical procedures outlined here are based on established reference materials in the literature (e.g., Walsh and Beaton, 1973; Westerman, 1990; Reuter and Robinson, 1986; Sparks et al., 1996).
Plant samples should be placed in labeled, perforated plastic or paper bags.
Tags and markers are essential.
Check the bags for cleanliness and durability.
Transport plant samples to the laboratory in cardboard boxes.
Record all sample information, assigning each a laboratory number.
Use a clean tray or cloth for collecting plants and sub-sampling.
Create a sketch of the field layout, labeling sampled areas consistently with sample containers to maintain a record of which recommendations apply to which areas—do not rely solely on memory.
Complete information sheets clearly, using a copying pen; the more details you provide, the better the recommendations will be.
For uniform plant growth, take one composite sample from at least 10 widely scattered areas in the field, requiring one plant sample and one soil sample.
In fields where crop growth or appearance varies, plant analysis can help identify the causes and suggest corrective measures. Samples should be collected when abnormalities are noticed, requiring two plant and two soil samples, including those from normal areas.
The optimal sampling time typically occurs just before the reproductive stage for many plants, though specific plants or conditions may warrant sampling at different times.
Sample plants showing suspected nutrient deficiency symptoms at the time of observation or shortly after visual symptoms appear.
For all plant analyses, at least a rounded double handful of plant tissue is required.
Leaves are most commonly sampled; recently matured leaves are preferred, while new and old growth should generally be avoided. However, young emerging leaves may be sampled to diagnose iron (Fe) chlorosis by determining the ferrous (Fe) content of fresh leaves (Katyal and Sharma, 1980) and boron (B) content in certain crops (Bell, 1997). Exclude damaged or diseased leaves, and do not sample plants under moisture or temperature stress.
Seeds are rarely used for analysis, except for assessing boron (B) toxicity, zinc (Zn), and phosphorus (P) deficiency in certain grain crops. In some cases, such as with cereals, the entire above-ground portion of young plants is sampled.
Avoid any type of contamination at all stages. Plant samples should never be stored alongside fertilizers and detergents. Contamination is likely to occur if plant samples are spread out to dry near stored fertilizers or on floors where fertilizers were previously stored.
Sampling procedures for important dryland crops in the WANA region are provided in Appendix 10.
Do not include diseased or dead plant material in a sample.
Do not sample or include plants or leaf tissue that has been damaged by insects or mechanically injured. When whole plants are sampled, remove the roots and wash the upper portion to eliminate soil particles.
Avoid sampling plants that have been extensively stressed by cold, heat, moisture deficiency, or excess moisture. Examine both the below-ground and above-ground portions of the plant. The presence of nematodes or roots damaged by other insects or diseases should prevent sampling.
To avoid decomposition during transport to the laboratory, which would render the samples useless for analysis, samples should be taken to the laboratory as quickly as possible.
A history form should be placed in a small envelope, which is then put inside a larger envelope containing the dried sample.
Sample preparation is critical for obtaining accurate analytical data and reliable interpretation of plant analysis results. Proven procedures must be followed during handling in the laboratory, decontamination, drying, grinding, mixing, and storage. These preparatory procedures enhance the accuracy and reliability of the analytical results.
As soon as the plant samples are received at the preparation laboratory, they should be checked against the accompanying information list. Information about the samples should be recorded in a register, and each sample should be assigned a laboratory number.
Keep plant samples refrigerated until cleaning, ensuring that fermentation does not occur.
Decontamination procedures, involving washing and rinsing, should only be used for fresh, fully turgid plant samples. After decontamination, samples should be dried immediately to stabilize the tissue and halt enzymatic reactions.
A preliminary dry-wiping can be done if the plant sample is very dirty.
If the plant samples are too dirty for dry-wiping, washing them in a nylon bag is acceptable.
Samples must be cleaned properly, but no part should remain submerged in water for more than a few seconds.
Clean plant tissue to remove dust, pesticide, and fertilizer residues, typically by washing with deionized (DI) water or a 0.1–0.3% phosphate-free detergent (like HCl 1%), followed by rinsing with DI water.
Rinse each portion of the plant sample in a bath of DI water, plunging it in, agitating, and immediately withdrawing. Change the water and repeat the rinsing. Dry by shaking vigorously by hand.
Plant samples for soluble element determination should not be washed for extended periods. However, plant samples for total iron (Fe) analysis must be washed.
Excessive washing is counterproductive, as it can cause soluble elements, including boron (B), potassium (K), and nitrogen (N), to leach from the tissue.
The plant sample material should be evenly and thinly spread in a container.
Place containers in a well-ventilated drying oven.
If samples absorb significant amounts of moisture during grinding, additional drying may be required before weighing for analysis.
The required drying time will vary; dry to a constant weight.
The original condition and size of the sample will affect drying time.
The drying temperature should not exceed 70 °C, as higher temperatures may cause volatilization loss.
Drying at temperatures below 70 °C may not remove all combined water, resulting in poor homogenization and incorrect analytical results.
Drying temperatures above 70 °C may lead to thermal decomposition and reduce dry weight.
A drying time of 24 hours may be sufficient under normal conditions.
Longer drying times may be needed depending on the type and number of plant samples in the dryer.
Quick drying of a limited number of samples can be done using a microwave oven, with the drying process closely monitored.
Plant tissue samples are reduced to a particle size of 0.5 to 1.0 mm to ensure homogeneity and facilitate organic matter destruction.
Use standard mills equipped with 20, 40, and 60-mesh screens and stainless steel contact points.
The Tecator Cyclotec sample mill (standard equipped with a 1-mm sieve) or an equivalent high-speed grinder is recommended.
A medium bristle brush should be available for cleaning.
After drying, samples should be ground to pass a 1.0-mm screen (20 mesh) using the appropriate Wiley mill. A 20-mesh sieve is adequate if the sample aliquot to be assayed is greater than 0.5 g. If the aliquot is less than 0.5 g, a 40-mesh screen should be used.
After grinding, the sample should be thoroughly mixed, and a 5 to 8 g aliquot withdrawn for analyses and storage.
Clean the grinding apparatus with a brush or vacuum system after each sample.
Uniform grinding and mixing are critical for obtaining accurate analytical results.
Exercise care when grinding very small samples or plant materials that are pubescent, deliquescent, or have a fibrous texture, as these can be difficult to grind in Wiley mills. In such cases, Cyclotec or equivalent high-speed grinders are preferable.
Most mechanical mills contribute some contamination of the sample with one or more elements, depending on the condition of the mill and exposure time.
Use stainless steel for cutting and sieving surfaces to minimize contamination.
Routine maintenance of mills is essential to ensure optimal operating conditions.
Maintain cutting knives or blades in sharp condition and properly adjusted.
Avoid cross-contamination between samples by thoroughly cleaning the sample mill with a dry brush or by using dry air under pressure.
If the plant sample is large enough, the mill can be rinsed with the material to be ground.
When sampling mixed stands, particularly forages and pastures, separate plant species. Similarly, the sample should consist of only leaves, petioles, or whole tops, and not mixtures.
After grinding and mixing (homogenization), samples should be stored in conditions that minimize deterioration and maintain sample integrity for weighing and follow-up analytical work.
The storage cabinet should be located in a cool, dark, and moisture-free environment.
After grinding and homogenization, a representative sub-sample is taken from the ground plant material for analysis and storage. This sub-sample should be placed in a container that can be securely sealed.
Containers should then be stored in a cool, dry place.
For long-term storage, ground samples should be thoroughly dried, sealed, and placed under refrigerated conditions (4 °C) until the required analysis can be completed.
Dried and milled samples should be stored in flasks with tight stoppers or in sealed polyethylene bags, protected from direct sunlight.
During storage, the plant material may attract moisture, so the drying procedure must be repeated just before weighing out a sample for analysis.
Dry the sample for 1 hour at 70 °C before analysis.
If samples are stored in a cool (4 °C), dark, dry environment, their storage life is indefinite.
Small manila envelopes can also be used for sample storage, but care must be taken to prevent moisture absorption. Collect the ground sample in the envelope and immediately place it in a desiccator cabinet to minimize moisture absorption.
After soil testing, plant analysis is critical for improving crop nutrition and yield. Nutritionally, plant analysis is based on the principle that the concentration of a nutrient within the plant reflects the interaction of all factors that have influenced it. The principles and procedures used for plant analyses have evolved over many years and adapted as knowledge about essential elements for plant life cycles has increased. Consequently, plant analyses have become integral to most agronomic research and serve as a valuable tool for crop consultants and fertilizer dealers in monitoring production fields.
Nutrient concentrations in plant tissues can be measured in plant extracts obtained from fresh material (i.e., tissue analysis) as well as in whole dried material. The former test is qualitative and suitable for quick assessments of growing crops. Total plant analysis, being quantitative, is more reliable and informative. Generalized ranges for nutrient concentrations indicating deficiency, adequacy, and excess in cereal crops are provided in Appendix 11. Forms of nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), boron (B), and micronutrient cations are of primary concern. More detailed interpretative guidelines for plant analysis data can be found in works by Reuter and Robinson (1986, 1997), Munson and Nelson (1990), and Jones et al. (1991).
Confirming diagnoses made from visible symptoms.
Identifying “hidden hunger” where no symptoms are apparent.
Locating soil areas with deficiencies in one or more nutrients.
Determining whether applied nutrients have been absorbed by the plant.
Analyzing relationships among various nutrients.
Studying the internal functioning of nutrients within plants.
Suggesting additional tests or studies to identify crop production issues.
Weighing oven-dried samples can be cumbersome (involving continuous oven-drying and the use of desiccators, which are still prone to error), as plant material may absorb moisture during weighing, particularly in high relative humidity. To mitigate this issue, a moisture factor can be used instead. This factor for each batch of samples can be calculated by oven-drying a few sub-samples from the lot (approximately 5 from a batch of 100–200 samples).
Plants require a wide range of proteins for their growth, development, and maturation. The primary building blocks of proteins are amino acids, with nitrogen (N) being the major component. Nitrogen is also a key element in chlorophyll. Soil microorganisms utilize soil nitrogen during the decomposition of organic materials. Adequate nitrogen enhances the quality of leafy vegetables, promoting rapid growth; however, an imbalance with other nutrients may delay flowering and fruiting.
The nitrogen content in plant dry matter typically ranges from 1% to 5%, although it can occasionally fall below or exceed this range. The common method for analyzing nitrogen is the Kjeldahl method, although wet ashing with sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) and hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) is also employed to avoid the use of selenium (Se) in the former method.
A. Catalyst Mixture (K₂SO₄-Se): Use a 100:1 weight-to-weight ratio. Grind reagent-grade chemicals separately and mix. If the mixture is caked, grind it in a porcelain pestle and mortar through a 60-mesh screen (0.250 mm). Take precautions to avoid inhaling Se dust or skin contact.
B. Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄): Use concentrated (98%, specific gravity 1.84).
C. Sodium Hydroxide Solution (NaOH), 10 N: Dissolve 400 g of NaOH in deionized (DI) water, transfer to a 1-L heavy-walled Pyrex flask, cool, and adjust to volume with DI water.
D. Boric Acid Solution (H₃BO₃): Prepare a saturated solution by adding 500 g of H₃BO₃ to a 5-L flask, followed by 3 L of DI water. Swirl vigorously and let it sit overnight, ensuring there is solid H₃BO₃ at the bottom.
E. Tris Solution [hydroxymethyl aminomethane] (C₄H₁₁NO₃), 0.01 N: Dry reagent-grade Tris in an oven at 80 °C for 3 hours, cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle. Dissolve 1.2114 g of Tris in DI water, transferring the solution to a 1-L flask and adjusting to volume.
F. Sulfuric Acid Solution (H₂SO₄), 0.01 N: Prepare by adding 28 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ to about 600-800 mL of DI water in a 1-L flask. Mix well, cool, and adjust to volume. This produces a 1 N H₂SO₄ stock solution. Pipette 10 mL of this stock solution into a 1-L flask and adjust to volume with DI water to achieve 0.01 N H₂SO₄.
in DI water, bringing the solution to 1-L volume. This yields a concentration of 1.2 g NH₄-N/L (stock solution).
Sample Preparation: Mix finely ground (using a cyclone mill) plant samples uniformly on a sheet of paper.
Sub-sampling: Select representative sub-samples of about 1 g by taking at least 10 small portions from various parts of the sample using a spatula, placing them into a plastic vial.
Drying: Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C overnight and cool it in a desiccator.
Weighing: Weigh 0.25 g (for grain) or 0.50 g (for straw) of dry plant material, transferring it into a 100-mL digestion tube.
Adding Granules and Catalyst: Add a few pumice boiling granules and approximately 3 g of the catalyst mixture using a calibrated spoon.
Adding Acid: Add 10 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ using a dispenser, then mix with a vortex tube stirrer.
Digestion Process: Place the tubes in a block digester set at 100 °C for 20 minutes. After this period, wash down any adhering material from the neck of the tube with concentrated H₂SO₄, thoroughly agitate the tube contents, and return them to the block digester set at 380 °C for 2 hours.
Final Steps: After digestion, remove the tubes, cool them, and adjust to 100-mL volume with DI water.
Reagent Blank and Standards: Ensure that each batch of samples for digestion includes at least one reagent blank (no plant) and one chemical standard (0.1 g EDTA standard digest), as well as one standard plant sample (internal reference).
Calibrate the pH meter using buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (for calibration) and pH 4.0 (for sensitivity) after setting the appropriate temperature. Then, standardize the 0.01 N H₂SO₄ in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if they do not, continue titrating additional aliquots until agreement is achieved.
Dispense 1 mL of saturated H₃BO₃ solution and 1 mL of deionized (DI) water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish placed underneath the condenser tip, ensuring the tip is in contact with the solution surface.
Pipette a 10-mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask.
Carefully add 10 mL of 10 N NaOH solution, then immediately connect the flask to the distillation unit and begin the distillation.
Collect approximately 35 mL of distillate in the collecting dish.
Remove the distillation flask and connect an empty 100-mL distillation flask to the distillation unit. Drain water from the condenser jacket and steam out the apparatus for 90 seconds before connecting the next sample.
Titrate the distillate to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H₂SO₄ using an Auto-Titrator, and record the titration volume of acid.
Each distillation should include at least two standards (pipette 10 mL of digested solution) and two blanks (pipette 10 mL of digested solution). The recovery of nitrogen (N) should be at least 96%.
After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode in the dish. Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the digested sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off the cooling water supply (draining water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds. Each distillation should contain at least two standards and two blanks (reagent blanks).
Samples should contain approximately 1 mg of nitrogen (but no more than 5 mg). The sensitivity of the procedure depends on several factors, including sample weight, strength of the acid, and accuracy of titration.
If the ratio of acid to salt is low at the end of the digestion step, a significant amount of ammonia (NH₃) may be volatilized during digestion. Situations to avoid that may cause nitrogen loss during digestion include localized heating in the digestion flask (temperatures above 410°C) and using 30% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) as an oxidant.
The time required for digestion is influenced by the catalyst, temperature, and type of plant tissue. It is important to allow an equal length of additional time after the sample clears, as up to 10% of organic nitrogen may not yet be converted to ammonium (NH₄) at this point.
Homogeneity of the sample is crucial for precision. For best results, dried tissue should pass through a 40-mesh sieve. If the sample size is less than 0.25 g, special care must be taken to ensure sample homogeneity.
Digested samples may be stored for several days if covered and placed in a cool area.
Samples distilled into the H₃BO₃ solution should be titrated within a short time to prevent absorption of atmospheric CO₂.
Weigh 0.5 g of dry plant material into a 100-mL digestion tube.
Add 3-4 pumice boiling granules, followed by 5 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄. Mix well.
Heat on a block digester at a moderate temperature of 100–150 °C.
Swirl the tube to reduce foaming. If foaming enters the neck of the digestion tube, add 2 mL of 30% H₂O₂.
Heat the tubes for 30–60 minutes on the block digester.
Cool the tubes, then add another 2 mL of 30% H₂O₂.
Raise the temperature of the block digester to 280 °C.
Heat the tubes for 10 minutes at 280 °C.
Cool the tubes, then add 2 mL of 30% H₂O₂, and heat for another 10 minutes.
Repeat Steps 8 and 9 until the solution remains clear after 10 minutes of heating.
Cool the tubes and adjust the volume to 100 mL with deionized (DI) water.
Nitrogen content can be measured in this digest using the Distillation Method (Kjeldahl unit).
Phosphorus can be measured colorimetrically, similar to methods used for P measurement in plants, after filtering the digest through Whatman No. 1 or No. 5 filter paper.
The results for both nitrogen (N) and phosphorus (P) are highly correlated with the standard Kjeldahl digestion method.
This method involves digesting plant material in a sulfuric-salicylic acid mixture (Buresh et al., 1982).
Dissolve 62.5 g of reagent-grade salicylic acid (C₇H₆O₃) in 2.5 L of concentrated H₂SO₄.
Grind the reagent-grade chemicals separately and mix them. If caked, grind the mixture in a porcelain pestle and mortar to pass through a 60-mesh screen (0.250 mm), taking care to avoid inhaling selenium dust or allowing it to come into contact with skin.
Mix and spread the finely ground plant sample in a thin layer on a sheet of paper or plastic until it appears uniform.
Take a representative sub-sample of about 1 g by systematically withdrawing at least 10 small portions from all parts of the sample with a spatula, and transfer them into a plastic vial.
Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C in an oven overnight, then cool in a desiccator.
Weigh 0.25 g (grain) or 0.50 g (straw) of dry plant material, and transfer it quantitatively into a dry 250-mL digestion tube.
Add 20 mL of the sulfuric-salicylic acid mixture while rotating the tube to wash down any sample adhering to the neck, and allow it to stand for 2 hours or longer with occasional swirling.
Add 2.5 g of sodium thiosulfate through a long-stemmed funnel to the contents of the tube and swirl gently a few times; allow it to stand overnight.
Add 4 g of the catalyst mixture and 3–4 pumice boiling granules, then place the tubes in a block digester preheated to 400 °C.
Insert a small glass funnel into the mouths of the tubes to ensure efficient refluxing of the digestion mixture and prevent the loss of H₂SO₄, and continue digestion until the mixture clears.
Remove the tubes from the block digester and allow them to cool for about 20 minutes. Then wash down any material adhering to the neck of the tube with a minimum quantity of DI water.
Thoroughly agitate the tube contents, place the tubes back on the block digester, and digest for 2 hours after clearing. No particulate material should remain in the tube after digestion.
After digestion is complete, allow the digest to cool, then slowly add water while shaking until the liquid level is about 2 cm below the graduation mark.
Allow the tube to cool to room temperature, then add DI water to bring the volume to the 250-mL mark.
Before starting a distillation batch, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust the steam rate to 7–8 mL of distillate per minute. Ensure that water flows through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep the distillate temperature below 22 °C.
Calibrate the pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (for calibration) and pH 4.0 (for sensitivity) after setting it for temperature. Then standardize the 0.01 N H2SO4 in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not, continue titrating further aliquots until agreement is reached.
Dispense 1 mL of saturated H3BO3 solution and 1 mL of DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placing it under the condenser tip with the tip touching the solution surface.
Prior to distillation, shake the digestion tube to thoroughly mix its contents, then pipette an aliquot into a 300-mL distillation flask.
Carefully add 7 mL of 10 N NaOH solution for a 25-mL aliquot (or 15 mL for a 50-mL aliquot), immediately connect the flask to the distillation unit, and begin distillation.
Collect about 35 mL of distillate in the collecting dish.
After removing the distillation flask, connect an empty 100-mL distillation flask to the unit. Drain the water from the condenser jacket and steam out the apparatus for 90 seconds before connecting the next sample.
The distillate should then be titrated to pH 5.0 with standardized 0.01 N H2SO4 using the Auto-Titrator; record the titration volume of acid.
Each distillation should include at least two standards and two reagent blanks. The recovery of EDTA, corrected for the reagent blank, should be at least 97%.
Notes: After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode in the dish. Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the unit. Place an empty 100-mL beaker under the condenser tip, turn off the cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds.
Phosphorus (P) is essential for crop production; it stimulates early root formation and growth, promotes rapid plant development, and enhances flower and seed production. P is also vital in the genetic material that controls cell division. The P content in plants typically ranges from 0.1% to 0.5% of dry matter. Total P in plant material can be determined using either a wet-digestion or dry-ashing procedure (described in Section 7.4.1). Both methods are effective, but dry-ashing is simpler, non-hazardous, and more economical. Later, the P content in digests or dissolved ash aliquots is measured colorimetrically.
Equipment Required: Spectrophotometer or colorimeter, vortex tube stirrer, block digester.
(NH4)6Mo7O24⋅4H2O in 400 mL of DI water (Solution a).
Dissolve 1.25 g of ammonium metavanadate (NH4VO3) in 300 mL of hot DI water (Solution b).
Combine both solutions (a) and (b) in a 1-L flask and allow the mixture to cool to room temperature.
Gradually add 250 mL of concentrated HNO3 to the mixture, cool the solution, and bring it to a final volume of 1 L with DI water.
Dry approximately 2.5 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) in an oven at 105 °C for 1 hour. Allow it to cool in a desiccator and store it in a tightly stoppered bottle.
Dissolve 0.2197 g of the dried KH₂PO₄ in deionized (DI) water and dilute to a final volume of 1 L. This solution contains 50 ppm phosphorus (P) and serves as the Stock Solution.
Dilute 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mL of the Stock Solution to 100 mL in numbered flasks by adding DI water and bringing to volume. These solutions will contain 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, and 2.5 ppm P, respectively.
Mix and spread the finely ground plant sample in a thin, uniform layer on a sheet of paper or plastic.
Take a representative sub-sample of about 1 g by systematically withdrawing at least 10 small portions from various parts of the sample using a spatula, and transfer them into a plastic vial.
Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C in an oven overnight, and then cool in a desiccator.
Weigh 0.25 g of dry plant material (for grains) or 0.50 g (for straw) and transfer it quantitatively into a 100-mL digestion tube.
Add a few pumice boiling granules and approximately 3 g of catalyst mixture using a calibrated spoon.
Add 10 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ using a dispenser, and mix thoroughly with a vortex tube stirrer.
Place the tubes in a block digester set at 100 °C for 20 minutes. Afterward, wash down any material adhering to the neck of the tube with the same concentrated H₂SO₄.
Agitate the tube contents thoroughly, then return the tubes to the block digester set at 380 °C for 2 hours after clearing.
After digestion is complete, remove the tubes, allow them to cool, and bring to a final volume of 100 mL with DI water.
Each batch of samples for digestion should include at least one reagent blank (no plant), one chemical standard (0.1 g EDTA standard digest), and one standard plant sample (internal reference).
Pipette 10 mL of the clear filtrate into a 100-mL flask.
Add 10 mL of ammonium-vanadomolybdate reagent and dilute the solution to volume with DI water.
Pipette 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 mL of the standard stock solution, and process them as with the samples.
Prepare a blank with 10 mL of ammonium-vanadomolybdate reagent, processing it the same way as the samples.
Measure the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples after 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 410 nm.
Create a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the respective P concentrations.
Determine the P concentration in the unknown samples using the calibration curve.
Plant analysis through dry ashing is simple, non-hazardous, and less expensive compared to HNO₃-HClO₄ wet digestion. Dry ashing is suitable for analyzing phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na). Micronutrient cations (iron [Fe], zinc [Zn], copper [Cu], and manganese [Mn]) can also be analyzed using dry ashing, but only in plant tissues with low silica content (like legumes). This procedure is based on the work of Chapman and Pratt (1961) with slight modifications. The HNO₃-HClO₄ wet digestion (described in Section 7.4.3) is necessary for full recovery of micronutrient cations in high-silica plant tissues (e.g., wheat, barley, rice, and sugarcane).
Dry ashing is typically conducted at an ignition temperature of 550 °C to 600 °C, followed by extraction in diluted HCl or H₂SO₄ for determining various elements. The ashing process results in considerable volatile loss of P, K, sulfur (S), and chlorine (Cl). Due to these losses and the time-consuming nature of the process, dry ashing is only occasionally adopted.
Phosphorus (P), potassium (K), calcium (Ca), and magnesium (Mg) can be determined in plant tissue concentrations ranging from 0.1 to 0.7% P, 0.5 to 5% K, 0.2 to 2% Ca, and 0.1 to 1% Mg. Manganese (Mn) and iron (Fe) can be determined in concentrations from 25 to 500 ppm. Copper (Cu) and zinc (Zn) can be measured in the range of 5 to 50 ppm. These ranges may be extended by dilution or by calibrating the instrument for higher concentrations.
Hydrochloric Acid (HCl), 2N: Dilute 165.6 mL of concentrated HCl (37%, specific gravity 1.19) in deionized (DI) water, mix well, let it cool, and bring to a final volume of 1 L.
Weigh 0.5 – 1.0 g of dry, ground plant material in a 30 – 50 mL porcelain crucible or Pyrex glass beaker.
Place the crucibles in a cool muffle furnace and gradually increase the temperature to 550 °C.
Continue ashing for 5 hours after reaching 550 °C.
Turn off the muffle furnace and open the door cautiously for rapid cooling.
Once cooled, carefully remove the crucibles.
Dissolve the cooled ash in 5-mL portions of 2N HCl and mix with a plastic rod.
After 15 – 20 minutes, bring the solution to a total volume of 50 mL using DI water.
Mix thoroughly, allow it to stand for about 30 minutes, and then use the supernatant or filter through Whatman No. 42 filter paper, discarding the first portions of the filtrate.
Analyze the aliquots for P using Colorimetry (via the Ammonium Vanadate-Ammonium Molybdate yellow color method), K and Na via Flame Photometry, Ca and Mg by titration with EDTA, and Zn, Cu, Fe, and Mn using Atomic Absorption Spectroscopy.
For Ca and Mg measurement, the final dilution should contain 1% w/v lanthanum (La), and determinations should be made against standards and a blank with a similar La concentration to mitigate anionic interference.
If a clean white ash remains after muffling, oxidation is complete and ashing aids are unnecessary.
Plant materials with high sugar or oil content (highly carbonaceous) may require ashing aids such as 10% H₂SO₄, concentrated HNO₃, or 7% Mg(NO₃)₂·6H₂O.
Dry ashing is not recommended for plant materials high in silicon (Si), as it can lead to low micronutrient values, particularly for Zn.
Dry ashing tends to produce lower Fe and Al values compared to wet ashing.
Sensitivity can vary depending on the instrument and the wavelength selected for each element.
This method experiences minimal interference, except for spectral overlap, which occurs when an element emits a wavelength very close to that of another element being analyzed, and the instrument's optical system cannot resolve the two wavelengths.
Samples to be analyzed after storage should be placed in an oven at 30 °C for 4 hours before weighing.
The crucible used for ashing should first be rinsed in DI water, followed by several rinses in 25% HCl, and then rinsed multiple times with DI water before drying in an oven.
When an organic solution is needed for determining some micronutrients such as Cu, special attention must be given to the cleaning of glassware or separation funnels by shaking with the reagent and organic solution.
There are no reported interferences for Mn, Cu, and Zn.
The presence of HNO₃ and nickel (Ni) or Si may decrease the sensitivity of Fe. Using a very hot, lean-burning air/acetylene flame can help mitigate these interferences.
A. Sulfuric Acid (H₂SO₄), 0.36 N: To prepare this solution, dilute 10.08 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ (98%, specific gravity 1.84) in deionized (DI) water, mix well, allow it to cool, and adjust the final volume to 1 liter.
Dissolve 250 g of ammonium acetate (NH₄OAc) and 15 g of ethylenediamine tetraacetic acid disodium salt (EDTA disodium) in 400 mL of DI water. Slowly add 125 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and mix thoroughly.
Dissolve 0.45 g of Azomethine-H and 1 g of L-ascorbic acid in 100 mL of DI water. This reagent should be prepared weekly and stored in a refrigerator.
Dissolve 0.114 g of boric acid (H₃BO₃) in DI water and bring to a total volume of 1 liter. This solution contains 20 ppm of boron (B).
Preparation of Standard Solutions: Prepare a series of standard solutions from the stock solution by diluting 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15.0 mL of the stock solution to 100 mL in labeled flasks with DI water. These solutions will contain 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 ppm of B, respectively.
Weigh 1 g of dry, ground plant material and place it in a porcelain crucible.
Ignite in a muffle furnace, slowly raising the temperature to 550 °C.
Continue ashing for an additional 6 hours after reaching 550 °C.
Wet the ash with five drops of DI water, then add 10 mL of 0.36 N H₂SO₄ solution to the crucible.
Heat the mixture on a steam bath for 20 minutes.
Allow the mixture to stand at room temperature for 1 hour, stirring occasionally with a plastic rod to break up the ash.
Filter the mixture through Whatman No. 1 filter paper into a 50 mL polypropylene flask and bring to volume. The filtrate is now ready for boron determination.
Pipette 1 mL of the extract into a 10 mL polypropylene tube.
Add 2 mL of Azomethine-H solution and mix well.
Prepare a standard curve by pipetting 1 mL of each standard (0.5 – 3.0 ppm) and processing them the same way as the samples. Prepare a blank with 1 mL of DI water.
Measure the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples after 30 minutes using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420 nm.
Create a calibration curve by plotting absorbance against the corresponding B concentrations.
Determine the B concentration in unknown samples using the calibration curve.
Avoid using borosilicate glassware; instead, always use glassware treated with concentrated HCl for a week when absolutely necessary. Contamination during boron determination may originate from chemical reagents rather than glassware. Therefore, ensure that all reagents are purified before use.
To mitigate interference from NH₄, use NH₄OAc; for K, use KOAc; and for Al, Cu, and Fe, employ EDTA.
Treating DI water with charcoal can remove organic substances that may interfere with color development.
Any interference from residual H₂O₂ with color development can be mitigated by heating for 40 minutes following the last addition of H₂O₂.
Using photometric tubes for color development can minimize the need for additional plastic or glassware, but it is crucial to mix immediately and thoroughly.
7.4.3. Micronutrient Analysis (Wet Digestion): Complete recovery of micronutrient cations (Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu) in plant tissues with high silica content (e.g., wheat, barley, rice, sugarcane) cannot be achieved through dry ashing. Therefore, these materials should undergo wet digestion using HNO₃-HClO₄, as adapted from Rashid (1986). This digestion method can also determine other elements, such as P, K, Ca, Mg, and Na.
Add 1 L of concentrated HNO3 to 500 mL of concentrated HClO4.
Weigh 1 g of dry and ground plant material, then transfer it quantitatively into a 100-mL Pyrex digestion tube.
Add 10 mL of a nitric acid-perchloric acid mixture (2:1 ratio) and allow it to stand overnight or until the vigorous reaction phase is complete.
Place small, short-stemmed funnels in the mouths of the tubes to facilitate acid reflux.
After the preliminary digestion, place the tubes in a cold block digester, then gradually raise the temperature to 150 °C for 1 hour.
Place U-shaped glass rods under each funnel to allow the exit of volatile vapors.
Slowly increase the temperature until all traces of HNO3 disappear, then remove the U-shaped glass rods.
Raise the temperature to 235 °C. When dense white fumes of HClO4 appear in the tubes, continue digestion for an additional 30 minutes.
Lift the tube rack out of the block digester, cool for a few minutes, and carefully add a few drops of deionized (DI) water through the funnel.
After the vapors condense, add DI water in small increments to wash down the walls of the tubes and funnels.
Bring the solution in each tube to volume, mix thoroughly, and then leave undisturbed for a few hours.
Each batch of samples for digestion should include at least one reagent blank (with no plant material).
Operate the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer or Flame Photometer according to the instructions provided for the equipment.
Run a series of suitable standards and draw a calibration curve.
Decant the supernatant liquid and analyze Zn, Fe, Mn, and Cu in the aliquots using the Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, Ca and Mg by titration with EDTA, and K and Na by Flame Photometer.
Calculate the concentrations of the supernatant liquid according to the calibration curve.
Heated mixtures of HClO4 and organic matter (OM) may explode violently. To avoid this hazard, take the following precautions: (a) do not add HClO4 to a hot solution containing organic matter; (b) always pre-treat samples containing organic matter with HNO3 before adding HClO4.
The filtrate may be capped and refrigerated overnight.
Samples should be allowed to equilibrate to room temperature before analysis.
For the release of mineral elements from plant tissues, dry ashing and wet oxidation are the two widely adopted methods. Critical factors in wet digestion procedures include the selection of the digestion vessel, temperature control, time, the digestion mixture, and final volume. The choice of digestion vessel depends on the elements of interest and the heat source. Time and temperature are interrelated and dependent on the digestion mixture. Wet oxidation employs oxidizing acids such as HNO3-H2SO4-HClO4 (tri-acid mixture) or HNO3-HClO4 (di-acid). The use of HClO4 avoids volatilization losses of P, K, and S and provides a clear solution, while H2SO4 helps complete oxidation. The wet oxidation method is easier, less time-consuming, and more convenient.
Digestion Setup: The digestion apparatus includes a digestion tube, an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer, and a block digester. The tri-acid mixture consists of concentrated HNO3, H2SO4, and HClO4 in a 10:1:4 ratio. After mixing, allow the solution to cool.
Weigh 0.5-1.0 g of dry and ground plant material (0.15 mm) into a 300-mL calibrated digestion tube (or a 150-mL conical flask).
Add 5 mL of concentrated H2SO4 (in a fume hood), swirl carefully, and place the tubes in a rack.
Position the rack in the block digester (or on a hot plate), and place a glass funnel in the neck of the tubes. Gradually increase the temperature to about 145 °C for 1 hour.
Add 5 mL of the tri-acid mixture and heat it to 240 °C for an additional hour, and if possible, allow it to sit overnight to prevent excessive foaming.
Filter the solution through Whatman No. 42 filter paper and adjust the volume to 50 mL.
Determine the concentrations of Fe, Mn, Cu, Zn, Cd, Ni, Pb, Co, and Cr using an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer.
Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (without plant material).
The initial stage of digestion should take at least 40 minutes, preferably longer, to ensure that the HNO3 can effectively oxidize all easily oxidizable materials. Insufficient time may lead to explosions.
As an additional precaution, H2SO4 is included to dilute the HClO4 in the final stage.
Regularly clean the fume hood and chimney, as condensed HClO4 could potentially cause a fire. A centrifugal ventilator is recommended.
Sodium nitrite is used to reduce insoluble higher manganese oxides that may form.
Mix concentrated HNO3 and HClO4 in a 9:4 ratio, and allow it to cool.
Weigh 0.5-1.0 g of dried and ground plant material into a 300-mL calibrated digestion tube (or a 150-mL conical flask).
Add 5 mL of concentrated HNO3 (in the fume hood), swirl carefully, and place the tubes in a rack.
Cover the calibrated digestion tube with a glass funnel and let it sit for about 6-8 hours.
After pre-digestion, add 10 mL of the di-acid mixture and swirl carefully.
Place the tube rack in the block digester and insert a glass funnel in the neck of the tubes. Gradually increase the temperature setting to about 180-200 °C until dense white fumes are produced, leaving transparent white residues.
Remove the tube rack from the block digester, carefully place it on a holder, and allow the tubes to cool to room temperature.
Filter the solution through Whatman No. 1 filter paper and adjust the volume to 50 mL.
Each batch of samples for digestion should include at least one reagent blank (without plant material).
Weigh 0.3-0.5 g of dried and processed plant material into MF/HF vessels suitable for microwave use.
Add 3 mL of concentrated HNO3 (in the fume hood), swirl carefully, then add 3 mL of concentrated H2O2, followed by 0.5 mL of concentrated HCl. Place the vessels into the rotor of the microwave.
Set the microwave system to 100 °C per vessel, with a ramp time of 10 minutes, a hold time of 10 minutes, and allow to cool for 30 minutes.
After cooling, filter the solution through Whatman No. 42 filter paper and adjust the volume to 50 mL.
Note that microwave digestion procedures require the use of specially designed ovens to handle acid fumes.
Ensure that microwave exhaust is directed to a scrubber before being released into the fume exhaust system.
Special safety precautions are necessary for microwave digestion; consult the manufacturer's specifications for details.
Calcium and magnesium can be determined in the di-acid digest of plant samples using either AAS or Versenate titration. When using AAS, lanthanum (La) must be added to the sample; the addition of 0.1-1.0% La prevents interference from Al, Be, P, Si, Ti, V, and Zn.
The microwave oven should be routinely checked for leakage using an electromagnetic monitor.
The digestion vessel carousel should be rotated during the digestion period to ensure that all samples are subjected to the same microwave flux.
After HNO3 digestion, samples must be cooled before adding H2O2 to prevent excessive frothing due to the reaction between H2O2 and hot acid digest.
Feel free to let me know if you need further adjustments or additional information!
Screw caps are used to provide reflux action.
Reagents should be added to the samples in the fume hood.
Nitric acid is used in most wet-oxidation procedures. The addition of sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄) raises the digestion temperature, while perchloric acid (HClO₄) or 30% hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) are used to increase the speed of the reaction and ensure complete digestion.
Most wet-digestion procedures can be completed using covered beakers on hot plates; however, digestion blocks are preferred due to enhanced temperature control.
Wet-ashing is recommended for plant materials that are high in silicon (Si).
Wet-ashing results in higher iron (Fe) and aluminum (Al) values compared to dry-ashing.
Silicon (Si), in the form of silicon dioxide (SiO₂), is extracted from plant samples and converted into silicic acid (H₃SiO₄) during the oxidation of organic material, which involves the elimination of carbon (C) through digestion with hydrogen peroxide (H₂O₂) under alkaline conditions. The H₃SiO₄ can be determined colorimetrically by reacting with molybdate. The blue and yellow analyses methods are usually distinguished. The method presented follows the description provided by Korndörfer et al. (2004), who expanded on the method of Elliot et al. (1991).
Dissolve 50 g of granular NaOH in 50 mL of deionized (DI) water. Let the solution cool to room temperature and store it in a plastic bottle.
Dissolve 100 g of (NH₄)₆Mo₇O₂₄·4H₂O in 500 mL of DI water.
Adjust the pH to 7–8 using 5 N NaOH and bring the volume to 1 L. Transfer the solution into a plastic bottle and store it in the refrigerator.
Dilute 500 mL of concentrated HCl in DI water, mix well, allow it to cool, and bring it to a final volume of 500 mL in a plastic bottle (polyethylene).
Dissolve 75 g of (COOH)₂·2H₂O in DI water, and bring the volume to 1 L.
As an alternative to oxalic acid solution, acetic acid solution (CH₃COOH), 200 g/L can be used. Dissolve 20 g of CH₃COOH in 100 mL of DI water.
Using the Merck Titrisol® Silicon standard (1000 mg solution of SiCl₄ in 14% NaOH; Merck-I.N.: 109947), open the capsule and allow the Si solution to flow into a 1 L volume. Rinse the capsule thoroughly with DI water to ensure complete transfer. Fill with DI water to make the stock solution. Note that this is not a 1000 ppm solution!
Add 25 mL of the stock solution to a 500 mL volumetric flask and bring it to volume with DI water. This diluted stock solution contains 50 ppm Si and must be prepared fresh as it cannot be stored.
Mix and spread a finely ground plant sample in a thin layer on a sheet of paper or plastic until it appears uniform.
Take a representative sub-sample of about 1 g by systematically withdrawing at least 10 small portions from all parts of the sample with a spatula, and place them into a plastic vial.
Dry the sub-sample at 60 °C in an oven overnight, then cool it in a desiccator.
Weigh 0.1 g of dry, ground plant material into 100-mL polypropylene tubes (e.g., round centrifuge tubes).
Add 2 mL of the 500 g/L H₂O₂ solution (under the fume hood, using plastic gloves) and agitate for a few seconds with the magnetic stirrer.
Add 3 mL of the 500 g/L NaOH solution and agitate again.
4. Place the tubes in an 85 °C water bath for 1 hour, taking care to avoid potential spills.
5. Once the sample has stopped releasing gas, secure the stoppers on the tubes and place them in an autoclave for 1 hour at 123 °C and 1.5 bar (150 kPa).
6. If the plant material does not appear to be completely digested, add another 1 mL of 500 g/L H₂O₂ solution and return the samples to the autoclave for an additional hour.
7. Add 45 mL of deionized (DI) water.
8. Transfer the extracts into labeled plastic cups. Allow the samples to sit until the residues settle at the bottom of the cups.
1. Pipette a 1-mL aliquot of the supernatant extract solution into a 50-mL plastic cup.
2. Add 19 mL of DI water (for samples with low silicon content, 2 mL of supernatant may be used, in which case only 18 mL of DI water should be added).
3. Prepare a series of standard solutions from the diluted stock solution (50 ppm) as follows: Dilute 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 mL into a 50-mL flask and bring to volume with DI water.
4. Pipette a 20-mL aliquot of each standard into a 50-mL plastic cup.
5. To the samples and standards, add 1 mL of 500 g/L HCl solution and 2 mL of ammonium heptamolybdate solution. Shake carefully. Depending on the concentration of silicon, a more or less intense yellow color will develop.
6. After 5-10 minutes, add 2 mL of oxalic acid solution and shake again gently.
Note that the amount of added HCl should be proportional to the amount of supernatant extract solution withdrawn, as silicon complexation and yellow color development do not occur under alkaline conditions.
7. Measure the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples on the spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 410 nm.
8. Prepare a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the respective silicon concentration.
9. Determine the silicon concentration in unknown samples using the calibration curve.
Be aware that the yellow color is not very stable and will begin to fade after just 15 minutes.
For quality control, a standard sample (such as wheat or rice chaff) should be analyzed every 20th sample, and analyses should be repeated if the deviation from the originally measured silicon content exceeds 5%.
Water sampling and analysis are crucial in agricultural and environmental applications for assessing the quality of water treatment processes, distribution systems, or water supply sources. Thus, a water sampling program begins with the collection of samples that accurately represent the characteristics of the bulk material and are manageable in the laboratory while still providing reliable test results. A significant source of error in obtaining water quality information occurs during sampling; over 50% of faulty data in laboratory test results arise from sampling errors rather than laboratory analysis. Much of the following information is based on standard methods for the examination of waters and wastewaters (APHA, 1998).
Containers should be inspected for cleanliness, ensuring they are strong and durable to prevent breakage during transit and that the cap seals securely without leaking.
Containers must not contain any compounds for which the samples will be analyzed.
Containers must be suitable for sampling water.
The size of the containers must be appropriate.
Containers should be made of high-density polyethylene or glass with Teflon® lid liners for most analyses.
Rubber and cork stoppers must be avoided to minimize contamination risks.
Rinse the sampling device and the bottle thoroughly with deionized (DI) water or with the sample itself, discarding the rinse water into the effluent.
If solid matter is adhered to the container, use a suitable brush and cleanser for a pre-wash before rinsing (note that soaps are not appropriate, as they may remain in the container).
The suitability of the cleaning procedure should be regularly verified by filling a cleaned container with distilled or ion exchange water and then analyzing it for the target contaminants. If no contaminants are detected, the cleaning procedure is confirmed to be adequate.
For certain target analyses, specific cleaning procedures are recommended. For example, when analyzing nitrates, the container should not be rinsed with nitric acid, and for chloride analysis, it should not be rinsed with hydrochloric acid.
Containers can generally be reused if they are cleaned with a non-phosphate detergent, rinsed with hot tap water, followed by a rinse with dilute acid, and then re-rinsed with tap water, distilled, or ion exchange water, and allowed to air dry.
Choice between manual or automatic sampling equipment.
Location of the sampling site (indoors, outdoors, or difficult access).
Whether the sampler installation is temporary or permanent.
Availability of power and compressed air.
Multiple samplers or automatic composite samplers.
Chilled cool-boxes for sample preservation.
Filtration apparatus for sample processing.
Adequate troubleshooting equipment for minor repairs.
Water samples must be placed in appropriately labeled containers, preferably clear glass (use waterproof ink for labels). Ensure the bottle is labeled so it can be identified throughout the transport and analytical process.
The laboratory's requirements for analysis typically dictate a minimum volume of 500 mL, with one liter being preferable.
Rinse the bottle at least four times with the water to be sampled.
Do not dispose of the rinse water in a manner that may contaminate or mix with the sample.
Collect five sub-samples (100-200 mL each) to constitute the full sample.
Fill the bottle to the top, leaving little or no air space, and seal it tightly with the cap.
Record all relevant information about the water samples on the sample container and in a field logbook, including the sample number, site code, date and time of collection, parameters to be tested, sampler’s name, and any other pertinent details to avoid mix-ups. Each sample should also receive a laboratory number.
Create a sketch of your sampling field, labeling sampled areas to match the sample containers. This serves as a record of which recommendations apply to each area—do not rely solely on memory.
Complete an information sheet, writing clearly and using a pencil for clarity. The more information you provide with each sample, the more accurate your recommendations will be.
Use plastic bottles for inorganic and metals analyses, and glass bottles for organic samples.
Sterile containers are required for bacteriological analysis.
If a preservative is used, filter for metals.
Each time you collect a sample, ensure it is recorded on the field data sheet.
Clearly mark and identify the separate sample containers from each location.
Containers must be closed until ready for analysis.
All water samples should be stored in chilled cool boxes prior to dispatch to the laboratory.
Stream: Sample taken from the main stream flow.
Stock Drinking Water: Sample taken from near the edge.
Dam: If water is pumped from a dam and the sample is not taken from the outlet side of the pump, take the sample from near where the suction side of the pump draws water. To assess changes in quality throughout the dam, where water may settle into well-defined layers, it may be necessary to sample from specific layers separately. The practicality of sampling from specific depths should be considered, with samples taken from the upper layers first.
Underground Source: When water is drawn from an underground source, such as a bore or well, this is often the only way to sample. Allow the pump to run for sufficient time to flush out water that has been in the pipe, then take samples at intervals of 5-10 minutes from the first off-take point (e.g., tap, trough, or sprinkler head).
Reticulated Source: If the water is drawn from a reticulated source (e.g., irrigation scheme, city, or town water supply), check with the local supplying authority, as they may have analytical data on the chemical and other characteristics of the water.
Water Irrigation: For water used for irrigation or piped for livestock or domestic purposes, the simplest approach is generally to let the pump do the sampling.
Grab Samples: These are single samples collected at a specific spot over a short period of time not exceeding 15 minutes. They represent the composition of the source at the time and place of collection. Grab samples are required for test parameters that must be measured immediately after collection, for tests needing the entire contents of a single sample container, or for tests where the parameter may change over time. Examples of test parameters requiring grab samples include temperature, pH, residual chlorine, and dissolved oxygen.
Composite Samples: These are obtained by collecting an appropriate number of grab samples at equal intervals or proportional to flow. Flow-proportional composite samples are collected when the flow and waste characteristics are continually changing. This single sample reflects the average conditions of a point-source during an interval. The nature of the composite sample requires that the tested parameters remain stable in the container for the duration of sampling, often 24 hours (usually requiring refrigeration to 4 °C).
The physical and chemical characteristics of a water sample can change during transport and storage. Therefore, protection and preservation methods are essential, as they only slow the inevitable chemical and biological changes that occur after collection. Some parameters change more quickly than others and need to be analyzed on-site.
Protecting and preserving samples is crucial for obtaining quality results (see Appendix No. 18 for more details).
Sodium Thiosulfate: Added to achieve a final concentration of 0.008% for the removal of chlorine.
Copper Sulfate or Mercuric Chloride: Employed to halt biological activity.
Zinc Acetate: Used to trap sulfides.
pH Adjustment: Proper pH adjustment, either above 12 SU (Standard Units) using sodium hydroxide (NaOH) or below 2 SU using hydrochloric acid (HCl), sulfuric acid (H₂SO₄), or nitric acid (HNO₃), depending on the intended analyte, can effectively inactivate biological processes.
Analysts must be aware that acidifying nitrate-nitrite samples with HNO₃ or preserving sulfate samples with H₂SO₄ will invalidate analyses. Adequate notation must be made by the sampler.
Samples that are not preserved must be analyzed immediately.
Upon receipt at the water analysis laboratory, water samples should be checked against the accompanying information list. The sample number and date of sampling must be written on the container. All sample information should be entered into a register, and each sample should receive a laboratory number.
Samples should be kept refrigerated or on ice in a cooler (but not allowed to freeze) as soon as possible. Cold and dark conditions help slow changes caused by the growth of microorganisms.
Generally, the shorter the time between collection and analysis, the more reliable the results will be.
Laboratory personnel routinely exposed to water samples that may contain live microorganisms are encouraged to protect themselves from water-borne illnesses by wearing clean disposable gloves and washing their hands frequently.
Care must be taken when handling hazardous reagents, using protective clothing and safety goggles.
Ensuring that the sample taken is truly representative of the water being analyzed.
Using proper sampling techniques.
Protecting and preserving the samples until they can be analyzed in a timely manner.
Both water and wastewater should be checked for chemical, physical (such as turbidity and solid matter), and biological contamination before use to avoid environmental pollution, as many diseases can be transmitted to plants, animals, and humans through contaminated water.
A reading above 7 indicates alkalinity.
A reading below 7 indicates acidity.
Alkalinity is increased by caustic substances from industry (such as KOH and NaOH), soil additives in agriculture (such as lime, Ca(OH)₂), superphosphate (a mixture of Ca(H₂PO₄)₂ and CaSO₄), and soaps and detergents. Natural acidity arises from compounds like CO₂ (g), HPO₄²⁻, H₂PO₄⁻, H₂S, Fe, other acidic metal ions, proteins, and organic acids. Increases in acidity can result from acids used in industry, acid mine drainage, and acid rain.
A. Potassium Chloride (KCl), 0.01 M: Dissolve 0.745 g of KCl in deionized (DI) water and bring to a final volume of 1 L.
Dry approximately 15 g of potassium dihydrogen phthalate (C₈H₅O₄K) in an oven at 110 °C for 3 hours.
Dissolve 10.12 g of C₈H₅O₄K in freshly boiled DI water and bring to a final volume of 1 L.
Dry about 5 g of potassium dihydrogen phosphate (KH₂PO₄) and sodium hydrogen phosphate (Na₂HPO₄) in an oven at temperatures between 110 °C and 130 °C overnight.
Dissolve 3.388 g of KH₂PO₄ and 3.533 g of Na₂HPO₄ in freshly boiled DI water and bring to a final volume of 1 L.
The DI water should be freshly boiled, cooled, and free of CO₂.
C. Distilled Water (DI): Boil and cool DI water to achieve a conductivity of less than 2 μmhos/cm.
Calibrate the pH meter (refer to Box No. 3 for more details).
Take a 50-mL water sample in a 100-mL flask. Immerse the combined electrode about 3 cm deep into the sample and take the reading after 30 seconds.
Remove the electrode from the sample, rinse it thoroughly with DI water in a separate beaker, and carefully dry any excess water with a tissue.
Ensure the combined electrode contains a saturated KCl solution and some solid KCl.
If the pH meter and combined electrodes will not be used for extended periods, follow the manufacturer's storage instructions. Keep electrodes wet by returning them to a storage solution, generally having a conductivity greater than 4000 μmhos/cm, such as tap water (a better substitute than DI water). Use pH 4.01 buffer for a single-glass electrode; saturated KCl is preferred for calomel and Ag/AgCl reference electrodes, as well as for combination electrodes.
If sufficient water is available for testing, discard the sample used for pH determination, as it may be affected by slight leakage from saturated potassium chloride-calomel reference electrodes. If water is limited, determine electrical conductivity (EC) first, then pH; the same sample may subsequently be used for cation-anion analyses, except for K and Cl.
ACS-grade chemicals are generally satisfactory for preparing buffer solutions.
Ensure complete dissolution when preparing buffer solutions from solid salts.
9.2. Electrical Conductivity: Electrical conductivity (EC) measures the ability of a solution to carry an electric current, indicating the concentration of soluble salts in the sample at a specific temperature. The EC measurement can be influenced by dissolved CO₂, turbidity, temperature, and the nature of various ions, along with their relative concentrations in the water.
EC is measured in the field or laboratory using a conductivity meter, which operates on the principle of a Wheatstone bridge that assesses the resistance of the solution between two parallel platinum electrodes. Conductivities can range from less than 0.02 dS/m for distilled water to more than 20 dS/m for highly saline waters.
Potassium Chloride Solution (KCl), 0.01 N: Dry about 2-3 g of KCl in an oven at 110 °C for at least 2 hours.
Calibration: Calibrate the conductivity meter according to the manufacturer’s instructions (see Box No. 4 for more details).
Rinsing: Rinse the conductivity cell thoroughly with deionized (DI) water and carefully dry any excess water with a tissue.
Sample Preparation: Rinse the conductivity cell with the measured solution a few times.
Place approximately 75 mL of the water sample in a 100 mL glass beaker, and then insert the clean, dried conductivity cell into the beaker.
Take the reading. Note that the display may require some time to stabilize before providing an accurate reading.
After taking the reading, remove the conductivity cell from the beaker, rinse it thoroughly with DI water, and dry any excess water with a tissue.
Instructions: It is essential to follow the manufacturer's instructions.
Cleaning: Clean the conductivity cell if it becomes contaminated.
Reference Temperature: The reference temperature should be 25 °C, and results should be expressed in deci-Siemens per meter (dS/m). If measurements are conducted at a different temperature, correct the results to 25 °C. Verify the accuracy of the EC meter using a 0.01 N KCl solution, which should read 1.413 dS/m at 25 °C.
Units of Measurement: Record readings in either milli-mhos per centimeter (mmhos/cm) or deci-Siemens per meter (dS/m). The use of the unit deci-Siemens is preferred, as both units are equivalent: 1 dS/cm = 1 mmho/cm.
Total Dissolved Solids (TDS) are defined as the substances that remain after the evaporation and drying of a water sample. This remaining fraction is approximately equivalent to the total content of dissolved and suspended matter in the sample. Non-filterable residue corresponds to Total Suspended Solids (TSS), while filterable residue represents TDS.
The measured TDS concentration should typically be higher than the calculated value, as significant contributors may be missing from the calculation. If the measured value is lower than the calculated value, all values should be considered suspect. Conversely, if the measured value exceeds the calculated value, the low ion sum is questionable, and specific constituents should be reanalyzed.
A well-mixed, measured portion of the sample is filtered through a standard glass-fiber filter. The filtrate is then evaporated to dryness in a pre-weighed dish and dried to a constant weight at 180 °C. The increase in dish weight corresponds to the total dissolved solids.
Evaporating Dishes: Made of porcelain, platinum, or high-silica glass.
Desiccators: Equipped with a desiccant containing a color indicator for moisture concentration.
Analytical Balance: Capable of weighing to 0.001 g.
Filtration Apparatus: Including glass-fiber filters and a suction flask.
Place the evaporating dishes in an oven at 180 °C for at least 1 hour. Allow them to cool and store them in desiccators until needed. Weigh immediately before use.
Prepare the glass-fiber disc by placing it, wrinkled side up, in the filtration apparatus. Apply vacuum and wash the disc with three successive 20 mL washings of DI water. Continue suction to remove all traces of water and discard the washings.
Add an aliquot of the sample to yield between 2.5 and 200 mg of dried residue.
Filter a measured volume of the well-mixed water sample through the glass-fiber filter.
Wash with three successive 10 mL volumes of DI water, allowing for complete drainage between each wash.
Continue suction for approximately 3 minutes after filtration is complete.
Dry for at least 1 hour in an oven at 180 °C. Cool in desiccators and weigh (Wtd+s).
Repeat the cycle of drying, desiccating, and weighing until a constant weight is obtained, or until the weight loss between successive weighings is less than 4% or 0.5 mg, whichever is less.
Total Suspended Solids (TSS) refer to the dry weight of the material that is removed from a measured volume of water sample by filtration through a standard filter. The test is primarily empirical and is not subject to the usual criteria of accuracy. To achieve reproducibility and comparability of results, close attention to procedural details is required, particularly regarding filter characteristics and the time and temperature of drying.
Place a filter disc on the filter holder. Assemble the filter holder in the suction flask apparatus, connect it to a vacuum source, and apply vacuum.
Wash the filter disc with three successive 20-mL portions of deionized (DI) water. Continue to apply vacuum for 2-3 minutes after the water has passed through the filter. Discard the filtrate.
Remove the filter paper from the membrane filter funnel or Buchner funnel and place it on a supporting surface in a drying oven.
Place the crucibles in the drying oven. The oven should be maintained at 105 °C, and drying should continue for at least 1 hour.
Cool the filters and crucibles in desiccators and weigh them on an analytical balance.
Repeat the cycle of drying, desiccating, and weighing until the weight loss between two successive operations is less than 0.5 mg.
Store filters and crucibles in desiccators until required.
Remove the filter disc and crucible from the desiccators and weigh (Wtf+c).
Place the filter in the filter holder and assemble the filter holder in the suction flask apparatus. Connect it to the vacuum source and apply vacuum.
Wet the filter with a few drops of DI water to seat it.
Shake the sample vigorously and measure out 100 mL in a graduated cylinder or volumetric flask. Pour this portion of the sample into the filter funnel, being careful not to disturb the placement of the filter disc.
Rinse the measuring flask or cylinder with a small quantity of DI water. If the sample has very low suspended material, a larger volume of sample may be used.
Once filtration is complete, carefully remove the filter disc from the filter holder with tweezers (or remove the crucible from its supporting socket with tongs) and place it in the drying oven.
Dry for at least 1 hour at 105 °C. Cool in desiccators and weigh (Wtf+c+s).
Repeat the drying, desiccating, and weighing cycle until the weight loss between two successive weighings is less than 0.5 mg.
Record the final weight obtained.
It is necessary to report the specifications followed, e.g., TSS at ... °C, type of filter, and pore size or number.
Non-homogeneous particulates such as leaves, sticks, and lumps of fecal matter should be excluded from the sample. Excess residue on the filter may retain water and may require prolonged drying.
Volatile material in a sample can distort results.
In water and wastewater, the forms of nitrogen (N) of greatest interest are nitrate nitrogen (NO3-N), nitrite nitrogen (NO2-N), ammonia (NH3), and organic forms of nitrogen. These nitrogen forms are interchangeable and are components of the nitrogen cycle. Ammonia is naturally present in surface water and wastewater, but its concentration is generally low in groundwater because it is adsorbed by soil particles and clay and is not readily leached from soils. Nitrate in groundwater poses a major environmental and public health concern, as nitrates are converted to nitrites in the intestines. Once absorbed into the bloodstream, nitrites prevent hemoglobin from transporting oxygen, though older children have an enzyme that can restore hemoglobin function. High levels of NO3-N in drinking water (greater than 10 ppm) are linked to health problems, such as methemoglobinemia. Thus, while water with high NO3-N levels should be avoided for human consumption, it can be suitable for irrigation as an additional source of nutrients.
Ammonium nitrogen and the combined total of NO3-N and NO2-N are determined by steam distillation. Heavy magnesium oxide (MgO) is used for NH4, and Devarda’s alloy is used for NO3. The distillate is collected in saturated boric acid (H3BO3) and titrated to a pH of 5.0 with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4).
Magnesium Oxide (MgO): Heat heavy magnesium oxide in a muffle furnace at 600-700 °C for 2 hours, cool in a desiccator containing KOH pellets, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.
Devarda’s Alloy: Prepare a mixture of 50% copper (Cu), 45% aluminum (Al), and 5% zinc (Zn) by ball-milling the reagent-grade Devarda’s Alloy until it passes a 100-mesh sieve (0.150 mm) with at least 75% passing a 300-mesh sieve (0.05 mm).
Saturated Boric Acid Solution (H3BO3): Dissolve 500 g of H3BO3 in 3 L of deionized (DI) water in a 5-L container. Swirl vigorously and let it sit overnight. There should always be solid H3BO3 at the bottom of the flask.
Tris Solution (C4H11NO3, 0.01 N): Dry reagent-grade Tris in an oven at 80 °C for 3 hours, cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle. Dissolve 1.2114 g of Tris in DI water and bring to a 1-L volume.
Sulfuric Acid Solution (H2SO4, 0.01 N): Add 28 mL of concentrated H2SO4 to about 600-800 mL of DI water in a 1-L flask. Mix well, let it cool, and bring to a 1-L volume. This forms a 1 N H2SO4 stock solution. From this, pipette 10 mL into a 1-L flask and dilute with DI water to create a 0.01 N H2SO4 solution.
(NH4)2SO4 and 8.6624 g of KNO3 in DI water, and bring to a 1-L volume. This solution contains 1.2 g of NH4-N and 1.2 g of NO3-N per liter (Stock Solution). Prepare a diluted standard solution by diluting 50 mL of the stock solution to 1 L using 2 M KCl solution. A 20-mL aliquot of this diluted stock solution contains 1.2 mg of NH4-N and 1.2 mg of NO3-N.
The distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust the steam rate to 7-8 mL of distillate per minute.
Ensure that water flows through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to maintain the distillate temperature below 22 °C.
Pipette 20 mL of water or wastewater sample into a 100-mL distillation flask.
Pipette 1 mL of saturated H₃BO₃ solution and 1 mL of deionized (DI) water into two separate 50-mL beakers (duplicate beakers).
Place the first beaker beneath the condenser tip, ensuring the tip touches the surface of the solution.
Using a calibrated spoon, add about 0.2 g of heavy MgO to the distillation flask.
Immediately attach the distillation flask to the distillation unit using a clamp.
Start the distillation and continue for 3 minutes, then lower the dish to allow the distillate to drain freely into the Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker.
After 4 minutes, when 35 mL of distillate or more is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask (this is the first distillate).
Each distillation should include at least two standards (pipette 20 mL of 1.2 mg NH₄-N from the diluted stock solution) and two blanks (pipette 20 mL of 2 KCl solution). The recovery of NH₄-N should be at least 96%.
Place the second beaker beneath the condenser tip, ensuring the tip touches the surface of the solution.
Immediately add 0.2 g of Devarda’s alloy to the same distillation flask using a calibrated spoon, then reattach it to the distillation unit with a clamp and start distilling.
After 4 minutes, when 35 mL of distillate or more is collected, turn off the steam supply and remove the distillation flask (this is the second distillate).
Wash the tip of the condenser into the Pyrex evaporating dish or beaker with a small amount of DI water.
Each distillation should include at least two standards (pipette 20 mL of 1.2 mg NO₃-N from the diluted stock solution) and two blanks (pipette 20 mL of DI water). The recovery of NO₃-N should be at least 96%.
Titrate the first distillate (for ammonia) and the second distillate (for nitrate) separately to pH 5 with standardized 0.01 N H₂SO₄ using an Auto-Titrator.
After finishing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, burette tip, and combined electrode into the dish.
Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the water sample, attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the distillation unit, and place a 100-mL empty beaker beneath the condenser tip. Turn off the cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket) and steam out for 90 seconds. Steaming out is only done between distillations for different samples, not between ammonium (using MgO) and nitrate (using Devarda’s alloy) in the same sample.
If possible, NH₄-N and NO₃-N should be determined immediately after sampling. If analysis cannot be done immediately, water and wastewater samples may be kept refrigerated at 4 °C.
All water for reagents and dilution should be ammonia-free. DI water is usually sufficient.
Filter paper may contain traces of NH₄, so discard the first 20-25 mL of filtrate.
Never use acid preservation for samples to be analyzed for NO₃ or NH₄.
The Kjeldahl procedure is a reliable method for estimating nitrogen content in water or wastewater samples. This procedure involves digestion and distillation. The sample is digested in concentrated H₂SO₄ with a catalyst mixture to raise the boiling temperature and promote the conversion of organic nitrogen to ammonium nitrogen. This is then obtained through steam distillation, using excess NaOH to raise the pH. The distillate is collected in saturated H₃BO₃ and titrated with dilute H₂SO₄ to pH 5.0 (Bremner and Mulvaney, 1982).
Grind reagent-grade chemicals separately and mix them. If the mixture is caked, grind it using a porcelain pestle and mortar to pass through a 60-mesh screen (0.250 mm), taking care not to breathe selenium (Se) dust or allow Se to come into contact with skin.
Dissolve 400 g of NaOH in deionized (DI) water, transfer it to a 1-L heavy-walled Pyrex flask, let it cool, and bring it to volume.
Add 500 g of H₃BO₃ to a 5-L flask.
Add 3 L of DI water and swirl vigorously.

Pipette 10 mL of the Stock Solution into a 1-L flask and bring to volume with DI water. This solution contains 0.01 N H₂SO₄.
in an oven at 100 °C for 2 hours, cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.
in DI water and bring to a 1-L volume. This solution contains 1.2 g NH₄-N/L (Stock Solution).
Pipette a 20-mL aliquot of the water sample into a 100-mL calibrated digestion tube.
Add about 3.0 – 3.5 g of the catalyst mixture, a few pumice boiling granules, and 10 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ (in a fume hood), then swirl carefully. Place the tubes in a rack and insert a glass funnel in the neck of the tube.
Place the tube rack in the block digester and slowly increase the temperature setting to about 370 - 380 °C. The H₂SO₄ should condense about halfway up the tube neck; when the solution clears, continue heating for about 3 hours.
Lift the tube rack out of the block digester, carefully place it on a rack holder, and let the tubes cool to room temperature.
Slowly add about 15 mL of DI water to the tubes, cool, and bring to volume with DI water.
Each batch of samples for digestion should contain at least one reagent blank (DI water sample) and one chemical standard (DI water sample, pipette 1 mL of the Stock Solution).
Before starting a batch for distillation, the distillation unit should be steamed out for at least 10 minutes. Adjust the steam rate to 7 – 8 mL of distillate per minute. Water should flow through the condenser jacket at a rate sufficient to keep the distillate temperature below 22 °C.
Calibrate the pH meter with buffer solutions of pH 7.0 (buffer) and 4.0 (sensitivity) after setting for temperature. Then, standardize the 0.01 N H₂SO₄ in the Auto-Titrator by titrating three separate 10-mL aliquots of the primary standard, 0.01 N Tris solution, to pH 5.0. The titrations should agree within 0.03 mL; if not, titrate further aliquots until agreement is found.
Dispense 1 mL of saturated H₃BO₃ solution and 1 mL of DI water into a 100-mL Pyrex evaporating dish, placing it underneath the condenser tip with the tip touching the solution surface.
Pipette a 20-mL aliquot into a 100-mL distillation flask, and add 10 mL of 10 N NaOH solution.
Immediately attach the flask to the distillation unit with a clamp, start distillation, and continue for 3 minutes, lowering the dish to allow the distillate to drain freely into it.
After 4 minutes, when about 35 mL of distillate is collected, turn off the steam supply and wash the tip of the condenser into the evaporating dish with a small amount of DI water.
Each distillation should contain at least two standards (pipette 10 mL of the digested water sample) and two blanks (pipette 10 mL of the digested water blank). The recovery of NH4-N should be at least 96%.
After completing the titration, wash the Teflon-coated magnetic stirring bar, the burette tip, and the combined electrode in a dish.
Between different samples, steam out the distillations. Disconnect the distillation flasks containing the digest sample and NaOH, and attach a 100-mL empty distillation flask to the distillation unit. Place a 100-mL empty beaker underneath the condenser tip, turn off the cooling water supply (drain the water from the condenser jacket), and steam out for 90 seconds.
Phosphorus compounds are present in fertilizers and many detergents. When they exceed critical levels in the soil, they are carried into surface waters, sewage, industrial waste, and storm runoff. Unlike nitrogen, inorganic phosphorus forms are highly reactive and do not readily leach through soils. High concentrations of phosphorus compounds may create secondary problems in water bodies where algal growth is usually limited by phosphorus. In such cases, the presence of additional phosphorus can stimulate algal productivity and enhance eutrophication.
Phosphorus occurs in natural waters and wastewaters primarily as phosphate. Groundwater rarely contains more than 0.1 mg/L of phosphate unless polluted by organic matter. Phosphorus is essential for the growth of organisms and can be the limiting nutrient for biological growth in aquatic environments.
Phosphorus can be determined using vanadomolybdo phosphoric acid colorimetric methods. In this process, ammonium molybdate and potassium antimony tartrate react with orthophosphate in an acidic medium to form a heteropoly acid known as phosphomolybdic acid, which is then reduced to an intensely colored molybdenum blue by ascorbic acid.
Dilute 148 mL of concentrated H2SO4 (in a fume hood) with deionized (DI) water, mix well, allow it to cool, and bring the total volume to 1 L.

(KH2PO4) in an oven at 105 °C for 1 hour. Cool in a desiccator and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.
Dissolve 2.197 g of the dried KH2PO4 in DI water to prepare a 1 L solution, which contains 500 ppm of phosphorus (Stock Solution).
Dilute 50 mL of the Stock Solution to a total volume of 250 mL with DI water, resulting in a solution containing 100 ppm phosphorus (Diluted Stock Solution).
Dilute 5, 10, 15, 20, and 25 mL of the Diluted Stock Solution to 500 mL in numbered flasks with DI water. These solutions will contain 1, 2, 3, 4, and 5 ppm of phosphorus, respectively.
Feel free to ask if you need any more adjustments or additional information!
Add the required amount of acid to all water samples to adjust the solution's pH to 5.0 (see Technical Remark No. 1).
Add 8 mL of Reagent B and dilute to a final volume of 50 mL with deionized (DI) water, mixing well.
Pipette 2 mL of each standard (1-5 ppm) and treat them as you would the samples.
Prepare a blank using only DI water and handle it the same way as the samples.
Measure the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples after 10 minutes using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 882 nm.
Construct a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the respective phosphorus (P) concentrations.
Determine the P concentration in the unknown samples using the calibration curve.
To acidify the water sample to pH 5.0 using 5 N H₂SO₄, take 10 mL of DI water and add 2-3 drops of phenolphthalein indicator. If a red color appears, add 5 N H₂SO₄ until the color disappears. Generally, adding 1 mL of 5 N H₂SO₄ is sufficient to acidify each 10 mL water sample.
If the sample solutions are too dark-colored for measurement against the highest standard, use a smaller volume of water and adjust calculations accordingly. Once the blue color has developed, the solution cannot be diluted.
Glassware used in P analysis should not be washed with detergents containing phosphorus, as most detergents do.
To ensure consistency, it is advisable to use the same cuvette for each absorbance reading on the spectrophotometer.
Interference: Arsenates (As) react with the molybdate (Mo) reagent, producing a blue color similar to that formed with phosphate. Concentrations as low as 0.1 mg As/L can interfere with the phosphate determination. Hexavalent chromium (Cr) and nitrites (NO₂) may cause a 3% to 15% reduction in results at concentrations of 1 mg/L and 10 mg/L, respectively. Sulfide (Na₂S) and silicate do not interfere at concentrations of 1.0 and 10 mg/L.
Organically-bound phosphorus and all phosphate forms are converted to orthophosphate through an acid-persulfate digestion. This digestion is necessary to release phosphorus from organic matter. The digested sample is analyzed for orthophosphate based on its reaction with a combined reagent consisting of ammonium molybdate, antimony potassium tartrate, and ascorbic acid, resulting in an intensely colored molybdenum blue.

Add DI water to bring the total volume to about 40 mL, then add 8 mL of Reagent B and bring to volume.
Pipette a suitable volume of each standard (0.2 – 2 ppm) and proceed as with the samples.
Also prepare a blank and follow the same procedure as for the samples.
After 10 minutes, read the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples using a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 882 nm.
Prepare a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the respective P concentrations.
Determine the P concentration in the unknown samples from the calibration curve.
Do not add HClO₄ to a hot solution containing high organic matter.
Always pre-treat samples containing organic matter with HNO₃ before adding HClO₄.
No interferences are typically observed from copper (Cu), iron (Fe), or silicon (Si). However, high concentrations of Fe can cause precipitation and subsequent loss of P.
Arsenate may interfere if present at concentrations higher than P.
Phosphate adsorbed on glass surfaces may affect measurements at low P levels. Using acid-washed glassware dedicated to this analysis can prevent this interference.
Although potassium (K) is relatively abundant, its concentration in natural freshwaters is usually less than 20 mg/L. Brines and seawater may contain up to 400 mg/L of K or more. Potassium in water can be determined by flame photometry, which is based on emission spectroscopy—this involves the excitation of electrons from a ground state to a higher energy state and the subsequent emission of light as they return to their original state.
Dissolve 1.907 g of dried KCl in deionized (DI) water and bring the total volume to 1 L. This solution contains 1000 ppm K (Stock Solution).
Prepare a series of standard solutions from the Stock Solution as follows: Dilute 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, and 20 mL of the Stock Solution to a final volume of 100 mL in numbered flasks with DI water. These solutions will contain 20, 40, 60, 80, 100, 150, and 200 ppm K, respectively.
Filter a portion of the water sample through Whatman No. 42 filter paper.
Follow the manufacturer’s instructions for operating the Flame Photometer.
Calibrate the Flame Photometer using a series of suitable K standards, with DI water as the blank sample.
Measure the water samples and take the emission reading at a wavelength of 767 nm. Record the readings.
Switch off the Flame Photometer according to the manufacturer's instructions.
Draw a calibration curve based on the readings.
Calculate K concentrations using the calibration curve. The atomic weight of K is 39.1.
Regularly check the performance of the photometer by analyzing some of the standard solutions and adjust the sensitivity as necessary.
If the K concentration exceeds the top standard, dilute the sample appropriately. If this dilution is of the original sample, multiply the result by the appropriate dilution factor.
Sodium interference can be neutralized by adding aluminum (Al) ions, typically in the form of aluminum nitrate.
Calcium (Ca) dissolves easily from almost all rocks and is, therefore, found in most waters. Magnesium (Mg) is relatively abundant in the Earth's crust and is a common constituent of natural water. Waters associated with granite or siliceous sand usually contain less than 10 mg of calcium per liter and less than 5 mg of magnesium per liter.
In contrast, waters from limestone areas may contain 30-100 mg Ca/L, while those associated with gypsiferous shale can contain several hundred milligrams per liter. Water in contact with dolomite or magnesium-rich limestone may have 10-50 mg/L of calcium, and water that has been in contact with deposits containing sulfates and chlorides of magnesium may contain several hundred milligrams per liter.
Calcium and magnesium contribute to the total hardness of water. The difference between total hardness and calcium concentration can be used to calculate magnesium concentration. Some calcium carbonate (CaCO3) is desirable in domestic waters, as it forms a protective coating in pipes that prevents corrosion.
EDTA-disodium salt solution is used to chelate calcium and magnesium. Calcium is separately estimated using the versenate method with ammonium purpurate (Murexide) as an indicator, ensuring the pH is sufficiently high so that magnesium precipitates largely as hydroxide. Thus, magnesium can be calculated by subtracting calcium from the total calcium plus magnesium content. Both cations can also be estimated using atomic absorption spectrophotometry.
A. Buffer Solution (NH4Cl-NH4OH) Dissolve 67.5 g of NH4Cl in 570 mL of concentrated NH4OH, transfer the solution to a 1-L flask, allow it to cool, and bring to volume.
B. Eriochrome Black Indicator Dissolve 0.5 g of eriochrome black and 4.5 g of hydroxylamine hydrochloride in 100 mL of 95% ethyl alcohol. Prepare a fresh batch every month.
C. Ethylene Diaminetetraacetic Acid Solution (EDTA), 0.01 N Dissolve 2 g of EDTA and 0.05 g of magnesium chloride (MgCl2) in deionized (DI) water, and bring to a 1-L volume.
D. Sodium Hydroxide Solution (NaOH), 2 N Dissolve 80 g of NaOH in about 800 mL of DI water, transfer the solution to a 1-L flask, cool, and bring to volume.
E. Ammonium Purpurate Indicator (C8H8N6O6) Mix 0.5 g of ammonium purpurate (Murexid) with 100 g of potassium sulfate (K2SO4).
Dry approximately 3 g of CaCO3 in an oven at 100 °C for 3 hours, cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered bottle.
Dissolve 0.5 g of dried CaCO3 in 10 mL of 3 N hydrochloric acid (HCl) and bring to a 1-L volume with DI water.
Alternative Preparation Standard stock can also be prepared by dissolving 0.735 g of calcium chloride dihydrate (CaCl2·2H2O) in DI water to make a 1-L solution.
Pipette a suitable aliquot of the water sample (10 mL) into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Dilute to 20-30 mL with DI water, add 2-3 mL of 2 N NaOH solution, and about 50 mg of ammonium purpurate indicator.
Titrate with 0.01 N EDTA. The color change should be from red to lavender or purple. Near the endpoint, add EDTA one drop every 10 seconds, as the color change is not instantaneous.
Pipette a suitable aliquot of the water sample (10 mL), dilute to 20-30 mL with DI water, then add 3-5 mL of buffer solution and a few drops of eriochrome black indicator.
Titrate with 0.01 N EDTA until the color changes from red to blue.
In order to standardize the EDTA solution used in the determination of calcium and magnesium...
The normality for calcium (Ca) determination is usually 3% to 5% higher than that for calcium and magnesium (Ca + Mg).
If an Atomic Absorption Spectrophotometer is used, a small aliquot of the water sample is sufficient to determine Ca and Mg concentrations.
Orthophosphate can precipitate calcium at the test pH. Strontium (Sr) and barium (Ba) may interfere with calcium determination, and alkalinity exceeding 300 mg/L can lead to an indistinct endpoint in hard waters. Under the test conditions, typical concentrations of the following ions do not interfere with calcium determination: Cu, Fe, Mn, Zn, Al, Pb, and Sn.
Low calcium intake can be associated with hypertension and cardiovascular disorders, as well as a link to osteoporosis. Drinking water may significantly contribute to the daily calcium requirement for individuals with low dietary calcium.
An average adult consumes approximately 480 mg of magnesium daily, with excess amounts rapidly expelled by the body. There is no established upper limit for magnesium in drinking water; however, it can pose risks for individuals with kidney disease, potentially leading to toxic reactions such as muscle weakness, coma, hypertension, and confusion.
Most water hardness is attributed to calcium and magnesium, which react with soap to form precipitates. This increases soap consumption and can lead to scale formation. Generally, a hardness value of less than 60 mg/L is considered soft, while values above 200 mg/L are categorized as very hard.
Carbonates (CO₃) and bicarbonates (HCO₃) in water can be determined by titrating a known volume of water with standard H₂SO₄ using phenolphthalein and methyl orange indicators. When the pH of a natural water sample exceeds 8.4, carbonate ions are usually present as sodium carbonate. The carbonate ion converts to bicarbonate, and the amount of acid used in the titration reflects the carbonate concentration.
Bicarbonate ions react with mineral acids, releasing carbon dioxide (CO₂) into the solution. Complete neutralization occurs at a pH of about 3.8, indicating the presence of bicarbonate ions. Thus, bicarbonate can be measured by titration with mineral acid to a pH of 3.8, either potentiometrically or using a CO₂-unaffected indicator like methyl orange. This indicator provides a clear color transition from green through grey (end-point) to red, eliminating the need for a matching buffer solution.
Pipettes: Graduated pipette, burette, magnetic stirrer, Erlenmeyer flasks.
Methyl Orange Indicator: Dissolve 0.1 g of methyl orange in 100 mL of deionized water to make a 0.1% solution.
Sulfuric Acid Solution (H₂SO₄): To prepare 0.01 N solution, add 28 mL of concentrated H₂SO₄ to 600-800 mL of deionized water in a 1-L flask, mix well, cool, and dilute to 1 L. From this stock solution, pipette 10 mL into another 1-L flask and dilute with deionized water.
Phenolphthalein Indicator: Dissolve 1 g of phenolphthalein in 100 mL of ethanol.
Pipette a suitable aliquot (10 mL) of the water sample into a wide-mouthed porcelain crucible or a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Add 1 drop of phenolphthalein indicator. If a pink color develops, titrate with 0.01 N H₂SO₄ from a burette, drop by drop, until the color disappears.
Continue titrating with 0.01 N H₂SO₄ after adding 2 drops of 0.1% methyl orange indicator until the solution turns orange.
Standard HCl is used because H₂SO₄ may cause turbidity from calcium sulfate with calcium-rich samples.
The alkalinity of water measures its capacity to neutralize acids, primarily due to the presence of bicarbonates. Acceptable alkalinity for municipal water supplies is generally between 30 and 500 mg/L as CaCO₃, although some sources exceed these limits. Waters with alkalinity greater than 500 mg/L as CaCO₃ may have objectionable tastes.
Chloride (Cl) anions are commonly found in natural waters. High Cl concentrations occur in waters that contact Cl-containing geological formations. Otherwise, elevated Cl levels may indicate pollution from sewage, industrial wastes, or seawater intrusion into freshwater bodies or aquifers. A salty taste in water depends on the ions associated with Cl; it is detectable with Na ions at about 250 mg/L, but with Ca or Mg, it may be undetectable up to 1,000 mg/L. Although chlorides are highly soluble and present in all waters, their concentrations are often very low in natural waters. High Cl content can be corrosive to metal pipes and harmful to most trees and plants.
The determination of Cl is performed using the AgNO₃ (Mohr’s titration) method, based on the reaction of silver with Cl and chromate (Cr). Silver reacts with Cl to precipitate before reacting with chromate. The appearance of a brick-red color from silver chromate precipitate indicates the end-point of the titration.
Dissolve 5 g of K₂CrO₄ in 50 mL of deionized (DI) water.
Add 1 N silver nitrate (AgNO₃) dropwise until a slight permanent red precipitate forms.
Filter and dilute to 100 mL with DI water.
Dry about 3 g of AgNO₃ in an oven at 105 °C for 2 hours, cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered brown bottle.
Dissolve 1.696 g of dried AgNO₃ in DI water and bring to a 1 L volume.
Dry about 3 g of NaCl in an oven at 140 °C for 2 hours, cool in a desiccator, and store in a tightly stoppered brown bottle.
Dissolve 0.585 g of NaCl in DI water and bring to a 1 L volume.
Pipette a suitable aliquot of the water sample (10 mL for natural water) into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask.
Add 4 drops of potassium chromate solution.
Titrate against the AgNO₃ solution until a permanent reddish-brown color appears.
Titrate 10 mL of 0.01 N NaCl solution against 0.01 N AgNO₃ after adding 4 drops of potassium chromate until a permanent reddish-brown color appears.
Natural waters typically have low Cl levels, making 10 mL a suitable aliquot.
Saline waters may have high Cl levels; therefore, 5 mL (or even less) may be more appropriate.
Regular testing on a water supply can indicate sudden pollution from sewerage or other chloride-rich wastes.
Regular testing on a water supply can indicate sudden pollution from sewerage or other chloride-rich wastes.
Sulfate (SO₄) is an abundant ion in the Earth's crust, with concentrations in water ranging from a few milligrams to several thousand milligrams per liter (mg/L). Industrial wastes and mine drainage can contain high concentrations of SO₄, which also results from the breakdown of sulfate-containing organic compounds. Although sulfate is not considered a notably toxic anion, it can lead to the formation of hard scale in steam boilers when present in water containing calcium. In large amounts, sulfate can impart a bitter taste to water, and concentrations above 250 mg/L may have a laxative effect, while 500 mg/L is generally considered safe. The concentration of sulfate in water is typically determined using barium sulfate (BaSO₄) precipitation.
Dissolve 0.1 g of methyl orange indicator in 100 mL of deionized (DI) water.
Mix equal portions of concentrated HCl with DI water.
Dissolve 122 g of BaCl₂·2H₂O in DI water and dilute to a final volume of 1 L.
Pipette a suitable aliquot of the water sample into a 250-mL Erlenmeyer flask or a wide-mouthed Pyrex beaker (50 mL of natural water sample).
Add 1 mL of the 1:1 HCl solution and 2-3 drops of methyl orange; if the color does not turn pink, add more 1:1 HCl.
Place the Pyrex beakers on a hotplate, heat to boiling, and then add 10 mL of the 1 N BaCl₂·2H₂O solution in excess to precipitate sulfate as barium sulfate (BaSO₄).
Boil for 5 to 10 minutes, cover with a watch glass, and allow to cool.
Filter the solution through ashless filter paper, collecting the BaSO₄ precipitate on the filter paper. Wash several times with warm DI water until no trace of chloride remains; this can be checked using AgNO₃ solution.
After washing, place the filter paper with the precipitate into a pre-weighed and dried porcelain crucible (Wt₁), and dry in an oven at 105 °C for 1 hour.
Transfer the crucible to a muffle furnace heated to 550 °C, and leave to ash for 2-3 hours.
Remove the crucible from the muffle furnace, place it in a desiccator to cool, weigh it on an analytical balance, and record the weight (Wt₂).
Note: 0.1165 g of BaSO₄ is equivalent to 1 milli-equivalent of SO₄.
In most natural waters, boron (B) is rarely found in concentrations greater than 1 mg/L. However, even this low concentration can adversely affect certain agricultural products. Water with B concentrations exceeding 2 mg/L can negatively impact many common crops, and levels greater than 5 mg/L may lead to toxicity. Groundwater may have higher B concentrations, particularly in areas where water interacts with igneous rocks or other B-containing strata.
The B content in many waters has been increasing due to industrial waste and the use of boric acid (H₃BO₃) and its salts in cleaning compounds. Ingestion of B at concentrations typically found in natural waters has no adverse effects on humans. However, large quantities can affect the central nervous system, and prolonged consumption of water containing B can result in a condition known as borism.
The hot-water procedure remains the most popular method for measuring B, introduced by Berger and Truog (1939) and modified by subsequent researchers. Boron is measured calorimetrically using Azomethine-H (Bingham, 1982).
To prepare the solution, dissolve 250 g of ammonium acetate (NH₄OAc) and 15 g of disodium EDTA (ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid, disodium salt) in 400 mL of DI water. Slowly add 125 mL of glacial acetic acid (CH₃COOH) and mix well.
Dissolve 0.114 g of boric acid (H₃BO₃) in deionized (DI) water and bring the volume to 1 L. This solution contains 20 ppm of boron (B) and is referred to as the Stock Solution.
Dilute 2.5, 5.0, 7.5, 10.0, 12.5, and 15.0 mL of the Stock Solution to 100-mL in numbered flasks by adding DI water, and then bring to volume. These solutions will contain 0.5, 1.0, 1.5, 2.0, 2.5, and 3.0 ppm of B, respectively.
Pipette a 2-mL aliquot of the natural water sample into a 10-mL polypropylene tube.
Add 4 mL of Azomethine-H solution and mix well.
Pipette 2 mL of each standard solution (0.5 – 3.0 ppm) and proceed as you would for the samples.
Also make a blank with 2 mL of DI water and process it in the same way as the samples.
Read the absorbance of the blank, standards, and samples after 30 minutes on a spectrophotometer at a wavelength of 420 nm.
Prepare a calibration curve for the standards by plotting absorbance against the respective B concentrations.
Read the B concentration in the unknown samples from the calibration curve.
Use glassware minimally; always use concentrated HCl-treated glassware (soaked for a week) where absolutely essential.
This box discusses the effects of soil pH on the availability of various nutrients to plants. It highlights essential nutrients like molybdenum, copper, zinc, boron, manganese, iron, magnesium, calcium, sulfur, potassium, phosphate, and nitrogen. The text likely details how different pH levels can influence the uptake of these nutrients by plants.
Measure the temperature of the buffer solutions and adjust the “temperature” knob accordingly.
Dip the combined electrode in the pH 7.0 buffer solution, check the actual pH at the measured temperature, and adjust with the “buffer” knob. Then, dip the electrode in the pH 4.0 buffer solution and adjust with the “sensitivity” knob.
Repeat until the pH meter provides correct readings for both buffer solutions.
Wash the combined electrode thoroughly with DI water and carefully dry any excess water with a tissue.
Rinse the pH electrode with DI water, then wipe it with a cloth or lens tissue.
Between measurements, leave the pH electrode in DI water.
Do not remove the electrode from the solution until the meter is on standby; otherwise, electrode polarization may occur.
Never allow sample solutions to dry on the electrode.
Do not rub the electrode against the sides of the beaker.
Keep the pH buffer solution properly closed and never pour unused buffer back into the bottle.
Always switch the instrument to standby or off before removing the electrode.
Keep the glass electrode in DI water or saturated KCl solution (preferred) when not in use.
For short-term storage, keep the electrode in an electrode storage solution or a pH buffer solution between 4.0 and 7.0.
For long-term storage, clean the pH electrode with DI water and wipe it dry with soft paper or lens tissue.
Measure the temperature of 0.01 N KCl.
Dip the platinum electrode in 0.01 N KCl, which should give a reading of 1.413 dS/m at 25 °C.
Repeat until the EC meter gives the correct reading.
Soak the platinum electrode in 32 mL of saturated sodium dichromate (Na₂Cr₂O₇) and then in 6 M H₂SO₄.
Rinse the platinum electrode three times with deionized (DI) water.
Between measurements, store the platinum electrode in DI water.
For short-term storage, immerse the platinum electrode in DI water.
For long-term storage, clean the electrode with DI water and wipe it dry with soft paper or lens tissue.
Here, ECe is measured in dS/m, and the conversion factor for ECe to total dissolved salts (mg/L) varies from 550 to 900, depending on the specific anions present and their concentrations.
The Kjeldahl method consists of three main steps: digestion, distillation, and titration.
This reaction produces ammonia gas when heated.
Here, ammonia gas reacts with boric acid to form an ammonium-borate complex, affecting the pH of the solution.
The concentration and composition of dissolved salts in water are crucial for determining its quality for irrigation. Concerns about irrigation water quality often relate to high salt concentrations, sodium hazards, carbonate and bicarbonate hazards, or toxic ions (e.g., boron or chloride). Required analyses for assessing water quality include EC and the levels of soluble anions and cations. These analyses are routine for any soil-plant analysis laboratory, and all laboratories in the WANA region are equipped to evaluate water quality.
Na, Ca, and Mg represent the concentrations of the respective ions in meq/L in water (or solution). The anion and cation concentrations in water/solution are also measured in meq/L.
Boron concentration in irrigation water is considered safe only up to 0.7 ppm, while sodium and chloride concentrations below 70 and 140 ppm, respectively, are deemed safe.
Moist-Cast Test: Compress moist soil in your hand. If it holds together, test its strength by transferring it from hand to hand; a more durable cast indicates higher clay content.
Ribbon Test: Roll moist soil into a cylinder and squeeze it between your thumb and forefinger to form the longest ribbon possible. Clay creates the longest ribbons.
Graininess Test: Rub soil between your thumb and forefinger. Sand feels grainy, while silt has a slippery texture.
Stickiness Test: Moisten soil and compress it between your thumb and forefinger. The degree of stickiness is gauged by how well it adheres upon release and how much it stretches.
Shine Test: Roll a small ball of moderately dry soil and rub it against a smooth surface. A shine on the ball indicates clay presence.
Flakes instead of ribbons suggest a sandy texture.
A slippery, slightly grainy, and slightly sticky consistency indicates loamy soil.
Thick, short ribbons (< 1 cm) suggest high clay content.
Thin, long ribbons (5-7 cm) that hold their weight indicate very clayey soil.
Class 1: Low Salinity: Good water, low likelihood of salt accumulation with normal irrigation.
Class 2: Medium Salinity: Can be used with moderate excess water for leaching; supports moderate salt-tolerant plants without serious yield loss.
Class 3: High Salinity: Not suitable for clay soils or those with poor drainage; requires frequent irrigation and medium to high salt-tolerant crops to maintain yields.
Class 4: Very High Salinity: Not suitable for ordinary irrigation; may be used occasionally on sandy soils with excellent drainage and high salt-tolerant crops.
Class 1: Low Sodium: Safe for most soils in Wyoming.
Class 2: Medium Sodium: Suitable for sandy and loamy soils; potential alkali issues on heavy clay soils without gypsum or equivalent amendments.
However, it is not feasible to use water that is high in salinity (Class 3 or 4) for irrigation. This water will cause surface soil particles to puddle, thus limiting water penetration.
Class 4 - Very High Sodium: Generally unsatisfactory for irrigation. Under special conditions—such as using low salinity water, ensuring favorable gypsum content in soils, high leaching, and implementing special management practices—this water may be permissible. A complete soil analysis is recommended before any use of this water.

This section provides factors to convert between SI and non-SI units. The first column lists the non-SI units and the second column indicates the corresponding SI units along with their conversion factors.
Number of grams of solute × 100 per volume of solvent (mL).
Volume of solute × 100 per volume of solution.
Weight of solute × 100 weight of solution.
Milligrams of solute or milligrams per liter of solution.
Micrograms of solute or micrograms per liter of solution.
Soil is deficient in Ca and/or Mg and should be limed.
Poor crop growth due to low cation exchange capacity and possible Al³⁺ toxicity; expect P deficiency.
Soil is lime-free and should be closely monitored.
Satisfactory for most crops; ideal range for crop production.
Soil cation exchange capacity is near 100% base saturation.
Free lime (CaCO₃) exists in the soil, resulting in excellent filtration and percolation of water due to high Ca content in clays.
Both P and micronutrients are less available, indicating sodic soil with poor physical conditions.
Infiltration and percolation of soil water are slow, leading to possible root deterioration and organic matter dissolution.

This section provides a list of various crop species along with their respective tolerances to boron toxicity, measured in terms of the threshold concentration that can cause a 50% reduction in crop yields.
The relative tolerance of plant species to boron toxicity is expressed in terms of the threshold concentrations that correspond to yield reductions.
Lemon (Citrus limon) has a threshold tolerance of 0.028 ppm.
Pea (Pisum sativum), Lima bean (Phaseolus lunatus), and carrot (Daucus carota) are also noted for their low tolerance levels.
Semi-tolerant crops like tomato (Lycopersicum esculentum) and cotton (Gossypium hirsutum) have threshold levels ranging from 0.56 to 0.93 ppm.
