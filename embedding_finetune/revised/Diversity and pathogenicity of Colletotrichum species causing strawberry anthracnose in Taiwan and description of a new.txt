Diversity and Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum Species Causing Strawberry Anthracnose in Taiwan and Description of a New Species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov.
Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.
Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) is a popular small fruit crop known for its high economic and nutritive value, and it is in high demand globally. From 2008 to 2018, the annual worldwide cultivation of strawberries increased from approximately 400 to 483 thousand hectares. Although strawberries are native to temperate regions, they can also be grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sometimes under high-altitude conditions. The land areas devoted to strawberry cultivation in Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Taiwan in 2018 were 1,482 ha, 1,453 ha, 690 ha, 522 ha, and 506 ha, respectively.
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.
Colletotrichum spp. have traditionally been classified based on the shape of the conidia and appressorium, the presence of a seta or perithecium, and culture characteristics. Using these criteria, early studies reported C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae as strawberry anthracnose pathogens. However, Colletotrichum spp. share similar features, and morphological characteristics can be influenced by environmental factors including culture media, light, and temperature. Therefore, a polyphasic approach based on morphology and genetic characteristics has been proposed for the identification of Colletotrichum species. A combination of multiple gene sequences, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), can provide more molecular features to resolve different species within the Colletotrichum species complex.
Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.
To provide accurate information for disease control and resistance breeding, this study aimed to reveal the population composition of the infectious agents associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. Samples collected from major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan from 2010 to 2018 were subjected to morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at various temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium, as well as their ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the UK and China (including Anhui, Hainan, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces, as well as Beijing and Shanghai), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose disease in subtropical regions.
Molecular Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis: Colletotrichum spp. isolates were first identified at the species complex level. Among the 52 Colletotrichum spp. isolates sampled from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan, 45 (86.5%) isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 4 (7.7%) belonged to the C. boninense species complex, and 3 (5.8%) belonged to the C. acutatum species complex.
To analyze the phylogeny of the C. boninense species complex, six gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, and CAL) from four isolates, along with 31 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878), were used to construct phylogenetic trees. The final data matrix contained a total of 2,363 characters, including gaps, distributed as follows: ITS (1-558), GAPDH (559-852), CHS-1 (853-1,132), ACT (1,133-1,411), TUB2 (1,412-1,914), and CAL (1,915-2,363). Among these, 365 characters were parsimony informative, 407 were parsimony uninformative, and 1,591 were constant. After 1,187,000 generations of topological convergence via Bayesian inference (BI) analysis, 492 trees were obtained. The first 25% of the trees were discarded, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, and the remaining trees were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. The maximum likelihood (ML) analysis yielded a best-scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of -10,025.941645. The most parsimonious tree from the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis had a tree length of 1,281, with a consistency index (CI) of 0.774 and a retention index (RI) of 0.839. In the single gene trees of GAPDH, CHS-1, and TUB2, along with the multilocus phylogenetic tree, three isolates (ML351, 442, 1792) clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CGMCC 3.14194 and other related isolates of C. karstii.
Table Description: Table 1 lists the various Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. It includes multiple isolates, with some entries in bold indicating representative isolates selected for mycelial growth and pathogenicity assays. The table categorizes the isolates into species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. miaoliense (sp. nov), C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides, alongside their geographic locations, such as Shitan Township and Dahu Township in Miaoli County, and Renai Township in Nantou County. Each entry also includes GenBank accession numbers, and additional notes clarify the availability of some data, specifically regarding genetic markers like ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, and CAL.
To identify species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, a combination of seven gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT) was analyzed from 45 isolates, along with 47 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. boninense (CBS 123755). This analysis led to the construction of phylogenetic trees, as detailed in Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1. The final data matrix comprised a total of 3,571 characters, which included gaps (ITS: 1–553, GAPDH: 554–808, CHS-1: 809–1,051, ACT: 1,052–1,325, TUB2: 1,326–2,028, CAL: 2,029–2,728, ApMAT: 2,729–3,571). Among these, 655 characters were parsimony informative, 735 were parsimony uninformative, and 2,181 were constant.
After 6,574,000 generations of topological convergence via Bayesian Inference (BI) analysis, 9,864 trees were generated. The first 25% of these trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, while the remaining trees were utilized to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree (Fig. 3). The Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis resulted in a best-scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of −18,514.217014. The most parsimonious tree derived from Maximum Parsimony (MP) analysis had a tree length of 2,400, with a Consistency Index (CI) of 0.722 and a Retention Index (RI) of 0.876.
In the single-gene trees for TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT, as well as in the multilocus phylogenetic tree, 39 isolates clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 130417 and other related isolates of C. siamense (Fig. 3; single-gene trees not shown). These 39 isolates formed a subclade with a high support value (1/100/98 for BI/ML/MP) (Fig. 3). Additionally, in single-gene trees for GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT, as well as in the multilocus phylogenetic tree, six isolates clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 130416 and other related isolates of C. fructicola (Fig. 3; single-gene trees not shown).
Based on morphological traits and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, the 52 isolates were assigned to five Colletotrichum species, which included one new taxon (C. miaoliense sp. nov.) (Fig. 4; described in detail below), one newly recorded taxon in strawberry (C. karstii), and three species known to be associated with strawberry anthracnose.
The colony features observed at 25 °C on PDA and 1/4 PDA were predominantly white to grey, with orange conidia ooze. C. siamense ML133 and C. karstii ML351 produced abundant conidia when cultured on 1/4 PDA at 25 °C; C. boninense ML521 yielded more conidia on PDA at 25 °C; and C. fructicola ML348 and C. miaoliense ML1040 sporulated more abundantly on 1/4 PDA at 30 °C. The conidium and appressorium measurements of the five Colletotrichum species (isolates from this study and the type strains) are listed in Supplementary Table S2. Notably, the conidia produced by C. miaoliense ML1040 were longer, with a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 3.4, compared to the conidia of the other four species in this study, which had an L/W ratio of 2.3–3.0 (Figs. S2–S5; Supplementary Table S2).

Miaoli and Nantou Counties, Taiwan.
Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 × 2.3 – 4.9 × 0.7 μm versus 14.2 × 1.1 – 4.1 × 0.34 μm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 × 2.5 – 5.5 × 1.0 μm versus 7.5 × 1.0 μm).

The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences of the ITS, ApMAT, and GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1, TUB2, CAL genes. Bayesian inference (BI) posterior values above 0.9 and bootstrap support values from maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) above 70% are shown at each node (BI/ML/MP).

Images include (a) upper side of the colony, (b) reverse side of the colony, (c, d) conidiomata, (e-p) appressoria (induced in dH2O on a microscope slide), (q) conidia from conidiomata, (r) conidia from aerial mycelium, (s-w) conidiophores. (a, b) were cultured on PDA; (c, d), and (q-w) were observed on 1/4-strength PDA. Scale bars: (c, d) = 0.2 mm, (e) = 10 μm, which also applies to (f-p, q), and (r-w).
A representative isolate from each of five Colletotrichum species was grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at temperatures ranging from 18°C to 32°C. The maximum growth rate of C. siamense ML133 was estimated at 27.9°C, while the maximum growth rates for C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were observed at 26.0°C, 26.9°C, 24.0°C, and 26.5°C, respectively (see Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S3). The growth rate of C. boninense ML521 drastically decreased at 32°C. C. miaoliense ML1040 exhibited the slowest growth rate across all tested temperatures, except at 32°C. The ranking of species by growth rates at higher temperatures (28°C, 30°C, and 32°C) is as follows: C. siamense ML133 > C. fructicola ML348 > C. karstii ML351 and C. boninense ML521 (at 28°C and 30°C) > C. miaoliense ML1040 > C. boninense ML521 (at 32°C) (refer to Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S3). Additionally, the growth rates of C. siamense ML133 were compared with those of two other representative isolates from C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense (see Supplementary Table S4). The ranking of isolates by mycelial growth rates at both 25°C and 30°C on PDA was as follows: C. siamense ML133 and ML540 > C. siamense ML612 and C. fructicola ML368 > C. fructicola ML356 and C. karstii ML1792 > C. karstii ML442 > C. miaoliense ML1042 and ML1794.
Pathogenicity was tested using Koch's postulates for C. siamense ML133, C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040. All these isolates caused leaf and/or crown necrosis in strawberry seedlings (see Figure S6). C. siamense ML133 caused the most severe symptoms, resulting in a 100% disease incidence. The disease incidences for C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were 30%, 30%, 30%, and 50%, respectively. Notably, after spray inoculation of the seedlings with C. karstii ML351, leaf spots were rarely observed, and no leaf lesions were noted for C. boninense ML521. Despite the minimal visible symptoms, C. boninense ML521 could still be re-isolated from surface-sterilized inoculated leaves.
The virulence of the five selected isolates was further assessed using wounded and non-wounded detached leaves at 25°C and 30°C (see Figure 6). For all five isolates, inoculation of wounded leaves resulted in typical anthracnose lesions, which were first observed 2-4 days post-inoculation (dpi). C. siamense ML133 caused the largest brown necrotic lesions, sometimes with chlorotic or reddish margins (see Figure 6a). The necrotic lesions caused by C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were significantly smaller (Figure 6b; C. fructicola ML348 was slightly more virulent than C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040). At 7 dpi, C. siamense ML133 caused significantly larger lesions at 30°C (1.26 cm in diameter) compared to those at 25°C (0.65 cm in diameter), whereas the sizes of lesions caused by other Colletotrichum species remained similar (0.07-0.35 cm in diameter) at different temperatures (see Figure 6b).
Inoculations of wounded leaves were conducted at 30 °C for C. siamense ML133, C. boninense ML521, and two additional representative isolates of C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense (Fig. S7). The results showed that C. siamense (ML133, ML540, ML612) and C. fructicola ML356 caused significantly larger lesions (1.21–1.74 cm in diameter at 7 days post-inoculation (dpi); 3.06–3.47 cm in diameter at 14 dpi) than C. fructicola ML368, C. karstii (ML442, ML1792), and C. miaoliense (ML1042, ML1794) (0.42–0.76 cm in diameter at 7 dpi; 1.06–2.15 cm in diameter at 14 dpi).
Figure 6 illustrates the inoculation of Colletotrichum species on detached wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves at different temperatures. Panel (a) shows lesions at 7 dpi on wounded leaves or at 14 dpi on non-wounded leaves incubated at 25 °C or 30 °C. The left side of each leaflet was inoculated with a 10 µl spore suspension (10^6 spores/ml) and the right side with water as a control. Panels (b) and (c) present the sizes of lesions resulting from the inoculation of wounded and non-wounded leaves, with results from the same temperature analyzed together. Data (mean ± standard error) with different letters indicate significant differences based on Tukey's range test at P < 0.05 (n = 12). For each species, the difference between 25 °C and 30 °C was analyzed by Student’s t-test (with * denoting significance).
Over the past decade, our understanding of fungi and their relationships with plant hosts has grown exponentially due to advances in bioinformatics and molecular phylogenetics. The identification of cryptic taxa is progressing rapidly, and groups of fungi, including important plant pathogens, are primarily classified using molecular data-based phylogenetic inference. For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20 species. Several Colletotrichum species capable of causing strawberry anthracnose in temperate regions have been reported; however, knowledge of the composition of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions remains limited.
Through morphological characterization, phylogenetic analyses involving five to seven loci (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT), and inoculation tests on strawberry seedlings and detached leaves, this study revealed that five Colletotrichum species cause strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. In addition to the known strawberry anthracnose pathogens C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. siamense, one new species, C. miaoliense, and one species not previously known to infect strawberries, C. karstii, were identified. C. karstii was previously isolated from a wide range of plants such as anthurium, apple, citrus, and chili pepper, but not from strawberry. In this study, C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. miaoliense were isolated from different tissues, and all five Colletotrichum species were confirmed to be pathogenic to strawberry leaves and crowns. The lack of tissue specificity aligns with previous observations of C. acutatum in strawberries.
Among the five Colletotrichum species identified in this study, C. siamense exhibited greater mycelial growth rates on PDA, particularly at higher temperatures. The fitness advantage of C. siamense in warm weather may explain its current geographical distribution. In the literature, C. siamense has been most frequently reported in tropical and subtropical regions, while C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. karstii have been documented across a wide range of latitudes. Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting a pathogen's survival. A recent study based on published observations of 612 crop pests and pathogens from 1960 onward revealed significant positive latitudinal shifts of many important pests and pathogens under climate change. More research on the genetic and biological characteristics of different Colletotrichum species from diverse geographical areas is necessary to understand the emergence and spread of anthracnose diseases. With rising global temperatures, it will be particularly important to monitor the expansion of the heat-adapted C. siamense toward higher latitudes.
C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.
Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.
The study's samples were deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology at National Taiwan University (NTUH). Ex-type living cultures were preserved in the Culture Collection of the same department (NTUCC), the Bioresource and Collection Research Center (BCRC), and the Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station. Nomenclature and taxonomic information were recorded in MycoBank (www.mycobank.org).
Colletotrichum species were stored as mycelium discs in distilled water at 4°C for short-term storage and in 10% glycerol with 5% lactose at −80°C for long-term preservation. Before experiments, each isolate was revived by culturing on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 5 to 7 days at 25°C under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark photoperiod.
For each isolate of Colletotrichum species, mycelium was collected from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA medium. The mycelium was then frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder using a sterile mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System Kit (VIOGENE) following the manufacturer's instructions. Seven genetic fragments—ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT—were amplified using primers listed in Supplementary Table S5, employing a Biometra Thermal Cycler (Biometra TRIO). Each PCR reaction consisted of 1 µL of genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 5 µL of 10X reaction buffer (containing Tris HCl at pH 9.0, PCR enhancers, (NH4)2SO4, and 20 mM MgCl2), 2 µL of dNTPs (2.5 mM each), 1 µL of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µL of 10 µM reverse primer, 0.5 µL (2.5 U) of Prime Taq DNA Polymerase (GenetBio Inc.), and 39.5 µL of distilled water.
The thermal cycling parameters included one cycle at 95°C for 4 minutes, followed by 30–35 cycles at 95°C for 30 seconds, 52–62°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 60 seconds, ending with a final extension step at 72°C for 7 minutes. The optimal annealing temperatures for the different genetic regions were: ITS: 58°C, GAPDH: 52°C, CHS-1: 58°C, ACT: 58°C, TUB2: 58°C, CAL: 59°C, and ApMAT: 62°C. Amplicons were bidirectionally sequenced using the dideoxy termination method on the ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Tri-I Biotech, Taiwan). Raw sequence chromatograms were manually examined, and the sequences of each fragment were assembled in ApE v2.0.55 (A Plasmid Editor, developed by M. Wayne Davis at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT).
Newly generated sequences from each isolate were blasted against the GenBank non-redundant database, restricting searches to type materials for the initial determination of the closest matching species and species complex. Related gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT) from recent publications were downloaded from GenBank. For each gene, sequences from isolates belonging to the same species complex were aligned using the MAFFT v7 online server (https://ma.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/). The aligned sequences were manually edited using MEGA v10 to enhance the alignment. The post-alignment sequences of multiple genes/loci were concatenated in a text editor.
We applied the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) method for species delimitation of Colletotrichum taxa. A novel species was considered distinct if the clade was strongly supported as monophyletic by Bayesian Inference (BI) with a posterior probability of ≥ 0.95, Maximum Likelihood (ML) with a bootstrap value of ≥ 70%, and Maximum Parsimony (MP) with a bootstrap value of ≥ 70% in both the multilocus phylogenetic tree and the majority of individual gene trees.
Morphological Characterization: Morphological characterization of one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species was conducted following the procedures of Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012). Cultures were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and 1/4-strength PDA for 2 to 3 weeks at 25°C and 30°C under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Our preliminary tests indicated that compared to PDA, the low-nutrient medium (1/4 PDA) could stimulate sporulation without affecting the size and shape of conidia. The experiment was performed in two independent trials, each consisting of two to three plates per isolate. Conidiomata were investigated using a dissecting microscope (Leica M125), while conidia, conidiophores, setae, asci, ascomata, and appressoria were examined using a light microscope (Leica DM2500). To induce appressorium formation, 20-30 µl of conidial suspension (prepared with sterile dH2O) was placed on a microscope slide, covered with a cover slip, and incubated in a moist chamber at 25°C for 2 to 3 days. The lengths and widths of 55 conidiogenous cells, 100 conidia, and 30 appressoria were measured using ImageJ software.
Effect of Temperature on Mycelial Growth: Mycelium-agar discs (6 mm in diameter) were cut with a sterilized cork borer from the advancing edge of 5- to 7-day-old Colletotrichum spp. colonies and placed (mycelium-side down) onto the center of a 90 mm Petri dish containing 25 ml of PDA. Colony diameters were measured after 7 days of incubation at various temperatures under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod in a growth chamber (Firstek, GC-560H). The mycelial growth rate (mm/day) was calculated as (diameter of the colony - diameter of the mycelium-agar disc) / 7. For one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species, mycelial growth rates were determined at 18°C, 22°C, 25°C, 28°C, 30°C, and 32°C in two to three independent trials, each consisting of three PDA plates per isolate per temperature. The optimum temperature for mycelial growth was estimated using a Gaussian process (4-parameter) for nonlinear regression in SigmaPlot 14 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Additionally, the growth of two representative isolates from each Colletotrichum species, selected from distinct subclades based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis, was measured at 25°C and 30°C in two independent trials, each consisting of four PDA plates per isolate per temperature.
Pathogenicity Assay: The susceptible cultivar "Taoyuan No. 1" was used for all inoculation tests in this study. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. (one isolate from each species) was examined following Koch's postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff (10^6 spores/ml) and by applying 1 ml of spore suspension (10^6 spores/ml) to the crown region after removing one to two old leaves. Following inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags to maintain >90% relative humidity for 3 days at 30°C, then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30°C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased tissues using the single hypha tip isolation method and then identified based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequences as described above.
