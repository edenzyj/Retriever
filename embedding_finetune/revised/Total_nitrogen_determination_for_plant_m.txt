in a ratio of 970:19:11 w/w/w) is added, and the mixture is digested at 360 to 380 °C for 1 hour after the mixture clears. Ammonium in the digest is determined by a suitable method. This semimicro Kjeldahl procedure results in a recovery of 95% or better of nitrate, whether from KNO₃ or KNO₃ added to plant material.
In conducting experiments that involve analyzing large numbers of samples for total nitrogen, standard equipment and procedures are costly, require considerable laboratory space, and are labor-intensive. A 160-sample digestion apparatus utilizing test tubes and an AutoAnalyzer method for ammonium determination have been developed for use with samples containing little or no nitrate.
This report describes a semimicro method that determines total nitrogen in plant material containing appreciable amounts of nitrate, utilizing a tube digestion apparatus without excessive foaming.
Milled rice (var. Labelle), soybean seed (var. Davis), wheat grain (var. Milam), and leaf material from three-leaf corn (var. Texas 28A), two-leaf cotton (var. Stoneville 213), one-leaf cucumber (var. Ashley), three-leaf peanut (var. Starr), three-leaf rice, two-leaf sorghum (var. NK233), three-leaf soybean, three-leaf wheat, and potassium nitrate were analyzed. All plant samples were dried in an oven at 65 °C and ground in a Wiley mill to pass a 30-mesh screen. Dried samples were stored in a desiccator until analyzed.

acid mixture was added, and four random tubes were taken at intervals for the addition of the catalyst.
acid pretreatment for 2 hours, followed by the addition of Na₂S₂O₈·5H₂O and gentle heating until foaming ceases. The tubes are allowed to cool, the catalyst is added, and the sample is digested. The addition of Na₂S₂O₈·5H₂O results in excessive foaming and loss of sample if extreme care is not exercised.
acid mixture is necessary to obtain quantitative recovery of nitrate nitrogen from KNO₃. A pretreatment time of 0.5 hours or longer results in at least 95% recovery of nitrate nitrogen. For routine use, we pretreat for at least 1 hour before adding the catalyst.
The table summarizes the percentage recovery of nitrate nitrogen from potassium nitrate (KNO₃) using Method B at various pretreatment times. The percentages indicate how much nitrate nitrogen was recovered after different durations: at 0 hours, the recovery was 84.54% ± 5.29%, while after 4 hours, it peaked at 98.46% ± 0.58%. The data suggest that longer pretreatment times lead to higher recovery rates.
Another table outlines the recovery of nitrate nitrogen from different plant materials after adding KNO₃. The average recovery percentages range from 96.16% ± 1.36% for peanut leaf material to 100.00% ± 3.39% for cucumber leaf material. Recovery from KNO₃ was noted at 99.89% ± 0.63%. This indicates that while different plant materials yield varying recovery rates, the method is effective across a range of samples.
This method requires more time than the standard Kjeldahl method but quantitatively recovers nitrate nitrogen, which the standard Kjeldahl method does not. Other methods that recover nitrate nitrogen are not suitable for tube digestion due to the extreme care required to prevent losses.
