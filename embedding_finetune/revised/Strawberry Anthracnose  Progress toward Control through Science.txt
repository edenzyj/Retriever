Anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern U.S. since the 1930s. The causal fungus, Colletotrichum fragariae, infects all above-ground parts of the plant; however, the disease is most severe when it infects the crown, leading to crown rot, wilting, and plant death. Additionally, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has been a problem since the late 1970s, while the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum, was first reported in the U.S. in 1986. Scientific investigations of anthracnose have focused on its epidemiology, the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species, their infection processes, and pathogenicity. Findings from these studies have significantly improved control measures for this disease.
Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.
Colletotrichum fragariae isolates develop colonies that range in color from beige to olive to dark gray. They produce cylindrical conidia that are sharply tapered at one end and rounded at the other, but they do not form the ascigerous state.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates are very similar to C. fragariae; however, they may form the Glomerella cingulata ascigerous state in culture, and their cylindrical conidia are usually rounded at both ends. Both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides isolates produce dark black setae in acervuli in culture, as well as on lesions found on petioles, stolons, and fruits. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture is slower than that of the other two species, especially at higher temperatures. Identifying Colletotrichum species based solely on morphological and cultural characteristics is challenging due to the overlapping ranges of various traits. A number of molecular methods have been employed to differentiate these species, including arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA), nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA, and species-specific primers based on the ITS regions (Freeman et al., 2000a; Lewis Ivey et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2007).
The greatest economic loss from anthracnose in strawberries is due to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum. This pathogen also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including blueberries, blackberries, grapes, tomatoes, peaches, and peppers (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often lead to stunted growth rather than plant death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplanting and produce few berries at harvest.
Colletotrichum fragariae was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931) and spread throughout the Southeast, where it caused crown rot and death in many strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This species has a narrow host range and is rarely found outside the Southeastern U.S. It generally causes more severe symptoms on petioles and crowns compared to C. acutatum and is considered by some to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was identified in the late 1970s as the causal agent of crown rot identical to that caused by C. fragariae (Howard et al., 1992), leading to significant damage in the strawberry industry across several states. This species has a broad host and geographic range, causing diseases in many plants worldwide. It can result in major plant death in the fall when plants are transplanted into production fields.
Colletotrichum acutatum is the most common anthracnose fruit-rot pathogen, while C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides are more frequently associated with lesions on petioles and stolons and with crown rot. However, all three species can cause similar symptoms and are sometimes found on the same plant (Howard et al., 1992). Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not related (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2003; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2003) characterized a group of Colletotrichum isolates using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests.
and exhibited variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequences. Based on these molecular analyses, they proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberry.
The first indication of anthracnose crown rot infection, caused by either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides, is often the wilting of the youngest leaves (Smith, 1998a). The wilted leaves may appear to recover and become turgid in the evenings; however, most will wilt and die after a few days. A red discoloration then appears within the crown tissue, and the causal pathogen may be isolated from this discolored tissue. C. acutatum may also cause crown death; however, typically only one side of the crown is infected rather than the entire crown, and infected plants are stunted but do not die. Any of the three Colletotrichum species may cause petiole and stolon lesions, which are dark brown or black, sunken, and often girdle the petiole or stolon. Pink masses of conidia are usually visible near the center of the lesions. All three species also cause leaf spots (Howard et al., 1992; Maas and Palm, 1997; Smith, 1998c).
Black leaf spot, typically caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides, is characterized by gray or light black spots scattered across the top surface of strawberry leaflets. These spots usually are not necrotic. In contrast, C. acutatum more typically causes irregular leaf spots, with necrotic black lesions at the tips of the leaflets. It also causes root lesions. All three Colletotrichum species can incite flower blights and fruit rots (Smith, 1998b). Fully open flowers are much more susceptible than closed buds (Smith, 2007). Infected green fruit are often hard, brown, and mummified rather than ripened. Anthracnose lesions on ripe fruit are firm, slightly sunken, and covered with pink spore masses.
The time from infection of the strawberry by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is a critical factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. This period depends on the temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25 °C to 6 to 17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may serve as a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may contribute to inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003).
Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. C. acutatum can survive up to 8 weeks on leaves (Leandro et al., 2003), up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997), and up to 12 months in soil and plant debris under dry conditions. However, conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically when soil moisture is ≥12% (Feil et al., 2003; Urena-Padilla et al., 2001).
Rain splash is the primary means by which conidia of Colletotrichum spp. spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduces the amount of rain penetrating the plant canopy, thereby decreasing splash. Most fruit infections occur within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997).
Using light and electron microscopy, Curry et al. (2002) studied the infection process of strawberry petioles and stolons by C. acutatum and...
Since the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields is infected transplants, planting disease-free plants is the best control method. However, obtaining anthracnose-free plants has become more challenging as the geographic range of the causal pathogens has expanded to most areas where strawberry plants are produced. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern U.S., where the pathogens are endemic, by locating plant production nurseries away from commercial fruit production fields.
Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).
Anthracnose spreads within a field through splashing water. Living mulches, such as wheat, rye, or rye grass, in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread. Organic mulches like wheat straw or pine needles also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Coelho et al., 2008; Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Coelho et al., 2008; Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986).
Anthracnose crown rot is less severe in commercial fields when strawberries are grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels, especially from ammonium sources, were more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate (Smith, 2009a, 2009b). Field studies by Nam et al. (2006) showed that higher levels of nitrogen and potassium increased anthracnose crown rot disease severity compared to phosphorus and calcium. Anthracnose fruit rot was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl2 developed less fruit rot than those from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl2 (Smith and Gupton, 1993).
The USDA-ARS program resulted in over 1,500 anthracnose-resistant selections from seedlings field-tested in Mississippi. Four of these selections were released as breeding lines (Galletta et al., 1993), and one was released as the cultivar Pelican, which is highly resistant to anthracnose crown rot caused by Colletotrichum fragariae and to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum (Smith et al., 1998). Pelican is also resistant to five races of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae. Other selections have been utilized as parent lines in various breeding programs. To enhance genetic diversity in strawberry germplasm used in breeding, anthracnose-resistant clones have been identified in native plant collections and are being incorporated as parent lines (Lewers et al., 2007).
The resistance of strawberry plants to C. fragariae is influenced by environmental conditions following inoculation. Plants incubated at a high temperature (35 °C) for 48 hours at nearly 100% relative humidity exhibited more severe disease symptoms than those incubated at 25 or 30 °C (Smith and Black, 1987). Further incubation at 32 °C resulted in more severe symptoms compared to incubation at 25 °C. Tissue culture-induced (somaclonal) variation is another strategy pursued for generating disease-resistant genotypes (Hammerschlag et al., 2006).
Planting resistant cultivars such as Sweet Charlie, Florida Radiance, and Florida Elyana has reduced losses from anthracnose fruit rot in Florida, likely because C. acutatum lacks the genetic diversity to overcome this resistance (Mertely et al., 2009). However, when moderately susceptible (e.g., Strawberry Festival) or highly susceptible cultivars (e.g., Camarosa and Treasure) are grown, regular fungicide applications are often necessary to manage the disease (Chang and Smith, 2007). Unless highly resistant cultivars are planted, growers must rely on a combination of chemical applications and cultural practices to mitigate anthracnose losses.
Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action. Natural products have also been evaluated as alternative fungicides, offering different modes of action, lower toxicity, and increased efficacy (Abril et al., 2008).
The efficacy of fungicides for anthracnose control is routinely assessed in field studies. For example, 16 different fungicide treatments were evaluated in five studies conducted in Hammond, LA, and Poplarville, MS, during the 2002, 2003, and 2005 fruiting seasons (Wedge et al., 2007).
Anthracnose fruit rot was observed on berries treated with pyraclostrobin + boscalid, cyprodinil + fludioxonil, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and captan + fenhexamid, as well as captan alone. Studies conducted in North Carolina indicated that a fungicide spray program consisting of only four applications—one application of a mixture of captan and Topsin M (thiophanate-methyl, Cerexagri-Nisso, King of Prussia, PA), two applications of Pristine, and one application of CaptEvate (fenhexamid and captan, Arysta, Cary, NC)—provided a similar level of disease control as a season-long spray program with eight applications (Rahman et al., 2009). Each application in the shorter program included two fungicides, as both Pristine and CaptEvate contain two active ingredients.
Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.
The effectiveness of fungicides can be enhanced and their costs reduced when applications are guided by environmental models rather than a strict calendar schedule. Equations predicting the severity of both anthracnose and Botrytis fruit rots have been developed in Florida based on temperature and leaf wetness duration (Pavan et al., 2009). This information has been utilized to create a web-based decision support system for growers to optimize the timing of fungicide applications for controlling fruit rot diseases. Field tests of this system demonstrated that the number of fungicide applications could be reduced by half without any significant loss of yield.
As our understanding of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has improved, so has our capacity to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have led to reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly decreased losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. The introduction of partially resistant cultivars has also helped mitigate economic losses due to these diseases. Nonetheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental conditions are highly conducive to anthracnose development.
Increased losses from anthracnose fruit and crown rots may be associated with the transition from matted row culture to the annual plasticulture production system in the U.S. Breeding for resistance to anthracnose and the development of resistant cultivars are primary strategies for reducing economic losses from this disease, which would also decrease the reliance on fungicides.
