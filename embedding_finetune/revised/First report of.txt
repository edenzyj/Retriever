In northeast Argentina, a serious leaf spot disease affecting sweet orange (Citrus sinensis (L.) Osbeck) and other Citrus species resembles greasy spot caused by Mycosphaerella citri Whiteside. It was previously assumed to be greasy spot. Both diseases exhibit hypertrophy and eventual gummosis in the spongy mesophyll, with sufficient pressure on the lower leaf surface to raise the epidermis without breaking it. The first indication of a difference in etiology is the presence of fallen, decomposing citrus leaves. Additionally, the Argentine material did not show persistent appressoria in the outer stomatal chambers or filamentous hyphae in the diseased spongy mesophyll, which are characteristic of M. citri. Another distinction from greasy spot is the presence of numerous, unidentified spherical structures, ranging from 2 to 12 micrometers in diameter, found in and near the necrotic mesophyll tissue, primarily within the lower epidermis. Although the disease in Argentina is not caused by M. citri, a fungal cause is still considered probable, as foliar applications of copper fungicides provide effective control.

During March and April of 1984, 1985, and 1986, irregularly shaped tan lesions with associated chlorosis were observed near the tips of the lower leaves of several lines of winter barley (Hordeum vulgare L.) at early tillering in breeding nurseries near Ithaca, New York. The fungus Ascochyta hordei Hara var. americana Punith. was consistently isolated from the lesions; identification was based on yellow-brown submerged pycnidia measuring 157 ± 33 micrometers in diameter, with characteristically darkened cells around the ostiole. Conidia were medianly uniseptate, hyaline to pale yellow, measuring 25.2 ± 1.8 micrometers in length and 5.5 ± 0.4 micrometers in width. Pathogenicity was confirmed on seedlings of Birka barley, marking the first successful reisolation of this fungus on any cereal in the northeastern United States. Symptom development did not progress past the lower leaves on any of the observed plants, and the incidence of this disease may be underestimated due to the similarity of foliar symptoms to those caused by frost injury.

The viruses were serologically identical in reciprocal gel diffusion tests and incited similar symptoms in extensive host range studies. This is the first report of TAV in Arkansas. The isolate is considered to be identical to R. tac-Smith H. Tramaie. The publication costs of these articles were defrayed in part by page charge payments. These articles must therefore be marked "advertisement" in accordance with 18 U.S.C. § 1734 solely to indicate this fact.

A bract spot of poinsettia (Euphorbia pulcherrima Willd.) has occurred each winter since 1982 in central Florida nurseries. Black lesions up to 3 cm in diameter appear on bract margins and tips and sometimes on leaves, often resulting in plant loss. Isolations yielded Corynespora cassiicola (Berk. & Curt.) Wei. Five poinsettias were each inoculated with one of four conidial suspensions (1 x 10^4/ml) or water to runoff under intermittent mist for 24 hours before and 14 days after inoculation. Typical lesions occurred on the bracts of plants inoculated with C. cassiicola, and the pathogen was reisolated from symptomatic tissue only. Inoculations of Aeschynanthus (Blume) G. Don with isolates (1), Ficus benjamina (2), Ligustrum sinense Lour., Lycopersicon esculentum L. (Mill.) Karst ex Fariv., and Saintpaulia ionantha H. Wendl. resulted in typical bract spots for each isolate within 14 days. No indication of host specificity was noted.

Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds was isolated during the spring of 1983 from strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duch. 'Cardinal') growing in Mississippi fields established with nursery plants from Arkansas. Fruit and petiole lesions were common, and crown lesions occurred on scattered wilted plants. C. acutatum was isolated consistently from each of these lesion types. Additional isolates, identified in our laboratory as C. acutatum, came from Florida (C. Howard) and Missouri (W. Goff) strawberry fields established with Arkansas-grown plants, as well as from California (S. Wilhelm) fields established with California-grown plants. Spray inoculations of cv. Tioga plants with conidial suspensions (1.5 x 10^6 conidia/ml) of the Mississippi C. acutatum isolates resulted in fruit, petiole, and crown lesions, with wilting of crown-infected plants. Reisolations from each lesion type yielded isolates with characteristics of the one used to inoculate the host. C. acutatum had been reported on strawberry in Australia and New Zealand but has not been reported on strawberry in the United States or previously shown to cause a crown rot and wilt disease.

Pseudomonas corrugata Roberts & Scarlett was first identified as the causal agent of tomato pith necrosis in England in 1978 (2). The disease was initially recognized in the United States in 1981 and 1982 in California and Florida (1), respectively. It was first observed in Louisiana in field-grown tomatoes (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. 'Florader') during the spring of 1983 and has since been seen each year in several areas of the state. Diseased plants exhibit symptoms that include elongated lesions, stem splitting, and other characteristic signs scattered throughout tomato fields. P. corrugata, a nonfluorescent pseudomonad, was consistently isolated from diseased tissues and produced pith necrosis when injected (0.5 ml, 10^7 cfu/ml) into 4-week-old greenhouse-grown 'Bonny Best' tomato plants. The cultural, biochemical, and physiological characteristics of two Louisiana isolates were similar in comparative studies to those of known P. corrugata from Florida (1).
