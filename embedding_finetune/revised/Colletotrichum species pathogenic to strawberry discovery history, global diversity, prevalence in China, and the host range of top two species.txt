Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.

The genus Colletotrichum is considered one of the top ten important genera of fungal pathogens globally (Dean et al., 2012). Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020). Currently, a total of 257 Colletotrichum species grouped into 15 complexes and 13 additional singletons have been accepted in this genus.
Ji et al. (2022) reported that the Colletotrichum genus includes C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (s.l., complex, aggregate) and C. acutatum s.l. as the top two complexes, comprising 57 and 41 species, respectively (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). The Rosaceae family has the highest number of records associated with the Colletotrichum genus, hosting as many as 41 species (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). Common symptoms caused by Colletotrichum fungi include postharvest fruit rot, Glomerella leaf spot, and premature defoliation, affecting apple (Zhang et al., 2021; Chen et al., 2022), pear (Fu et al., 2019), peach (Tan et al., 2022), strawberry (Eaton et al., 2021; Wang et al., 2022), and various other rosaceous plants (Dowling et al., 2020). Among these crops, strawberry is particularly vulnerable to fungal diseases due to its short stature and soft berries lacking protective skin. One Colletotrichum species can infect all parts of the strawberry plant (Adhikari et al., 2019). Anthracnose has become a limiting factor for the ecological and sustainable development of strawberry production, posing a serious and ongoing threat to strawberry security (Zhang et al., 2012). Specifically, anthracnose crown rot has a significantly destructive impact on strawberries compared to other diseases.
The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Martínez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).
Despite intensive research that has contributed to the understanding of the Colletotrichum genus pathogenic to strawberries, there is still a lack of an accurate inventory of these causal agents. The population and prevalence of strawberry-virulent Colletotrichum species have not been systematically investigated in major producers such as China. To address these gaps, this review aims to summarize the biodiversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries by examining the global discovery history. Subsequently, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries in China was analyzed using available data. Finally, we categorized the host range of the two predominant species responsible for strawberry crown rot. This knowledge has important applications for biosecurity risk management (e.g., proper risk estimation in strawberry seedling trade), accurate diagnosis, and anthracnose control. It further lays the groundwork for systematically managing Colletotrichum genera in agricultural ecosystems, not only for the strawberry industry.
From a historical perspective, identifying the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose has faced considerable confusion at the species level for a long time. This process has gradually evolved from coarse estimates to precise identifications, as noted by Ji et al. in Phytopathology Research (2022). The first report of strawberry infection by C. fragariae occurred over 90 years ago in the southeastern USA (Brooks 1931). Morphological observations make it difficult to distinguish C. fragariae from C. gloeosporioides, the latter of which was described in the nineteenth century for a pathogen isolated from citrus in Italy (Penzig 1882). Consequently, early-stage strawberry anthracnose was often attributed to either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides.
A significant milestone occurred with the separation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides, when the former was identified as the causal agent of strawberry fruit rot in Australia (Simmonds 1965). In the 1980s, it was suggested that C. gloeosporioides was synonymous with C. fragariae in strawberries (Howard 1983; Smith and Black 1987). Although many pathologists attempted to differentiate among C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum (Smith and Black 1990; Gunnell and Gubler 1992), morphological distinctions remained ambiguous.
During the last decade of the twentieth century, strawberry anthracnose became a global issue. A primer, CgInt, targeting the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal gene was believed to be specific to C. gloeosporioides (Mills et al. 1992) and was used for strawberry anthracnose diagnosis until 2015 (Rahman et al. 2015). At the century's end, molecular tools became widely available, revealing significant genetic diversity within C. acutatum (Buddie et al. 1999; Martínez-Culebras et al. 2000, 2003; Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003) and C. gloeosporioides (Suzuki et al. 2010). Subsequently, C. boninense was differentiated from C. gloeosporioides (Moriwaki et al. 2003; Damm et al. 2012b), and C. simmondii was re-evaluated as part of C. acutatum sensu lato (Shivas and Tan 2009). Furthermore, C. theobromicola, previously synonymous with C. fragariae, was identified as part of the C. gloeosporioides complex with a broad host range in tropical and subtropical regions (Rojas et al. 2010; Weir et al. 2012). Additionally, strains formerly identified as C. truncatum were reclassified as C. lineola (Damm et al. 2009), which were confused due to their similarly curved conidia (Sato et al. 2015).
Figure 1 presents a timeline of reports concerning Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry. The years of reports are indicated in brackets, along with original sampling locations when available. Abbreviations for geographic locations of pathogen origins are also provided. The timeline sequentially marks relevant findings from mycologists (unshaded) and strawberry pathologists (shaded) on a central axis, although it is not to scale. Early reports that do not distinguish between species are highlighted in gray boxes.
A total of 23 currently accepted Colletotrichum species are illustrated in distinct colors: orange represents nine species of C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (s.l.), light blue for seven species of C. acutatum s.l., yellow for two species of C. dematium s.l., light green for two species of C. boninense s.l., and dark green for one species of C. truncatum s.l. Additionally, two singletons, C. nigrum and C. coccodes, are included. The abbreviations s.l. and s.s. indicate sensu lato (complex) and sensu stricto (strict sense), respectively.
Ji et al. (2022) referenced the actin-encoding gene (ACT) and the chitin synthase-encoding gene (CHS) as part of their study. Multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, incorporating ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CHS, histone 3 (HIS3), and beta-tubulin (TUB2), effectively distinguished various species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012a). Notably, C. fructicola (from the USA and Canada), C. siamense (from the USA), and C. theobromicola (from the USA) were formally recognized as strawberry pathogens (Weir et al. 2012). Furthermore, alongside C. simmondii (from Australia) (Shivas and Tan 2009), five additional species from the C. acutatum complex, including C. acutatum sensu stricto (s.s.), C. fioriniae (from the USA, UK, and New Zealand), C. godeiae (widely in Europe), C. nymphaeae (from the USA, Israel, and Europe), and C. salicis (from New Zealand), were classified as distinct causal agents of strawberry anthracnose (Damm et al. 2012a). Moreover, C. miaoliense, isolated from crown and leaf tissues, was identified as a strawberry pathogen in Taiwan Province, China, albeit with weak virulence (Chung et al. 2020). To date, seven species from the C. acutatum complex are known to affect strawberries.
Colletotrichum aenigma, part of the C. gloeosporioides complex, was reported as a pathogen in the UK (Baroncelli et al. 2015). C. gloeosporioides s.s. was isolated from diseased strawberry leaves, petioles, and stolons in Hubei Province, China, where C. murrayae was also identified as a causal agent of the disease (Han et al. 2016). In the same year, it was determined that C. murrayae is conspecific with C. siamense (Liu et al. 2016). Two isolates from diseased strawberry rhizomes in northern China were classified as a novel species named C. changpingense of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Jayawardena et al. 2016a). Within the same complex, C. alienum (from Australia) was also identified as a strawberry pathogen (Shivas et al. 2016). Additionally, C. kahawae was first reported from diseased strawberry plants in Chiba, Japan (Gan et al. 2017), and C. viniferum, another species from the C. gloeosporioides complex, was reported to infect strawberry leaves in Shandong Province, China (He et al. 2019). Thus, a total of nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex have been documented as pathogenic to strawberries.
Beyond the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes, C. dematium was recognized for its virulence to strawberries in the USA nearly 50 years ago (Beraha and Wright 1973) and was later reported in India (Singh et al. 2003). Subsequently, C. dematium was accepted as a species complex with curved conidia, and C. lineola from this complex was isolated from diseased strawberries in Canada (Damm et al. 2009). C. dematium s.s. was reported again for its virulence to strawberries in India (Sharma et al. 2013). Additionally, C. boninense s.s. from the C. boninense complex was also noted.
Apart from the species from distinct complexes, there are two singleton species of the genus Colletotrichum that were not clustered with other species of any complex (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021) but are reported to infect strawberries. A typical strain of C. nigrum from Fragaria spp. petioles in the UK was previously identified in a study aimed at circumscribing distinct anthracnose pathogens of several crops (Liu et al., 2013). C. coccodes, which causes strawberry fruit rot, was reported in Australia (Shivas et al., 2016). Indeed, these two singletons were found to be phylogenetically close to each other (Liu et al., 2013).
Additionally, C. paranaense of the C. acutatum complex was once suggested to be associated with Fragaria in Australia (Moreira et al., 2019), but no additional records of virulent C. paranaense strains affecting strawberries are available. When examining the barcodes of that potential C. paranaense strain from strawberry (Moreira et al., 2019) in GenBank, it was identified as a strain of C. simmondsii from Europe (data omitted). Indeed, C. paranaense has been considered endemic to apple, peach, and nectarine in Brazil only (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). Recently, in an effort to identify the causal agent of strawberry crown rot in the USA, C. clidemiae was isolated from strawberry fields alongside C. siamense (86%), C. theobromicola, and C. fructicola. However, C. clidemiae was suggested as the only species not pathogenic to strawberries (Oliveira et al., 2022). Therefore, these two species (C. paranaense and C. clidemiae) are not included in the current list of strawberry pathogens.
In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.
So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide. Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.

Italic letters indicate species complexes.
Only records for pathogens that could be discriminated unambiguously at the species level are included here. Until July 2022, a total of 189 records—dating from the first report for certain species—were used for analysis.
Only the top 10 frequently reported species are ranked (based on at least three independent publications).
The percentage of reported frequency (%) was calculated as the number of reports for certain species divided by the total number of 189 records.
According to Ji et al. (2022), the global diversity of Colletotrichum spp. that are virulent to strawberry was illustrated with identification records supposed to be at the species level. Reports on the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose that could not be confidently identified at the species level were excluded.
Strawberry production is minimal in Africa. In Egypt, both C. gloeosporioides and the C. acutatum complex were reported to infect strawberry, although they were not identified at the species level (Embaby et al. 2010). C. nymphaeae was identified as the unique Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose in Kenya (Martínez-Culebras et al. 2003; Baroncelli et al. 2015) and South Africa (Jayawardena et al. 2016b).
In America, where strawberry is widely cultivated, the diversity of strawberry pathogens is significant. In Canada, three species—C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), C. nymphaeae, and C. lineola (Jayawardena et al. 2016b)—were reported to infect strawberries. In the USA, at least six Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry have been identified, including the dominant C. nymphaeae (Wang et al. 2019), along with C. simmondsii (Faedda et al. 2011), C. siamense (Adhikari et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022), the less prevalent C. fioriniae (Wang et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021), C. fructicola, and C. theobromicola (Weir et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2022). In Mexico, only Colletotrichum spp. at the genus level have been reported (Alvarez 1976; Rojas-Flores et al. 2019). C. nymphaeae infecting strawberry has also been recorded in Colombia and Costa Rica (Baroncelli et al. 2015). In Brazil, C. siamense (Capobiango et al. 2016) and C. karstii (Soares et al. 2021) were identified as pathogens. In Argentina, only the Colletotrichum species complexes (C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides) have been reported as infecting strawberries (Mináco et al. 2000; Ramallo et al. 2000).
Strawberry anthracnose is also prevalent in Asia. In Thailand, although both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes have been associated with strawberries (Photita et al. 2004; Than et al. 2008a, b; Hyde et al. 2018), identification at the species level has been lacking. In India, C. dematium was isolated from diseased strawberries (Sharma et al. 2013). In Bangladesh, C. siamense has been shown to cause strawberry crown rot (Gupta et al. 2019). In Israel and Iran, C. nymphaeae has been identified as infecting strawberry fruits (Jayawardena et al. 2016b; Karimi et al. 2017). In Japan, virulent C. fructicola (predominant) and C. siamense, along with less virulent C. aenigma and C. kahawe, were identified as strawberry pathogens (Gan et al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018). In Korea, only C. fructicola has been confirmed as virulent to strawberry (Nam et al. 2013), although C. acutatum (species complex) from diseased strawberries had been documented previously (Nam et al. 2013).
Ji et al. (2022) reported that a total of 11 Colletotrichum species have been identified as pathogens of strawberries in China, which will be comprehensively introduced later. In Europe, strawberry anthracnose is largely attributed to the C. acutatum complex. Strains of C. godetiae infectious to strawberries have been documented in Ireland and Norway (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Chethana et al. 2016). In Denmark, C. nymphaeae is the only Colletotrichum species reported as a strawberry pathogen (Braganca et al. 2016), with similar reports from Bulgaria (Bobev et al. 2002; Jelev et al. 2008; Jayawardena et al. 2016b), Switzerland, and Portugal (Baroncelli et al. 2015). Both C. godetiae and C. nymphaeae were identified as strawberry pathogens in the Netherlands (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Jayawardena et al. 2016b) and Spain (Damm et al. 2012; Baroncelli et al. 2015).
In the United Kingdom, five species, including C. nigrum (Liu et al. 2013), the more aggressive C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae, as well as the less aggressive C. godetiae and C. aenigma (Baroncelli et al. 2015), have been reported as strawberry pathogens. Notably, C. nigrum and C. aenigma are outside the C. acutatum complex. In Belgium, four species of the C. acutatum complex—C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, and C. salicis—were identified as strawberry pathogens (Grammen et al. 2019). Both C. fioriniae (Baroncelli et al. 2015) and C. nymphaeae (Jayawardena et al. 2016b) were also isolated from diseased strawberries in France. In Italy, pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose include C. simmondsii (Faedda et al. 2011), C. nymphaeae (Damm et al. 2012), C. acutatum sensu stricto (Vitale and Infantino 2014), and C. siamense (Jayawardena et al. 2016b). Additionally, there have been reports of the C. acutatum complex causing strawberry anthracnose rot without species-level identification in four other European countries: Germany (Nirenberg et al. 2002), Czech Republic (Novotný et al. 2007), Finland (Lilja et al. 2011), and Montenegro (Latinovic et al. 2012). Overall, Colletotrichum species infectious to strawberries outside the C. acutatum complex have only been reported in the United Kingdom and Italy.
In Australia, at least five Colletotrichum species, including C. simmondsii (Damm et al. 2012), C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. nymphaeae, C. alienum, and C. coccodes (Shivas et al. 2016), have been associated with strawberry diseases. In New Zealand, distinct species such as C. salicis (Jayawardena et al. 2016b) and C. fioriniae (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Braganca et al. 2016) have also been recorded as strawberry pathogens.
An overview of the global distribution of strawberry-pathogenic Colletotrichum species indicates that the number of common species frequently found worldwide is roughly equal to those reported as potential endemics in a single region.
The prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberries in China has become a significant concern, as China has been the largest strawberry producer in the world since 2010, according to annual statistical data from the Strawberry Division of the Chinese Society for Horticultural Science. In 2021, strawberry growers on the Chinese mainland planted 173,333 hectares and produced five million tons of fruit (Zhang 2021). The diverse cultivation practices and climate conditions in China have favored a high biodiversity of various pathogens affecting strawberries.
The first formal report of strawberry anthracnose in China was made by Hu (1990) at the fifth annual conference of the Chinese Society of Plant Pathology, which took place in Jiangsu Province. In Shanghai, C. fragariae and C. acutatum were identified as strawberry pathogens (Shao 1992; Ye et al. 1997). Subsequently, fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was reported in Shanghai based on morphological identification (Dai et al. 2006). Molecular analysis using ITS sequences facilitated the identification of 16 C. gloeosporioides isolates and one C. acutatum isolate collected from 1996 to 2006 in Shanghai (Ren et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences and restriction enzyme digestion, 31 Colletotrichum isolates collected from diseased strawberries between 2006 and 2007 in Shanghai and Zhejiang were identified as C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae (Xie et al. 2010). Following this, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae were again reported as pathogens affecting strawberries in Zhejiang (Ren et al. 2011). A study collected 114 fungal isolates from the C. gloeosporioides complex from diseased strawberries during 2010 to 2013 in Zhejiang Province, though they were not distinguished at the species level (Lin et al. 2016).
The first use of multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, integrated with morphological characterization by Han et al. (2016), created a new understanding of strawberry anthracnose in China. Based on 11 published works (Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Bi et al. 2017a, b; He et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022) and current research distinguishing species levels, we provided an overview of the population structure and relative prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. in strawberry fields in China (Fig. 3). Since 2016, a total of 492 isolates belonging to 11 Colletotrichum species across four complexes—C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. truncatum—have been identified as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in China.
Analyzing the prevalence of Colletotrichum species revealed that the C. gloeosporioides complex was the most widely reported. Currently, C. siamense (226 isolates, 45.9% of the total) is the most commonly reported species in strawberry fields across a wide range of latitudes in China, distributed in nearly all provinces except Liaoning. This is followed by C. fructicola (189 isolates, 38.4%), which is similarly distributed throughout the country. We acknowledge limitations in the illustration (Fig. 3) due to the availability of data sources. However, the broad prevalence of the C. gloeosporioides complex on strawberries is not limited to China; C. fructicola has also been identified as the predominant fungus causing strawberry anthracnose in both South Korea (Nam et al. 2013) and Japan (Gan et al. 2017).
Notably, the occurrence of C. acutatum s.l., C. boninense s.l., and C. truncatum s.l. species was essentially random in China. Furthermore, C. nymphaeae and C. miaoliense were only identified in temperate zones, including Hebei and Beijing, or from subtropical regions with elevations around 1,000 meters (1,100 meters in Enshi, Hubei; 1,300 meters in Renai; or 960 meters in Shitan, Nantou, Taiwan) (Han et al. 2016; Chung et al. 2020).
The climate is subtropical, characterized by a higher annual average temperature. Latitude and elevation may play roles in influencing temperature variations, which in turn affect the geographic distribution of the Colletotrichum pathogens (Han et al. 2016). The host ranges of C. siamense and C. fructicola, the two most prevalent causal agents of strawberry crown rot, indicate that the vast majority of Colletotrichum fungi are not host-specific but can adapt to a wide range of hosts. This adaptability presents significant challenges in managing Colletotrichum species and mitigating their destructive effects in agricultural production. A comparative analysis of host ranges can partially reflect the prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields.
Among the five Colletotrichum complexes associated with strawberries, the number of host species combinations per complex is as follows: 516 for the C. gloeosporioides complex, 295 for C. acutatum, 129 for C. boninense, 58 for C. truncatium, and 37 for the C. dematium complex (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Clearly, the host range of each Colletotrichum species complex is positively correlated with its prevalence in strawberry fields.
C. siamense and C. fructicola are recognized as the primary pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose crown rot in the Asia-Pacific region (Nam et al. 2013; Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Gan et al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022). These two species are the most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species worldwide (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Both are cosmopolitan fungi that can adapt to a diverse array of host plants, with higher occurrences reported in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia compared to other continents.
In vitro mating studies have shown that C. fructicola is homothallic, while C. siamense is heterothallic (Oliveira et al. 2022). This suggests that C. siamense has a relatively higher capacity for genetic mutations and flexibility, which is congruent with its wider host spectrum compared to C. fructicola.
To provide practical information for the management of strawberry anthracnose, we updated the host ranges of C. fructicola and C. siamense through a search on the Fungal Database (conducted on July 8, 2022, at https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/) and determined the taxonomy of these hosts (conducted on July 15-16, 2022, at https://www.iplant.cn/). This analysis revealed a significantly wider range of hosts for C. siamense and C. fructicola than previously suggested in earlier publications (da Silva et al. 2020; Bhunjun et al. 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).
Accordingly, the host ranges of these two predominant pathogens were sorted based on their taxonomy. A total of 314 and 358 plant host records were obtained for C. fructicola and C. siamense from the Fungal Database (as of July 8, 2022) and Additional File 1: Table S1. Four additional host records of C. siamense, including Datura metel, Dieffenbachia spp. (Araceae), Pongamia pinnata (Fabaceae), and Viola odorata (Violaceae) (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021), were not listed in the Fungal Database but were included in the current analysis.
Since some host records were not determined at the species level, we sorted these hosts at the genus level based on taxonomic analysis from https://www.iplant.cn/. C. siamense is associated with hosts from 111 genera, including one genus of gymnosperm (Cycas), 10 genera of basal angiosperms, 26 genera of monocots, and 74 genera of dicots. The top two orders of plants containing these hosts are Rosales and Malpighiales, each with nine genera, followed by Fabales (8), Sapindales (8), Lamiales (6), Malvales (6), Asparagales (6), and Alismatales (6). In contrast, C. fructicola is associated with hosts from 75 genera, which is a relatively smaller spectrum compared to C. siamense. Notably, no gymnosperms were recorded as hosts for C. fructicola. The top three plant orders hosting this species are Rosales (9 genera), Sapindales (7), and Caryophyllales (6).
Records of plant hosts that are cross-infected or co-infected by multiple Colletotrichum species are not uncommon (Dean et al. 2012; Hirayama et al. 2018; da Silva et al. 2020). Indeed, the co-occurrence of C. fructicola and C. siamense has been identified in the same strawberry production field in Shanghai (Liu et al. 2021). The combined host range of these two Colletotrichum species was expanded to 152 genera, which includes one gymnosperm, 12 angiosperms (from six orders), 38 monocots (from 10 orders), and 101 dicots (from 22 orders). Among the combined hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense, the top four orders are Fabales, Sapindales, Rosales, and Asparagales, each containing 12, 12, 11, and 11 genera, respectively.
Furthermore, there were 34 genera recorded as shared hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense, spanning 19 orders. This includes two genera of basal angiosperms (Annona and Persea), six monocots (Anthurium, Areca, Cymbopogon, Dioscorea, Musa, and Pennisetum), and 26 dicots. Notably, the common hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense comprise seven genera from the order Rosales: Fragaria, Malus, Pyrus, and Prunus from Rosaceae, as well as Artocarpus, Ficus, and Ziziphus.

In this work, we revisited the discovery history of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose and provided a global overview of the genetic diversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries. Currently, 23 species of Colletotrichum are recognized as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa. Two species were rejected due to incorrect citations (C. paranaense) or because they are not pathogenic to strawberries (C. clidemiae). Notably, it has been suggested that about 30% of ITS sequences in open databases, including GenBank, are linked to incorrect taxa of fungi, such as those in the Colletotrichum genus (Hofstetter et al. 2019; Boufleur et al. 2021). Thus, future identification and acceptance of novel species as causal agents of crop anthracnose should be performed rigorously, following the rules of both taxonomy and plant pathology, and should rely not only on multiple barcode genes but also on whole genome sequencing.
Based on published data, we discussed the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in China. C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex are currently the most prevalent. The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift in the prevailing Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in various regions may be linked to global warming, changes in cultivation patterns—from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation—and the substitution of strawberry varieties.
There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.
In 2021, Shanghai experienced its longest summer, lasting 162 days until mid-October, which is 52 days longer than the summer 60 years ago. This extended summer contributed to the outbreak of several diseases, including anthracnose crown rot, leading to increased mortality after transplanting in strawberry production fields. It is concerning to speculate that global warming may exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, changes in temperature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the specific responses of the disease triangle to these variations (Velásquez et al. 2018). In an era of anthropogenic habitat modification and climate change, we must consider how to mitigate the impacts of global warming on sustainable strawberry development.
To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.
