pei‑che chung1,2, Hung‑Yi Wu2, Yen‑Wen Wang2, Hiran A. Ariyawansa2, Hsien‑pin Hu2, ting‑Hsuan Hung2*, Shean‑Shong tzean2* & chia‑Lin chung2*Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates, but knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. to investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018, and Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis with internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms/nurseries in taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species C. siamense and C. fructicola exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on wounded and non‑wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will help in disease management and resistance breeding.

Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) is a popular small fruit crop with high economic and nutritive value. Strawberry is in high demand globally. From 2008 to 2018, the annual worldwide cultivation of strawberries increased from approximately 400 to 483 thousand  hectares1. Although strawberries are native to temperate regions, they can also be grown in tropical and subtropical regions (sometimes under high-altitude conditions). The land areas devoted to strawberry cultivation in Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Taiwan in 2018 were 1,482 ha, 1,453 ha, 690 ha, 522 ha, and 506 ha,  respectively1.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm and humid  climates2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidemics of strawberry anthracnose  disease3. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, then penetrate the epidermal  cells4. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, causing black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, and wilting of the whole plant due to crown  rot2. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the  field2. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, and the high temperature, high humidity and heavy rainfall during open1Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Miaoli County  36346,  Taiwan.  2Department  of  Plant  Pathology  and  Microbiology,  National  Taiwan  University,  Taipei City 10617, Taiwan. *email: thhung@ntu.edu.tw; sst@ntu.edu.tw; clchung@ntu.edu.twhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1038/s41598-020-70878-2&domain=pdf2Vol:.(1234567890)Scientific RepoRtS |        (2020) 10:14664  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70878-2www.nature.com/scientificreports/this period provide a suitable environment for epidemics. From 2010 to 2016, anthracnose crown rot caused the loss of 30–40% of seedlings and ~ 20% of plants after  transplanting5.

Colletotrichum spp. have traditionally been classified based on the shape of the conidia and appressorium, the presence of a seta or perithecium, and culture  characteristics6,7. Using these criteria, early studies reported C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae as strawberry anthracnose  pathogens2,8. However, Colletotrichum spp. share similar features, and morphological characteristics can be influenced by environmental factors including culture media, light, and  temperature9−11. Therefore, a polyphasic approach based on morphology and genetic characteristics was proposed for identification of Colletotrichum  species9. A combination of multiple gene sequences, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT ), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), can provide more molecular features to resolve different species in a Colletotrichum species  complex12,13. Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex) and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex)6,12–18.

Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to be C. gloeosporioides19, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Plant Protection Information System; https ://otser v2.tactr i.gov.tw/ppm/), but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and sequences of these species is not sufficient for species identification. Recently, based on analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown  rot5. To provide accurate information for disease control and resistance breeding, in this study we aimed to reveal the population composition of the infectious agents associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. Samples collected from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan from 2010 to 2018 were subjected to morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at different temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium as well as the ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the  UK14 and China [Anhui, Hainan (only one isolate), Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces and Beijing and Shanghai  cities]16–18, which, with the exception of Hainan, are geographical regions located at higher latitudes (30–53°N) relative to Taiwan (24.5°N), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose disease in subtropical regions.

ResultsMolecular identification and phylogenetic analysis. Colletotrichum spp. isolates were first identified at the species complex level. Among 52 Colletotrichum spp. isolates sampled from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan, 45 (86.5%) isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 4 (7.7%) belonged to the C. boninense species complex, and 3 (5.8%) belonged to the C. acutatum species complex (Table 1).

To further analyze the C. acutatum species complex, 3 isolates together with 40 reference isolates, including the outgroup C. orchidophilum (CBS 632.80), were used to construct phylogenetic trees with five gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , and TUB2) (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1) following Damm et al.12 and Fu et al.20. The final data matrix contained a total of 1,821 characters with gaps (ITS: 1–540, GAPDH: 541–799, CHS-1: 800–1,081, ACT : 1,082–1,329, TUB2: 1,330–1,821), of which 237 characters were parsimony informative, 174 parsimony uninformative, and 1,410 constant. After 2,000,000 generations of topological convergence via Bayesian inference (BI) analysis, 2,378 trees were obtained. The first 25% of the trees were discarded, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, and the remaining trees were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree (Fig. 1). The maximum likelihood (ML) analysis resulted in a best scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of − 6,726.174303. The most parsimonious tree resulted from the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis received tree length = 692, consistency index (CI) = 0.714, and retention index (RI) = 0.843. All three isolates (ML1040, ML1042, ML1794) were grouped in a distinct clade with significant statistical support in the multilocus phylogenetic analysis (1/100/100, BI/ML/MP) (Fig. 1) and the single gene trees of GAPDH, CHS-1, and TUB2 (Supplementary Fig. S1). This clade was distinct from all other known species, and is herein described as a new species, C. miaoliense sp. nov.

To analyze the phylogeny of the C. boninense species complex, six gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, and CAL) from 4 isolates together with 31 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878), were used to construct phylogenetic trees (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The final data matrix contained a total of 2,363 characters with gaps (ITS: 1–558, GAPDH: 559–852, CHS-1: 853–1,132, ACT : 1,133–1,411, TUB2: 1,412–1,914, CAL: 1,915–2,363), of which 365 characters were parsimony informative, 407 parsimony uninformative, and 1,591 constant. After 1,187,000 generations of topological convergence via BI analysis, 492 trees were obtained. The first 25% of the trees were discarded, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, and the remaining trees were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree (Fig. 2). The ML analysis resulted in a best scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of − 10,025.941645. The most parsimonious tree resulted from the MP analysis received tree length = 1,281, CI = 0.774, and RI = 0.839. In single gene trees of GAPDH, CHS-1, and TUB2 and the multilocus phylogenetic tree, three isolates (ML351, 442, 1792) clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CGMCC 3.14194 and other related isolates of C. karstii (Fig. 2; single gene trees https://otserv2.tactri.gov.tw/ppm/3Vol.:(0123456789)Scientific RepoRtS |        (2020) 10:14664  |

In single gene trees of GAPDH and CAL and the multilocus phylogenetic tree, the isolate ML521 clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 123755 and other related isolates of C. boninense (Fig. 2; single gene trees not shown).

To identify species in the C. gloeosporioides species complex, a combination of seven gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL and ApMAT) from 45 isolates together with 47 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. boninense (CBS 123755), were used to construct phylogenetic trees (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The final data matrix contained a total of 3,571 characters with gaps (ITS: 1–553, GAPDH: 554–808, CHS-1: 809–1,051, ACT : 1,052–1,325, TUB2: 1,326–2,028, CAL: 2,029–2,728, ApMAT: 2,729–3,571), of which 655 characters were parsimony informative, 735 parsimony uninformative, and 2,181 constant. After 6,574,000 generations of topological convergence via BI analysis, 9,864 trees were obtained. The first 25% of the trees were discarded, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, and the remaining trees were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree (Fig. 3). The ML analysis resulted in a best scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of − 18,514.217014. The most parsimonious tree resulted from the MP analysis received tree length = 2,400, CI = 0.722, and RI = 0.876.

Known distribution: Miaoli and Nantou Counties, Taiwan.Notes Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multilocus analysis indicated that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade clearly distinct from all the other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Of the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) that have been reported as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is phylogenetically most closely related to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in the size of conidia (16.1 ± 2.3 × 4.9 ± 0.7 µm versus 14.2 ± 1.1 × 4.1 ± 0.34 µm), the shape of conidia (one end round and one end rounded to acute in contrast to the new species, in which both ends are acute), the size of appressoria (8.7 ± 2.5 × 5.5 ± 1.0 versus 7.5 ± 1.

Compared with C. simmondsii, the conidia of C. miaoliense are longer (mean length 14.2 µm versus 8.1 µm). In addition, the conidia of C. simmondsii are cylindrical with one end round and one end acute or both ends acute. Although the appressoria of C. miaoliense and C. simmondsii are similar in shape and L/W ratio, the appressoria of C. simmondsii are larger (Supplementary Table S2).Effect of temperature on mycelial growth. A representative isolate selected from each of five Colletotrichum species was grown on PDA at 18 °C to 32 °C. The maximum growth rate of C. siamense ML133 was Figure 4.

The growth rate of C. boninense ML521 drastically decreased at 32 °C (Fig. 5). C. miaoliense ML1040 exhibited the slowest growth rate at all tested temperature regimes except 32 °C (Fig. 5). The ranking of species by growth rates at higher temperatures (28 °C, 30 °C and 32 °C) is as follows: C. siamense ML133 > C. fructicola ML348 > C. karstii ML351 and C. boninense ML521 (28 °C and 30 °C) > C. miaoliense ML1040 > C. boninense ML521 (32 °C) (Fig. 5 and Supplementary Table S3).The growth rates of C. siamense ML133 were also compared with those of another two representative isolates selected from C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense (Supplementary Table S4). The ranking of isolates by mycelial growth rates at both 25 °C and 30 °C on PDA was as follows: C. siamense ML133 and ML540 > C. siamense ML612 and C. fructicola ML368 > C. fructicola ML356 and C. karstii ML1792 > C. karstii ML442 > C. miaoliense ML1042 and ML1794.pathogenicity assay. Pathogenicity was tested using Koch’s postulates for C. siamense ML133, C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040. These isolates all caused leaf and/or crown necrosis in strawberry seedlings (Fig. S6). C. siamense ML133 caused the most severe symptoms with 100% disease incidence. The disease incidences for C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were only 30%, 30%, 30% and 50%, respectively. Notably, after spray inoculation of the seedlings with C. karstii ML351, leaf spots scarcely occurred, and no leaf lesions were observed for C. boninense ML521. Even though there were few visible symptoms, C. boninense ML521 could be re-isolated from surface-sterilized inoculated leaves.

Virulence of the five selected isolates was subsequently assayed using wounded and non-wounded detached leaves at 25 °C and 30 °C (Fig. 6). For all five isolates, inoculation of wounded leaves resulted in typical anthracnose lesions, which were first observed at 2–4 days post inoculation (dpi). C. siamense ML133 caused the largest brown necrotic lesions, sometimes with chlorotic or reddish margins (Fig. 6a). The necrotic lesions caused by C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were significantly smaller (Fig. 6b; C. fructicola ML348 was slightly more virulent than C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040). At 7 dpi, C. siamense ML133 caused significantly larger lesions at 30 °C (1.26 cm in diameter) than 25 °C (0.65 cm in diameter), whereas the sizes of lesions caused by other Colletotrichum species were similar (0.07–0.35 cm in diameter) at different temperatures (Fig. 6b).

In regard to inoculations of unwounded leaves, necrotic lesions caused by C. siamense ML133 and C. fructicola ML348 first appeared at 4–7 dpi, but no lesions occurred in the plants inoculated with the other three Colletotrichum spp. isolates (Fig. 6a). Inoculation of unwounded leaves with C. siamense ML133 resulted in larger lesions than inoculation with the other Colletotrichum spp., and the lesion sizes at 14 dpi were significantly larger at 30 °C (1.35 cm in diameter) than at 25 °C (0.35 cm in diameter) (Fig. 6c).

Inoculations of wounded leaves were conducted at 30 °C for C. siamense ML133, C. boninense ML521, and two additional representative isolates of C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense (Fig. S7). The results showed that C. siamense (ML133, ML540, ML612) and C. fructicola ML356 caused significantly larger lesions (1.21–1.74 cm in diameter at 7 dpi; 3.06–3.47 cm in diameter at 14 dpi) than C. fructicola ML368, C. karstii (ML442, ML1792), and C. miaoliense (ML1042, ML1794) (0.42–0.76 cm in diameter at 7 dpi; 1.06–2.15 cm in diameter at 14 dpi).

Cryptic taxa identification is progressing rapidly and groups of fungi, including important plant pathogens, are now mainly classified using molecular data-based phylogenetic inference. For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20  species12,13,21. Several Colletotrichum spp. with the capacity to cause strawberry anthracnose in temperate regions have been  reported12–15,17,22–30; however, knowledge of the composition of the pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. Through morphological characterization, phylogenetic analyses involving five to seven loci (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT), and inoculation tests on strawberry seedlings and detached leaves, the present study revealed that five Colletotrichum species cause strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. In addition to the known strawberry anthracnose Figure 6.  Inoculation of Colletotrichum spp. on detached wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves at different temperatures.

For each species, the difference between 25 °C and 30 °C was analyzed by Student’s t test (*denotes P < 0.05).

C. karstii was previously isolated from a wide range of plants such as anthurium, apple, citrus, and chili  pepper21,32,33, but not from strawberry. In this study, C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C miaoliense were isolated from different tissues, and all five Colletotrichum species were proved to be pathogenic to strawberry leaves and crowns (Fig. S6). The lack of tissue specificity is in agreement with previous observations of C. acutatum in  strawberry2,34.

The predominance of C. siamense (75%) and C. fructicola (11%) in the strawberry anthracnose pathogen population in Taiwan can be attributed to their higher levels of pathogenicity and aggressiveness. While all five Colletotrichum spp. were pathogenic to wounded leaves, only C. siamense and C. fructicola were able to cause lesions on non-wounded leaves. In addition, C. siamense (ML133, ML540, ML612) and C. fructicola (ML356) caused significantly larger lesions at 25 °C and 30 °C (Fig. 6 and Fig. S7). A similar phenomenon was observed for Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, China (latitude ~ 30°N)18: C. fructicola (53% of the isolates) and C. siamense (23%) dominated the population, and C. fructicola exhibited the highest level of pathogenicity (only 25 °C was tested)18. Although C. boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense were much less virulent, wounds caused by natural agencies (wind, rain, insects and animals) as well as human activities (e.g., trimming old leaves, which is a common agricultural practice employed by most strawberry farmers in Taiwan) would provide potential infection sites allowing these pathogens to bypass the first line of defense (e.g., the cuticle)35–37 in strawberry.

Among the five Colletotrichum species identified in this study, C. siamense exhibited greater mycelial growth rates on PDA, especially at higher temperatures. The fitness advantage of C. siamense in warm temperature weather may explain its current geographical distribution. In the literature, C. siamense was most reported in tropical and subtropical  regions13,16,38, whereas C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. karstii were reported in regions across a wide range of  latitudes13,20,21,33,39–41. Temperature is among the key environmental factors affecting a pathogen’s  survival42. A recent study based on published observations of 612 crop pests and pathogens from 1960 onwards revealed significant positive latitudinal shifts of many important pests and pathogens under climate  change43. More research on the genetic and biological characteristics of different Colletotrichum species from diverse geographical areas will be needed to understand the emergence and spread of anthracnose diseases. With rising global temperatures, it will be particularly important to monitor the expansion of the heat-adapted C. siamense toward high latitudes.

C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in different countries/regions13,21. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and  chili44,45, C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and  mango46,47, C. karstii in passion  fruit48, and C. boninense in  pitaya49. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum spp. from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could not only infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean but also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp.50. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum31. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize the primary infection in the field, it is worth investigating whether the five Colletotrichum spp. we identified could colonize the weeds commonly present in and nearby strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be required to understand the host range of the new species C. miaoliense.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other areas. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50–80%2,18,51,52. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings offer precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening of resistant varieties and development of effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether it was inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30 °C than 25 °C, which is meaningful in subtropical Taiwan and areas with a similar phenology. Because no significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, higher disease severity at 30 °C could be due to reduced resistance of strawberry against anthracnose at higher  temperatures53,54. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Development of temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be particularly important for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating the fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to aid the production of strawberry seedlings without latent infection of major Colletotrichum species.

MethodsSample collection and pathogen isolation. From 2010 to 2018, different strawberry tissues (including the leaf, stolon, fruit, root and crown) showing anthracnose disease symptoms were collected from 24 farms and nurseries located in Miaoli, Hsinchu, Nantou, and Chiayi Counties in Taiwan. From 2009 to 2018, the strawberry-cultivated areas in Miaoli, Hsinchu, Nantou, and Chiayi accounted for approximately 89.6%, 2.8%, 2.6%, and 0.2% of the total strawberry-cultivated area in Taiwan, respectively. Pure cultures of all fungal isolates were obtained by the single hyphal tip isolation method. Approximately 2 × 2 mm fragments bordering healthy and necrotic zones in diseased tissues were surface-sterilized with 0.5–1% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with sterile deionized water three times, then placed onto 1.5% water agar. After 2–3 days of incubation at 25 °C, single hyphal tips were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA, BD Difco) and cultured for further use. A total of 52 Colletotrichum spp. isolates were used in this study (Table 1): 26 (50%) isolated from crowns, 11 (21.2%) from leaves, 5 (9.6%) from fruits, 5 (9.6%) from roots, and 5 (9.6%) from stolons (Table 1). Type specimens in this 13Vol.:(0123456789)Scientific RepoRtS |        (2020) 10:14664  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70878-2www.nature.com/scientificreports/study were deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University (NTUH). Ex-type living cultures were deposited in the Culture Collection of the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University (NTUCC), Bioresource and Collection Research Center (BCRC), and Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station. Nomenclature and taxonomic information were deposited in  MycoBank55 (www.mycob ank.org). Colletotrichum spp. were preserved as mycelium discs in  ddH2O at 4 °C for short-term storage and in 10% glycerol with 5% lactose at − 80 °C for long term storage. Before conducting experiments, each isolate was revived by culturing on PDA for 5–7 days at 25 °C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod.

DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing. For each Colletotrichum spp. isolate, the mycelium was taken from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA medium. The mycelium was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder using a sterile mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System Kit (VIOGENE) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Seven genetic fragments, namely ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT, were amplified with the primers listed in Supplementary Table S5 using the Biometra Thermal Cycler (Biometra TRIO). Each PCR reaction contained 1 μl of genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 5 μl of 10X reaction buffer [with Tris–HCl (pH 9.0), PCR enhancers,  (NH4)2SO4, 20 mM  MgCl2], 2 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mM each), 1 µl of 10 μM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 μM reverse primer, 0.5 μl (2.5 U) of Prime Taq DNA Polymerase (GenetBio Inc.), and 39.5 μl of  ddH2O. The thermal cycling parameters were 1 cycle of 95 °C for 4 min and 30–35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52–62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s followed by a final extension step of 72 °C for 7 min. The optimal annealing temperatures for different genetic regions were: ITS: 58 °C, GAPDH: 52 °C, CHS-1: 58 °C, ACT : 58 °C, TUB2: 58 °C, CAL: 59 °C, and ApMAT: 62 °C. Amplicons were bidirectionally sequenced using the dideoxy termination method on the ABI 3730 DNA Analyzer (Tri-I Biotech, Taiwan). Raw sequence chromatograms were manually examined, and the sequences of each fragment were assembled in ApE v2.0.55 (A Plasmid Editor, M. Wayne Davis at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City, UT).Multilocus phylogenetic analysis and species recognition. Newly generated sequences from each isolate were blasted against the GenBank nr database, and searches were restricted to type materials for initial determination of the closest matching species and species complex. Related gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT) of Colletotrichum spp. from recent publications were downloaded from  GenBank12,13,21. For each gene, sequences from the isolates belonging to the same species complex were aligned using the MAFFT v7 online server (https ://mafft .cbrc.jp/align ment/serve r/)56. The aligned sequences were manually edited using MEGA  v1057 to improve the alignment. The post-alignment sequences of multiple genes/loci were concatenated in a text editor.

BI, ML, and MP approaches for each individual locus and the concatenated sequences were used to identify closely related taxa. Best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were selected using the Akaike information criterion implemented in MrModeltest v.2.458 and run in PAUP v.4.059 (Supplementary Table S6). BI analyses were performed using MrBayes v.3.2.660. Two independent analyses of four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains (3 heated, 1 cold) were run from a random tree for 2 × 106 (for the C. acutatum species complex), 4 × 106 (for the C. boninense species complex), and 6 × 106 (for the C. gloeosporioides species complex) generations or until the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. The analysis was sampled every 1,000 generations, and the first 25% of the generations were discarded as burn-in. The effective sample size and convergence were monitored with Tracer v1.7.161. MP analyses were performed in PAUP v.4.059 using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection branch swapping and 100 random sequence addition. Maxtrees were set to 5,000 and bootstrap analysis was performed with 1,000 replicates. ML analyses were performed in RAxML v8.2.1062 using the GTR-gamma substitution model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.3. The concatenated alignments and phylogenetic trees were deposited in TreeBASE (www.treeb ase.org) with the study ID 26665.

We applied the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR)  method63,64 for species delimitation of Colletotrichum taxa. A novel species was considered novel the clade was strongly supported as monophyletic by BI (posterior probability ≥ 0.95), ML (bootstrap ≥ 70%), and MP (bootstrap ≥ 70%) analyses in the multilocus phylogenetic tree and in the majority of individual gene trees.

Morphological characterization. Morphological characterization of one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species was conducted following the procedures of Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012)12,13,21. Cultures were grown on PDA and 1/4-strength PDA (1/4 PDA)65 for 2–3 weeks at 25 °C and 30 °C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. (Our preliminary tests showed that compared with PDA, the low nutrient medium 1/4 PDA could stimulate sporulation without affecting the size and shape of conidia.) The experiment was performed in two independent trials, each consisting of two to three plates per isolate. Conidiomata were investigated using a dissecting microscope (Leica M125). Conidia, conidiophores, setae, asci, ascomata and appressoria were examined using a light microscope (Leica DM2500). To induce the formation of appressoria, 20–30 µl of conidial suspension (prepared using sterile  dH2O) was dropped onto a microscope slide, covered with a cover slip, then incubated in a moist chamber at 25 °C for 2–3  days39. The lengths and widths of 55 conidiogenous cells, 100 conidia and 30 appressoria were measured using ImageJ  software66.

Effect of temperature on mycelial growth. Mycelium-agar discs (6 mm in diameter) were cut with a sterilized cork borer from the advancing edge of 5- to 7-day-old Colletotrichum spp. colonies then placed (with the mycelium-side down) onto the center of a 90 mm petri dish containing 25 ml PDA. Colony diameters were http://www.mycobank.orghttps://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/http://www.treebase.org14Vol:.(1234567890)Scientific RepoRtS |        (2020) 10:14664  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70878-2www.nature.com/scientificreports/measured after 7 days of incubation at different temperatures under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod in a growth chamber (Firstek, GC-560H). The mycelial growth rate (mm/day) was calculated as “(the diameter of the colony—the diameter of the mycelium-agar disc) / 7”. For one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species, the mycelial growth rates at 18 °C, 22 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, 30 °C, and 32 °C were determined in two to three independent trials, each consisting of three PDA plates per isolate per temperature. The optimum temperature for the mycelial growth rate was estimated based on the Gaussian process (4 parameter) for nonlinear regression in SigmaPlot 14 (Systat Software, San Jose, CA). Growth of an additional two representative isolates of each Colletotrichum species, selected from distinct subclades within the species based on the multilocus phylogenetic analysis, was measured at 25 °C and 30 °C in two independent trials, each consisting of four PDA plates per isolate per temperature.

pathogenicity assay. The susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ was used for all inoculation tests in this study. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. (one isolate from each Colletotrichum species) was examined via Koch’s postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff  (106 spores/ml), and also applying 1 ml of spore suspension  (106 spores/ml) on the crown region after removal of one to two old leaves. After inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags (> 90% relative humidity) for 3 days at 30 °C and then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30 °C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. The fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased tissues (as mentioned above using the single hypha tip isolation method), then identified based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequences as described above.

The virulence levels of different Colletotrichum spp. isolates were determined by inoculation of wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Fully expanded healthy leaves were collected from strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage. For inoculation of wounded leaves, each leaflet was punctured with a sterile syringe needle on the left and right sides of the midrib, and 10 μl of a spore suspension (1 × 106 spores/ml) was deposited on the left wound site, and sterile  dH2O was deposited on the right wound site as a control. Similarly, inoculations of non-wounded leaves were performed in the same way as mentioned above. After inoculation, the leaves were kept in a moist chamber (a plastic box with  dH2O at the bottom; the cut end of the petiole was submerged in the water) at 25 °C or 30 °C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. Lesion size was measured at 7 and 14 days post inoculation (dpi). Lesions smaller than 0.1 cm in diameter were considered unsuccessful infections. The same isolates for the “effect of temperature on mycelial growth” test were used for the pathogenicity assay. For one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species, inoculations of wounded and non-wounded leaves were performed at 25 °C and 30 °C in three independent trials, each consisting of 12 leaflets (4 leaves from 4 seedlings) per isolate per treatment. An additional two representative isolates of each Colletotrichum species, selected from distinct subclades within the species based on the multilocus phylogenetic analysis, were used for wound inoculation at 30 °C. The experiment was performed in two independent trials, each consisting of 12 leaflets (4 leaves from 4 seedlings) per isolate per treatment.

Statistical analysis. Data were analyzed by analysis of variance (ANOVA) using the software SPSS v18. Tukey’s range test or Student’s t-test was used to test for significant differences among or between different treatments at a significance threshold of P < 0.05.

Nyoho cultivated under a noncirculation hydroponics systemwere determined after inoculation with  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides . Crop growth and tissue nitrogen, phosphorus,potassium and calcium contents of the entire above-ground parts of the plant were also investigated. Elevated nitrogenand potassium concentrations in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity in contrast to phosphorus and calcium.

Treatment with either NH 4  or NO 3  nitrogen was not significantly different. The dry weight of the strawberry plantsincreased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen ( R 2  = 0·9078) and phosphorus ( R 2  = 0·8842), but wasnot influenced by the elevated amounts of potassium ( R 2  = 0·8587) and calcium ( R 2  = 0·6526) concentrations.

 Keywords : Colletotrichum gloeosporioides , disease severity, fertilizer, macronutrients, strawberry anthracnose  Introduction In Korea, strawberries ( Fragaria   ×   ananassa ) are favouredfor winter cultivation when the production of other vegetables and fruits is relatively low. In 2003 strawberrieswere planted on a total area of 7503 ha in Korea, withplastic greenhouse cultivation comprising 7172 ha andproduction for fresh market totalling 205 427 tonnes(Anonymous, 2004). The use of forcing, where strawberries are transplanted into greenhouses in mid-Septemberand forced into fruiting in December (Oda, 1991), isincreasing in Korea. June-bearing cultivars such as Maehyang, Akihime and Nyoho used for forcing have provendifficult to grow due to their susceptibility to anthracnose(Nam  et al ., 1998; Kim & Nam, 1999). Anthracnose isone of the most damaging diseases of strawberries, causing wilting and death of transplants in the nursery field.

The pathogen known to be responsible for the disease inKorea is  Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  and was initiallyreported in 1992 (Kim  et al ., 1992).

The nutritional status of a plant has a major impact onsusceptibility to disease, and this has been exploited forthe reduction of disease severity (Huber & Watson, 1974;Engelhard, 1989; Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993). In particular, nitrogen, and the form of nitrogen used, can beinfluential. For example, black root rot complex ( Rhizoctonia fragariae / Pratylenchus penetrans ) of strawberrieswas suppressed by application of (NH 4 ) 2 SO 4  (Elmer &LaMondia, 1999), and  C. phomoides  was controlledusing NH 4 -N fertilizer (Williams, 1965). However, theseverity of fusarium disease of tomato (Duffy & Dèfago,1999) and anthracnose ( C. gossypii ) of cotton (Huber &Watson, 1974) was elevated with NH 4 -N. Similarly, riceblast disease ( Magnaporthe grisea ) is exacerbated in thepresence of excess nitrogen (Teng, 1994). In contrast,when calcium was applied, tomato showed increasedresistance to fusarium wilt (Woltz  et al ., 1992).

Little is currently known about the influence of plantnutrition on anthracnose of strawberry. The purpose ofthis study was to investigate the effects of concentration ofnitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium on thedevelopment of strawberry anthracnose, with the aim ofdeveloping practical strategies to manage the disease.

 Materials and methods Plant preparation Tissue-cultured seedlings of strawberry cv. Nyoho at thethree-leaf stage were transplanted into 15 cm (1·6 L) plastic pots containing perlite. Transplants were irrigated fora month with distilled water to leach out nutrients contained in the perlite. This also lowered the tissue nutrientcontent of the strawberry plants. Following this, plants *E-mail: hgkim@cnu.ac.kr Accepted 13 August 2005 © 2006 BSPP Plant Pathology  (2006)  55 , 246–249 Effects of N, P, K and Ca on strawberry anthracnose 247were watered with the nutrient treatment solution every2 days for 50 days.

 Nutrient solutions Hoagland nutrient solution (Hoagland & Arnon, 1950)was modified to make treatment solutions containing 0, 5,10, 15, 20 and 30 m m  nitrogen; 0, 0·25, 0·5, 0·75, 1 and3 m m  phosphorus; 0, 10, 20 and 30 m m  potassium; or 0,1·5, 3, 4·5 and 6·0 m m  calcium. The composition andchemical sources of micronutrients are shown in Table 1.

The pH of all treatment solutions were adjusted to 6·5using 1 N HCl or KOH. The effect of the form of nitrogenwas tested by comparing 5, 10 and 15 m m  nitrate andammonium compounds.

 Cultural practice The experimental design was a completely randomizedplot with five replications. Pots were placed 25 cm apartin rows. The experiment was conducted in a glasshousewith a temperature range of 17–18 ° C at night and 24–28 ° C during the day. The relative humidity ranged from40 to 80%, and daylight intensity from 550 to 1200 molm − 2  s − 1  during the experimental period.

 Plant analysis Plant tissue was sampled from shoots after 1 month ofnutrient solution treatments. Tissue samples were washedwith 0·2 N HCl for 1 min, rinsed with distilled water,dried for 2 days at 70 ° C, and ground in a Wiley mill to passthrough the 1 mm particle size sieve. Total N was determined by a modified Kjeldahl procedure which includeda salicylic acid pretreatment to aid in the reduction of NO 3 (Eastin, 1978). Tissue used for P, K and Ca analysiswas dry-ashed at 500 ° C, dehydrated in HCl and finallydissolved in 0·5 N HCl. Analysis of K and Ca was done byatomic absorption spectrometry, and colorimetric analysiswas performed for P (Chapman & Pratt, 1961).

 Inoculation and disease assessment Growth characteristics were determined for plants after1 month of nutrient solution treatments. Inoculum of C. gloeosporioides  (CGF43) was prepared at 10 6  conidiamL − 1  and sprayed on the plants. The inoculated plantswere incubated in dew chamber at 30 ° C and 100% RHfor 2 days and then moved to a glasshouse held between24 and 28 ° C (Gupton & Smith, 1991). After 17 days, thedisease severity on each plant was rated. Disease severitywas rated as a disease index (DI) on a scale of 0–4, asfollows: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% of petioles affected; 2,  ≥  50%of petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on entireplants (Ishikawa  et al ., 1989).

 Data analysis Data from nutrient concentrations and different nitrogensource trials were subjected to analysis of variance, andtreatment means were compared by Duncan’s multiplerange test at  P  = 0·05. The relationships between nutrientconcentrations and dry weight, and nutrient concentrations and disease index, were evaluated using regressionanalysis (Duffy & Dèfago, 1999; Choi  et al ., 2000). Alldata analysis was performed using the SAS program (SASInstitute, Inc., USA). Results and discussion Dry weight of strawberry plants was greatest when providedwith 30 m m  nitrogen, 1 m m  phosphorus, 10 m m  potassium,and 3 m m  calcium (Table 2).

Anthracnose symptoms first appeared in the nitrogentreatment approximately 2 weeks after inoculation. Apositive correlation (adjusted (Adj)  R 2  = 0·96) was foundbetween nitrogen concentration of treatment solution andanthracnose disease (Fig. 1a). Disease was greatest (DI ∼ 3) at a nitrogen concentration of 30 m m . Anthracnosetended to be more severe in treatments receiving NH 4  thanNO 3 , but these differences were not significant accordingto Duncan’s multiple range test ( P =  0·05) (Fig. 2). A similarpositive relationship (adjusted  R 2  = 0·84) between diseaseand potassium concentration of treatment solution wasshown, with a maximum DI of  ∼ 3 at 30 m m  potassiumTable 1 Composition of nutrient solutions applied to strawberry plants Treatment (mM)Nutrient N P K Ca Mg SO4N0 0 2 14 5 2 55 5 2 14 5 2 510 10 1 14 5 2 515 15 1 14 5 2 520 20 1 14 5 2 530 30 1 14 5 2 5P0 15 0 15 5 2 50·25 15 0·25 14·25 5 2 50·5 15 0·5 14·5 5 2 50·75 15 0·75 14·75 5 2 51 15 1 15 5 2 53 15 3 17 5 2 5K0 15 1 0 5 2 210 15 1 10 5 2 220 15 1 20 5 2 430 15 1 30 5 2 6Ca0 15 1 15 0 2 21·5 15 1 15 1·5 2 23·0 15 1 15 3·0 2 24·5 15 1 15 4·5 2 26·0 15 1 15 6·0 2 2The following micronutrients were applied to all pots: MnCl2·4H2O (1·8 g L−1), H3BO3 (2·86 g L−1), ZnSO4·7H2O (0·22 g L−1), CuSO4·5H2O (0·08 g L−1), H2MoO4·H2O (0·09 g L−1), Na2FeEDTA (0·79 g L−1). 13653059, 2006, 2, Downloaded from https://bsppjournals.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1365-3059.2006.01322.x by National Yang Ming Chiao Tung University, Wiley Online Library on [20/07/2024].

(Fig. 1c). In contrast, neither increasing concentrationsof calcium ( P =  0·62) nor those of phosphorus ( P =  0·68)had a patterned effect on disease (Fig. 1b and d). For alltreatments, the relative dry matter content of each nutrientin the test plants increased with increasing concentrationin the treatment solution (Fig. 1).

Previous studies have shown correlations betweennitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose, as inthe case of cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Previously,Choi  et al . (2000) showed that, as tissue nitrogen contentdecreased, Ca and Mn contents, which have a direct rolein phenolic metabolism, increased in the strawberry. Manganese may increase synthesis of host defence productsand thereby reduce disease incidence and/or severity(Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993), whilst calcium has beenshown to inhibit anthracnose (caused by  C. gloeosporioides  or  C. acutatum ) in apples (Biggs, 1999) and decreasepostharvest disease development on strawberry (Cheour et al ., 1990). Woltz  et al . (1992) also found that treatmentwith CaCO 3  (3·0 kg m − 3 ) in tomato reduced fusariumcrown rot disease. Calcium may be important for resistance against certain cell-wall-degrading enzymes produced by fungal pathogens (Conway & Sams, 1984; Biggs& Peterson, 1990). However, in this study, no effect wasfound of calcium content on anthracnose disease in strawberry. As manganese content is increased under low nitrogen conditions in plants, additional work is needed todetermine whether manganese levels are related to anthracnose development. Phosphorus supplied as phosphite waseffective at reducing phytophthora root and crown roton tomato and pepper plants but also suppressed plantgrowth (Förster  et al ., 1998).

Strawberry prefers NH4 to NO3 nitrogen for optimalgrowth (Park, 1990). Other studies have shown the useof the former increases cotton anthracnose (Bollenbacher& Fulton, 1971) and fusarium crown rot severity (Woltzet al., 1992) more than the use of nitrate. It was foundon average that strawberry plants receiving ammoniumnitrogen had more disease than those receiving nitratetreatments, but these differences were not significant.

It has been shown that increasing nitrogen and potassium in nutrient solutions resulted in higher dry matterpercentages of both elements in strawberry but alsoincreased the severity of anthracnose. To decrease anthracnose in strawberries, it is suggested that a minimum ofnitrogen and potassium should be present in any fertilizerused and that this should not exceed 15 and 10 units ofnitrogen and potassium, respectively.

Epidemiology and Pathology of Strawberry Anthracnose:A North American PerspectiveBarbara J. Smith1U.S. Department of Agriculture, Agricultural Research Service, Thad Cochran Southern Horticultural Laboratory,Small Fruit Research Unit, P.O. Box 287, Poplarville, MS 39470Additional index words. Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, Fragaria ·ananassa, disease control, fungicidesAbstract. Three Colletotrichum species—Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (teleomorph Glomerella acutata J.C.Guerber & J.C. Correll), Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. inPenz. [teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk]—are major pathogens of strawberry (Fragaria·ananassa). Strawberry anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease in commercial strawberry fields in thesoutheastern United States since the 1930s. The causal fungus, C. fragariae, may infect all aboveground plant parts;however, the disease is most severe when the fungus infects the crown, causing crown rot, wilt, and death. Colletotrichumgloeosporioides was responsible for an epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry nurseries in Arkansas and NorthCarolina in the late 1970s. The anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported in 1986 on strawberry in theUnited States. Since the 1980s, increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the United States may be relatedto changes in cultivars and to widespread use of annual plasticulture production rather than the matted-row productionsystem. Anthracnose investigations in the United States have concentrated on its epidemiology and differences among thethree causal Colletotrichum spp. in their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics; their infection processes;and their pathogenicity. Results from these studies have resulted in a better understanding of the diseases and have led tobetter disease control. Strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels are more susceptible to anthracnose than arethose grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those amended with calcium nitrate. Anthracnose is spread more rapidlyin fields that have overhead irrigation and plastic mulch than in fields where drip irrigation and straw mulch are used.

Fungicide efficacy has been determined in in-vitro, greenhouse, and field studies, and pathogen resistance to somefungicides has been detected. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars are a major objective of most strawberry breeding programsin the southern United States.Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases of many fruit and vegetable cropsworldwide, and three species, C. fragariae,C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, causeanthracnose diseases of strawberry (Smithand Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae andC. gloeosporioides has been a destructivedisease in strawberry nurseries and fruitproduction fields in the southeastern UnitedStates (Brooks, 1931). In 1986, the presenceof the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen,C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberryin the United States (Smith and Black, 1986).

Increased losses due to anthracnose fruit andcrown rots in the United States since the1980s may be related to the shift frommatted-row culture to the annual plasticultureproduction system, as well as to changes incultivars. Anthracnose diseases are increasing in importance and resulting in majoreconomic losses to strawberry growersworldwide. The objective of this report is tosummarize anthracnose related research fromthe United States (excluding research fromCalifornia and Florida) so that we can betterunderstand these diseases and their control.

ANTHRACNOSE PATHOGENSColletotrichum fragariae, C. acutatum,and C. gloeosporioides (Howard et al.,1992; Smith, 1998a, 1988b, 1988c) causeanthracnose diseases of strawberries. C. fragariae was assumed to be the causal agent ofstrawberry anthracnose in the United Statesuntil 1986 when Smith and Black (1986)reported the presence of C. acutatum onstrawberry in the United States. This fungushad previously been reported to causeanthracnose fruit rot of strawberry in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however,it had probably been present in the UnitedStates for some time under the name ofGloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides causes anthracnosecrown rot, petiole lesions, and leaf spotsindistinguishable from those caused byC. fragariae.

In a series of comparative studies of thesethree major causal agents of strawberryanthracnose, Smith and Black (1990) examined the cultural characteristics, conidia,appressoria, and setae of 24 Colletotrichumisolates. Colletotrichum fragariae isolatesdeveloped beige to olive to dark gray colonies, did not form the ascigerous state inculture, and their conidia were typicallycylindrical with one end sharply taperedand the other end rounded. Colletotrichumgloeosporioides isolates were very similarexcept they formed the Glomerella cingulataascigerous state in culture and their conidiausually were rounded on both ends. Isolatesof both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioidesproduced dark black setae, visible with ahand lens, in acervuli in culture and onpetiole, stolon, and fruit lesions. Colletotrichum acutatum isolates produced fusiformconidia tapered on both ends; developedwhite, pink, orange, rose, or beige colonies;and did not form setae or the ascigerous statein culture. The growth rate of C. acutatum inculture was slower than the other two speciesat all temperatures tested with the greatestdifference being at 32 �C.

Colletotrichum fragariae, the ‘‘original’’anthracnose fungus, was first identified inFlorida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spreadthroughout the southeastern United Statesand was responsible for crown rot and deathof many plants in strawberry nurseries in the1970s (Horn et al., 1972). It has a narrow hostrange, infecting only strawberry and a fewweed hosts, and is rarely found outside thesoutheastern United States. Colletotrichumfragariae generally causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum,and C. fragariae is considered by some tobe a host-specific or con-specific form ofC. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howardet al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).

In the late 1970s, C. gloeosporioides wasidentified as the causal agent on plantsobtained from Arkansas and North Carolinanurseries that died from a crown rot identicalto that caused by C. fragariae (Howard et al.,1992). It has a wide host and geographicrange, causing diseases of many plant hostsworldwide.

The greatest economic losses due toanthracnose on strawberry are from fruit rotcaused by C. acutatum, which also infectsmany other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernsteinet al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith,2002). The presence of the pathogen has beenreported on strawberries in almost all areasof the world where they are grown. Crowninfections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather thanMention of trade names or commercial products inthis article is solely for the purpose of providingspecific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture.1To whom correspondence should be addressed;e-mail Barbara.Smith@ars.usda.govHORTSCIENCE VOL. 43(1) FEBRUARY 2008 69plant death. Infected plants usually do notthrive after transplantation and produce fewberries at harvest.

Historically, C. acutatum has been considered to be the anthracnose fruit-rottingpathogen, and C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides have been associated with petiole andstolon lesions and crown rot; however, allthree species may cause similar symptomsand may be found to occur on the same plant(Howard et al., 1992). Identification of thesepathogens should be based on classical taxonomic characteristics or molecular techniques, not symptoms.

Results of several studies suggest thatC. acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specificto strawberries. In one of these studies(Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolatesof Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates ofC. acutatum (62 from strawberry) and 14isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 fromstrawberry), were characterized by variousmolecular methods and pathogenicity tests.

Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence dataprovided genetic evidence of two subgroupswithin C. acutatum. The first subgroup,characterized as CA-clonal, included onlyisolates from strawberry and exhibited identical RAPD patterns and nearly identicalITS2 sequence analyses. A larger geneticgroup, CA-variable, included isolates fromvarious hosts and exhibited variable RAPDpatterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analysis. On the bases of these molecular data,Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed thatthe CA-clonal subgroup contained closelyrelated, highly virulent C. acutatum isolatesthat may have developed host specializationto strawberry. Isolates of Colletotrichum spp.

have been disseminated worldwide, probablythrough international plant exchanges, astheir genetic polymorphism and geographicalorigins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothanet al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas,2005).ANTHRACNOSE DISEASESYMPTOMSAnthracnose crown rot (Smith, 1998a),caused by either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides, is first apparent by the wilting ofthe youngest leaves in the hottest part of theday. The young wilted leaves may appear torecover and become turgid in the evenings;however, most will wilt and die after a fewdays. Shortly after plants wilt, a red discoloration appears within the crown tissue, andthe causal pathogen may be isolated fromdiscolored tissue. After the plants have beendead for several days, the crown tissue willturn dark brown to black, and then Colletotrichum spp. is difficult to isolate. Colletotrichum acutatum also may cause crowndeath; however, typically a single side crownis infected rather than the entire crown, andinfected plants are stunted but do not die.

Each of the three Colletotrichum spp. maycause petiole and stolon lesions which aredark brown or black and sunken and oftengirdle the petiole or stolon. Pink masses ofconidia are usually visible near the center ofeach lesion. All three species also cause leafspots (Howard et al., 1992; Maas and Palm,1997; Smith, 1998c). Black leaf spot, typically caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides, is characterized by gray or lightblack spots, usually not necrotic, pepperedacross the top surface of the strawberry leaflets. C. acutatum more typically causes irregular leaf spot, the primary symptom of whichis the appearance of necrotic black lesionsat the tip of the leaflets. All three Colletotrichum spp. also cause flower blights andfruit rots (Smith, 1998b). Fully open flowersare much more susceptible than closed buds(Smith, 1993). Infected green fruit are oftenhard and brown and mummify rather thanripen. Anthracnose lesions on ripe fruit arefirm, slightly sunken and covered with pinkspore masses. Colletotrichum acutatum alsocauses root lesions.

ANTHRACNOSE INFECTIONPROCESS AND PATHOGENDISPERSALCurry et al. (2002) studied the infectionprocess of strawberry petioles and stolons byC. acutatum and C. fragariae using light andelectron microscopy. Both fungal speciesinvaded the host tissue in a similar manner;however, C. fragariae invaded the plantsmore rapidly than did C. acutatum. Bothspecies penetrated the cuticle via an appressorium, and their hyphae grew within thecuticle and cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. They beganinvasion with a brief biotrophic phase, inwhich they invaded living cells, before entering an extended necrotrophic phase, in whichthey proliferated among dead cells. Acervuliformed once the cortical tissue had beenmoderately disrupted and developed as astroma just beneath the outer periclinal epidermal walls. Acervuli erupted through thecuticle and released conidia. Invasion of thevascular tissue typically occurred after acervuli matured but remained minimal.

The time from infection of the strawberryby Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation(the latent period) is an important factor inthe speed at which anthracnose may spreadwithin a field. The latent period dependson the temperature and ranges from 2–3 d at25 �C to 6–17 d at 5 �C (King et al., 1997). At5 and 10 �C, the latent period was shorter forC. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides andC. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures the latent period for all species wassimilar. Appressoria and secondary conidiaproduced by C. acutatum on symptomlessfoliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al.,2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growingseason (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidialgermination, appressorial production, andsecondary conidiation are all favored bylonger periods of wetness than the 4 hrequired for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weekson leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandroet al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric(Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flowerextracts than when exposed to leaf extracts orwater (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting thatC. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberryfoliage may increase during flowering.

Rain splash is the primary means bywhich Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spreadfrom plant to plant in the field. Maddenand Boudreau (1997) found that anthracnosefruit rot incidence generally declined as plantdensity increased and concluded that plantdensity reduced the amount of rain thatpenetrated the plant canopy, thus reducingthe amount of splash. Most fruit infectionoccurred in a 25-cm radius of the source ofthe inoculum, an infected fruit (Madden andWilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999)studied splash dispersal of the conidia of thethree Colletotrichum spp. and found thatconidia of C. fragariae dispersed over theshortest distance and those of C. acutatumdispersed over the longest distance. This wasprobably due to the greater amount of sporesproduced on infected fruit by C. acutatum.

Colletotrichum acutatum conidia may survive in soil and plant debris under dryconditions for up to 12 months, but conidiaand sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, i.e., soil moisture $12% (Normanand Strandberg, 1997).

ANTHRACNOSE CULTURALCONTROL MEASURESBecause the primary source of infection inmost fruiting fields appeared to be infectedtransplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after theanthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980sto obtain their transplants from nurseries inthe northern United States, Canada, or California that were believed to be outside therange of C. fragariae. More recently, C.acutatum has been found in some of thenurseries in these areas. McInnes et al.

(1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-freetransplants can be produced in the southeastern United States by locating nurseries inareas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants remainthe primary control of anthracnose crownrot and fruit rot.

Because Colletotrichum spp. may infectmany other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields sometimes is assumed to comefrom these other hosts growing near thestrawberry field. To test the hypothesis thatColletotrichum spp. may move from otherfruit or vegetable hosts to strawberry, 37Colletotrichum isolates, representing ninespecies collected from 12 hosts, werewound-inoculated onto the leaves and stemsof strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith,2002). Colletotrichum fragariae isolates70 HORTSCIENCE VOL. 43(1) FEBRUARY 2008were the most aggressive and caused lesionsat an average of 38% of inoculation sites onall hosts except pepper. Percentages of infection for the other species were 25% Colletotrichum capsici, 18% C. gloeosporioides, 15%C. acutatum, 11% C. destructivum, 9% C.truncatum, 8% C. coccodes, 6% C. higginsianun, and 5% C. orbiculare. Strawberry wasthe most susceptible host with 58% of petioleand 14% of leaf inoculations of all isolatesresulting in lesion development. Pepper wasthe most resistant host with no symptomdevelopment on leaves or stems followinginoculation with any isolate. These resultssuggest that primary anthracnose infectionsin strawberry fields are most often frominfected strawberry transplants and only rarelyfrom other diseased fruit or vegetable hosts.

Anthracnose spreads within a field bysplashing water, and living mulches (suchas wheat, rye, or rye grass) in row middleshave been shown to reduce disease spreadwithin a field. Sublethal doses of grassspecific herbicides such as sethoxydim, maybe used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, suchas wheat straw or pine needles, will alsoreduce splash and result in lower incidenceof anthracnose compared with rows mulchedwith plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith andSpiers, 1986). Anthracnose is less severewhen water is supplied to plants using dripirrigation rather than overhead irrigation(Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986).

Anthracnose crown rot was observed to beless severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown on soils with low nitrogenfertility (Howard, et al., 1992). In greenhousestudies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined thatstrawberries grown in soils with high levelsof nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose thanplants grown in soils with lower nitrogenlevels or those with high levels of calciumnitrate. Anthracnose fruit rot caused byC. acutatum was less severe on fruit fromgreenhouse-grown plants receiving drench orfoliar applications of calcium sulfate than onfruit from plants receiving water, calciumchloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruitfrom plants receiving foliar applications ofCaCl2 developed less fruit rot than that fromplants receiving soil applications of CaCl2(Smith and Gupton, 1993).

The primary means to reduce the buildupof anthracnose fruit rot in the field is toharvest fruit frequently and remove all rottenfruit from the field. Following severe infections early in the fruiting season, all infectedfruit should be stripped from the plants andremoved from the field. Infected areas of afield should be harvested last in the day, orworkers should wash up and change to cleanclothes when they must enter un-infectedareas of the field after they have harvestedareas where fruit rot is present.

IN-VITRO FUNGICIDE STUDIESUntil highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce lossesdue to anthracnose. Failure of fungicidesto control anthracnose epidemics may bedue to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population.

For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnosecrown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971)and was used intensively by strawberrygrowers for years to control anthracnoseand other diseases. However, the anthracnosepathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae,developed resistance to it and other bendimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995;McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black,1992, 1993), and benomyl was no longereffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields. In-vitro trials have been used toscreen fungicides for their ability to controlanthracnose (LaMondia, 1993; McInneset al., 1992b; Smith and Black, 1992). Smithand Black (1993) reported that all 16 C.acutatum, 14 out of 18 C. fragariae, and bothC. gloeosporioides isolates they tested invitro were resistant to benomyl and that allbenomyl-resistant isolates were also resistantto carbendazim, which is in the same class offungicides as benomyl. In a greenhousestudy, plants treated with propiconazole hadlower disease severity ratings than did plantstreated with captafol or benomyl (Smith andBlack, 1991). However, the propiconazoletreated plants were shorter with dark greenleaves that appeared thicker than the leaves ofuntreated plants.

FIELD FUNGICIDE TRIALSSixteen different fungicide treatmentswere evaluated in five fungicide studiesconducted at Hammond, LA, and Poplarville,MS, during the 2002, 2003, and 2005 fruitingseasons (Wedge et al., 2007). Treatmentswere applied at 7- to 10-d intervals to threestrawberry cultivars. The most frequent fruitrots at harvest were anthracnose fruit rot(caused by Colletotrichum spp.), stem endrot (caused by Gnomonia comari P. Karst),and Botrytis gray mold (caused by Botrytiscinerea Pers.:Fr.). Compared with theuntreated control treatment, less anthracnosefruit rot occurred on berries from the pyraclostrobin + boscalid, cyprodinil + fludioxonil, azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, captan +fenhexamid, and captan treatments.

USDA-ARS ANTHRACNOSEBREEDING PROGRAMIn the early 1980s, when anthracnosebecame a major disease of strawberries inthe southeastern United States, a breedingprogram to develop anthracnose-resistantcultivars adapted to the strawberry-growingareas in the southeastern United States wasinstituted by the USDA-ARS at the SmallFruit Research Station, Poplarville, MS, andthe Fruit Laboratory, Beltsville, MD, with thecollaboration of state experiment stationsin Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina(Galletta et al., 1997; Smith and Spiers,1982). From 1976 to 1995, over 160,000progeny from 448 crosses made at Beltsville,MD, primarily by G.J. Galletta, were screenedfor anthracnose resistance in the greenhouseat Poplarville, MS. Initially, parent lines wereeastern cultivars and advanced selectionsfrom the breeding program at Beltsville. Asthe program progressed, resistant selectionsfrom the anthracnose program were crossedwith commercial cultivars to improve thehorticultural characteristics of the progeny.

Seed from the crosses made at Beltsville weregerminated at Poplarville, and resultant seedlings were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. fragariae, incubated in a dewchamber for 48 h, moved to a warm greenhouse, and rated for anthracnose severity 30d after inoculation. Resistant seedlings wereevaluated in the field in Florida, Louisiana,Mississippi, Maryland, and North Carolina;selections were made on the bases of yield,fruit quality, plant habit, and resistance to leafscorch [caused by Diplocarpon earlianum(Ellis & Everh.) F.A. Wolf], leaf spot [causedby Mycosphaerella fragariae (Tul.) Lindau],powdery mildew [caused by Sphaerothecamacularis (Wallr.:Fr.) Jacz f. sp. fragariaePeries], and two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae Koch).Fifteen hundred fifteen (1515) anthracnose-resistant selections were made from theseedlings field-tested in Mississippi. Four ofthese anthracnose-resistant strawberry cloneswere released as breeding lines (Gallettaet al., 1993) and have been used as the sourceof anthracnose resistance in several breedingprograms. Smith et al. (1998) released thecultivar Pelican, which is highly resistantto both anthracnose crown rot caused byC. fragariae and anthracnose fruit rot causedby C. acutatum. ‘Pelican’ is also resistant tofive races of red stele caused by Phytophthorafragariae. Evaluation of strawberry seedlingsand advanced breeding lines from state andprivate breeding programs is an ongoingproject. The USDA anthracnose-resistancescreening procedure has effectively identifiedresistant genotypes in seedling progeniesfrom the North Carolina State Universitybreeding program, with >32,000 resistantstrawberry seedlings identified between1998 and 1999 (Ballington et al., 2002).

Smith and Black (1987) found that resistance to C. fragariae was influenced byenvironmental conditions after inoculationand that plants incubated at a high temperature (35 �C) for 48 h in a dew chamber(relative humidity near 100%) had higherdisease severity ratings when compared withplants incubated at 25 or 30 �C. Plantsmaintained in a greenhouse at 32 �C afterdew chamber incubation developed moresevere symptoms than did those held in agreenhouse at 25 �C. Two- to 4-week-oldstrawberry seedlings (age after transplantingat the first true-leaf stage) were more susceptible to C. fragariae than 14- to 18-weekold seedlings when spray inoculated with aconidial suspension (Smith et al., 1990).

Tissue culture-induced (somaclonal) variation is another strategy being pursuedHORTSCIENCE VOL. 43(1) FEBRUARY 2008 71for generating disease-resistant genotypes.

Hammerschlag et al. (2006) screened shootsregenerated from leaf explants of six commercially important cultivars for resistance toa virulent isolate of C. acutatum. Somacloneswith higher levels of anthracnose resistancewere identified for all the cultivars, and thegreatest increases in disease resistance wereobserved for somaclones of Chandler, Pelican, and Sweet Charlie, where resistanceincreased 12-fold. These studies provideevidence that in-vitro screening can be usedto evaluate strawberry germplasm for anthracnose resistance and that somaclonal variation is influenced by strawberry genotype.

INHERITANCE OF RESISTANCE TOANTHRACNOSEGupton and Smith (1991) determined thatthe estimates of dominance genetic variancewere six to 10 times higher than those foradditive genetic variance. The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was bimodal suggesting major gene action. Narrowsense heritability estimates of 0.37 and 0.26were probably sufficient to produce gainsfrom recurrent selection, while gains fromselection of clonal value should be possiblebecause of the high (0.87 and 0.85) broadsense heritability estimates. Giménez andBallington (2002) also found that nonadditiveeffects were more important than additiveeffects in the inheritance of resistance onrunners. The epistatic nature of anthracnoseresistance on runners appears to be supportedby results of crosses between susceptibleparents that result in up to 20% resistantseedlings (Ballington et al., 2002). Giménezand Ballington (2002) found that the frequency distribution of lesion lengths withinprogenies suggests that resistance to C. acutatum on runners is quantitative. Results ofGarcés et al. (2002) also support the theorythat inheritance of resistance to anthracnose isquantitative in nature.

Increased losses due to anthracnose fruitand crown rots may be related to the shiftfrom matted-row culture to the annual plasticulture production system in the UnitedStates. Breeding for genetic resistance toanthracnose and development of resistantcultivars are primary means for reducingeconomic loses due to this disease. This isenvironmentally sound because it results inreduced use of fungicides.

CONCLUSIONSAs our knowledge of the anthracnosepathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our abilityto control these diseases. Changes in culturalpractices have resulted in reduced levels ofdisease. At the same time, development ofmore effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have greatlyreduced losses due to both anthracnose crownrot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars also have reduced economic losses dueto these diseases. Even so, growers maysustain severe losses when environmentalfactors are highly favorable for anthracnosedevelopment.

Box 287, Poplarville, MS 39470. Accepted for publication 23 May 2002. ABSTRACT Curry, K. J., Abril, M., Avant, J. B., and Smith, B. J. 2002. Strawberry anthracnose: Histopathology of Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae. Phytopathology 92:1055-1063.  Ontogeny of the invasion process by Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae was studied on petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler using light and electron microscopy. The invasion of host tissue by each fungal species was similar; however, each invasion event occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum. Following cuticular penetration via an appressorium, subsequent steps of invasion involved hyphal growth within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. Both species of fungi began invasion with a brief biotrophic phase before entering an extended necrotrophic phase. Acervuli formed once the cortical tissue had been moderately disrupted and began with the development of a stroma just beneath the outer periclinal epidermal walls. Acervuli erupted through the cuticle and released conidia. Invasion of the vascular tissue typically occurred after acervulus maturation and remained minimal. Chitin distribution in walls of C. fragariae was visualized with gold-labeled wheat germ agglutinin. The outer layer of bilayered walls of conidia, germ tubes, and appressoria contained less chitin than unilayered hyphae in planta.

Anthracnose diseases of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) are caused by the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk) (8,21–23,26). All three species incite diseases, which cannot be distinguished in the field by symptoms alone. Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown worldwide, but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they cause little injury to the plants. C. fragariae is most often associated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, humid areas such as the southeastern United States. Its host range is limited to strawberries and a few weeds (22). C. acutatum is the primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot, has a broader geographic and host range than C. fragariae (8,10,22), and is increasing in importance as a cause of petiole, stolon, crown, and root infections (7). A large number of light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published, but we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum– and C. fragariae–strawberry systems. A consideration of the detailed natures of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is necessary in understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is the condition in which the fungus maintains its host cells alive while removing nutrients from them (9,16). Necrotrophy is the condition in which the fungus approaches living host cells and kills them before entering their lumina (9,12,16,28). Hemibiotrophy is a condition in which the fungus initially enters a biotrophic phase and then switches to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the absence of a significant plant resistant response ensure successful colonization of host tissue and subsequent necrotrophic activities. Bailey et al. (1) described two major invasion strategies, intracellular hemibiotrophic invasion and subcuticular intramural invasion. Early stages of invasion for both strategies include conidial adhesion to the host surface, germination of conidia, production of germ tubes, and penetration of the host cuticle via appressoria. Subcuticular intramural pathogens grow within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells killing host cells prior to entering them (necrotrophic phase). Intracellular hemibiotrophic pathogens invade living cells for a short time, maintaining them apparently for nutritional advantage, and then convert to a necrotrophic phase. The role of chitin both as a host defense elicitor and as a target for plant chitinases is well documented (3,18,20). Several fungi are known to modify or mask chitin in structures involved in early penetration presumably to avoid detection by the host or to avoid the effects of host chitinases. A lectin probe, gold-labeled wheat germ agglutinin, was chosen to study the distribution of chitin in the walls of C. fragariae during the initial infection of the strawberry host. The purpose of this study was to document the invasion strategies of C. acutatum and C. fragariae in strawberry with respect to strategies previously described by Bailey et al. (1), and to examine the degree to which chitin was present in various fungal infective structures. MATERIALS AND METHODS Propagation of strawberry plants. Strawberry plants (cv. Chandler) were planted in 10- × 10-cm plastic pots containing a 1:1 (vol/vol) mixture of Jiffy-Mix (JPA, West Chicago, IL) and pasteurized sand and grown for at least 6 weeks before inoculation in a greenhouse maintained at 30°C day/18°C night �6°C with a 16-h photoperiod. Older leaves, runners, and flowers were removed 1 to 7 days before inoculation, and three or four young leaves remained on each plant at inoculation. Corresponding author: B. J.

Isolates of C. acutatum Goff and C. fragariae CF-63 and CF-75 (26) were maintained on silica gel at USDA-ARS in Poplarville, MS. These isolates were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 14 to 21 days at 25°C under fluorescent light at 14/10 h of light/dark intervals. The cultures were located approximately 18 cm beneath four fluorescent tubes (Sylvania Super Saver Lite White, 34 W, 16.7 µmol�m2�s–1; OSRAM Sylvania, Danvers, MA). Conidial suspensions used for inoculations were prepared by flooding each PDA culture plate with sterile deionized water and gently scraping the agar surface with a glass rod to remove conidia. The resulting conidial suspension was filtered through cheesecloth and a final conidial suspension of 1.5 × 106 conidia per ml was used to inoculate strawberry plants. Attached petioles and stolons were inoculated by misting to the point of runoff or by spot inoculation. Plants were incubated in a TABLE 1.

Vol. 92, No. 10, 2002 1057 sealed 10-gallon tank at 100% relative humidity for 24 h and then at reduced relative humidity by removing half of the plastic tank cover for the remainder of the incubation time (25,26). Plants inoculated with C. acutatum were incubated at 28°C; those inoculated with C. fragariae were incubated at 32°C. Following inoculation, petioles and stolons were examined microscopically at  8- to 10-h intervals for 96 h to document the morphology and time required for germ tube development, appressorial formation, penetration of the epidermis, subsequent invasion of tissue, development of disease symptoms, and acervulus production. Tissue processing. Symptomatic tissue was fixed for 2 h in  0.1 M sodium cacodylate buffer (pH 7.0), 2.0% formaldehyde, and 2.5% glutaraldehyde. Tissue was rinsed with distilled water and postfixed 45 min in cacodylate buffered (pH 7.0) 1% osmium tetroxide. Tissue was dehydrated with an ethanol series (50, 70, 85, 95, and 100%) followed by propylene oxide. Tissue was  then infiltrated in 50/50% by volume ERL 4206 resin (Spurr’s)/ propylene oxide for 4 h on a rotator, followed by 75/25%  by volume resin/propylene oxide change overnight on a rotator. Tissue was infiltrated with two changes of 100% resin during  an 8-h period and cured at 70°C for 24 to 36 h. ERL 4206  resin contained nonenyl succinic anhydride (26 g), vinyl cyclohexene dioxide (10 g), diglycidyl ether (6 g), and dimethylaminoethanol (0.2 g). Slides with semithin sections (�1 µm) were placed on a hotplate at 55°C, stained for 1 to 2 min with 0.1% aqueous toluidine blueO, and examined with a light microscope. Ultrathin sections  (�100 nm) were taken with a Porter-Blum MT-2B microtome (Ivan Sorvall, Inc., Newton, CT) and a diamond knife (Diatome-U.S., Fort Washington, PA) and collected on 200-mesh copper grids. Grids were stained with lead citrate (19) and 2% aqueous uranyl acetate. Sections were viewed using a Zeiss EM 10-C transmission electron microscope (Carl Zeiss, Inc., Thornwood, NY). We developed a procedure to aid in the location of appressoria on fixed, embedded material. Slivers of epidermal tissue on which appressoria had been seen with a compound microscope were flat embedded in 2 to 3 mm of resin and cured at 70°C for 20 to 24 h. Appressoria on the host tissue were identified through the thin plastic with a compound microscope, and hand sections containing appressoria were obtained. Those hand sections were then remounted with Duco cement (Devcon, Danvers, MA) on prefaced stubs (created by curing Spurr’s plastic in polyethylene Beem  Fig. 2.

The application of the wheat germ agglutinin probe (WGA; L-9640, Sigma, St. Louis) was modified from Benhamou (2). The ultrathin sections on 200-mesh nickel grids were floated on a drop of 0.01 M phosphate buffered saline (PBS; 40 ml of 0.02 M potassium hydroxide, 50 ml of 0.02 M potassium dihydrogen phosphate, and 10 ml of distilled water), pH 7.4, in a moist chamber for 1 h. Grids were subsequently incubated for 2 h in a moist chamber in 15 µl of lectin-gold complex at the concentration supplied by the manufacturer of 1.4 × 1013 particles per ml. The probe was lectin from Triticum vulgaris conjugated to  10 nm colloidal gold particles. Each grid was then washed by dipping repeatedly and gently for 10 s into PBS. Grids were air dried and then stained with lead citrate and uranyl acetate as described above. Controls. Four-day-old cultures of C. fragariae grown on PDA as described above were overlaid by a thin layer of 2% agar to hold the mycelium together. Pieces of the culture were cut into plugs 3 × 3 mm, fixed and processed for ultrathin sectioning, and probed with gold-labeled lectin as previously described. The specificity of the WGA lectin binding was determined by the following tests used by Benhamou (2). These controls were run simultaneously with the application of the normal probe on symptomatic tissue. (1) The gold-labeled lectin was first preadsorbed with poly-(1-4)-�-N-acetyl-D-glucosamine purified from crab shells (C-9752, Sigma, St. Louis) at a concentration of 1 mg per 2 ml of probe for 1 h and then applied as described above to sections containing fungi from a strawberry petiole lesion 1 mm or larger. (2) The ultrathin sections were floated on a drop of PBS for 1 h and probed with wheat germ agglutinin without a gold label for 1 h. The remainder of the probe application was as described above. RESULTS Light microscopy. The ontogeny of the infection processes  of C. acutatum and C. fragariae on inoculated plants were  similar (Table 1) at the light or electron microscopic levels. Lesions most commonly developed on stolon tips and the upper portion of the youngest petiole with fully expanded leaflets. Lesions were first observed 2 days after inoculation as lenticular  brown spots that developed into the dark, sunken, and leathery  Fig. 5.

Spore germination began as early as 16 h after inoculation, with the germ tubes originating from either end of a conidium and occasionally from both ends. Germ tubes generally spanned one plant cell length or less, but occasionally grew across several cells. Appressorial formation began as early as 20 h after inoculation. Development of an appressorium began as a swelling of the germ tube tip. Appressorial development could occur on such a short germ tube as to appear sessile. Appressoria were initially unmelanized, but by 24 h they were fully pigmented (Fig. 1A). Small circular areas on the basal sides of appressoria, seen by focusing through an appressorium with the light microscope, were interpreted to be pores from which the penetration pegs developed (Fig. 1A). The typical mature appressorium for either species was globose and approximately 3 to 5 µm in diameter. Appressoria frequently developed over anticlinal host walls, but occasionally, were found over periclinal walls or near stomata. Appressoria and their basal pores were found on the surface of both healthy and diseased plant tissue. The first signs of host cell distress appeared when the cell wall contour became distorted, and the plasmalemma pulled away from the cell wall (Fig. 1B to D). Hyphae during early stages of lesion formation were less abundant in epidermal and subepidermal cells than in cortical cells. A gradual increase of fungal hyphae in the host cuticle, epidermis, and subepidermis was observed with hyphae restricted to the apoplast in early stages of invasion and then invading dead cells (Fig. 1B to D). As the infection progressed, cell walls became increasingly distorted (Fig. 1D). In contrast to disrupted cortical cell walls, epidermal and subepidermal walls remained intact even though hyphae penetrated their walls (Fig. 2A).

Bar = 2 µm.  Vol. 92, No. 10, 2002 1061 formation occurred concurrently (Fig. 2A and B). The fungus was seen in vessel elements (Fig. 2B) during this last phase of the invasion process. Acervulus formation began with the development of a stroma within the cuticle of epidermal cells. The cuticle expanded considerably to accommodate the growing acervulus (Fig. 2C). The maturing acervulus broke through the cuticle and eventually produced conidia (Fig. 2D). The acervulus expanded radially with the stroma also extending from the epidermis to the subepidermis. Acervuli were produced over a disrupted cortex, or in extreme cases, over a completely disintegrated cortex (Fig. 2D). In either case, the epidermal and some of the subepidermal tissue remained intact. The invasion of host tissue by C. fragariae and C. acutatum was similar. However, each invasion event occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum (Table 1). Lesions were visible on petioles 3 days after inoculation with C. fragariae, but were not visible until 4 days after inoculation with C. acutatum. A similar delay in invasion events was observed between petiole and stolen tissues following inoculation of either species. Most events were observed a day sooner on the stolons than on the petioles within species. Electron microscopy. The conidial and germ tube walls comprised two layers, with the outer layer being thinner and more electron dense than the inner layer. Only the inner conidial layer was labeled by the WGA probe (Fig. 3). Upon germination, a septum was laid down bisecting the conidium (Fig. 3), and one also developed between the conidium and the germ tube. The WGA probe was observed on the inner wall layers of the germ tube and its septa. A few vesicles were present in the germ tube after maturation of the appressorium, although no distinct organelles were seen. The probe was not found in the cytoplasm of germ tubes or appressoria. Appressoria were sometimes covered by an extracellular matrix that was somewhat amorphous with dispersed fibrillar material. The appressorial matrix was not labeled by the WGA probe (Fig. 4). The upper wall of the appressorium appeared to have two distinct layers, with the probe being restricted to the inner layer (Fig. 4). The two layers became gradually indistinct as they approached the basal side of the appressorium. The appressorial pore was defined by the appressorial wall tapering toward a central area on the basal side. The pore was usually occluded by a membrane (Fig. 4). No evidence of labeling was found on either the host cytoplasm or walls (Fig. 4). Some hyphae invaded the cuticle (Fig. 5A), outer epidermal wall, and anticlinal walls of the epidermis (Fig. 5B). Some hyphae initially penetrated what appeared to be living host cells (Fig. 5C and D). The host plasmalemma invaginated to accommodate hyphal penetration. The interface of the host membrane and hyphal wall was frequently associated with a particular arrangement of electron dense material (Fig. 5C and D). Several degrees of disturbance and relaxation of the microfibrillar components of cell walls were observed during penetration of host cells including early penetration events (Fig. 5A). Death of fungal cells was a rare occurrence. Several dying host cells exhibited an amorphous, osmiophilic material around the inside portion of the tonoplast (Fig. 6A, C, and D); others did not (Fig. 6B). Some cortical fungal hyphae appeared to be growing back to the epidermis in the stage prior to acervulus formation (Fig. 6C). Acervulus formation involved the development of a subcuticular stroma within and beneath the outer host epidermal cell walls (Fig. 6D). A gradual vacuolation de Fig. 7.

Bar = 5 µm.  1062 PHYTOPATHOLOGY veloped in stromatic cells (Fig. 6D). The stroma continued to develop into the epidermal and adjacent subepidermal cells, finally rupturing the cuticle (Fig. 7). Late development of the acervulus included the extension of the host cuticle to accommodate the expanding stroma, the rupture of the cuticle, and early development of conidia (Fig. 7). C. acutatum and C. fragariae had a pulvinate type of acervulus (27). Controls. There were no apparent variations in the labeling of walls of fungi grown on PDA when compared to both young and older hyphae from lesions in planta. The WGA probe was evenly distributed on the unilayered walls. Septa were labeled with the same intensity as the outer walls. Labeling was diminished as expected when the probe was preadsorbed with chitin (control 1). Labeling was diminished as expected when the sections were incubated with lectin before applying the lectin-gold complex (control 2). DISCUSSION C. acutatum and C. fragariae underwent a very brief biotrophic phase (less than 12 h) before entering their extended necrotrophic phase. Representatives of both species of fungi were observed entering living host cells and developing a matrix comparable to that described in reported biotrophic systems (4,11,13,15), but they killed the host cells within a few hours. Previous descriptions for other Colletotrichum species cite biotrophy at a minimum of “less than 24 h” (14,29). But a situation in which a living cell is entered and quickly killed might be considered a modification of necrotrophy, rather than biotrophy or hemibiotrophy. Both intracellular hemibiotrophic and subcuticular intramural Colletotrichum species avoid triggering resistance responses during the symptomless phase (17). Species with an intracellular hemibiotrophic strategy require an intimate cytoplasmic interaction between the plant and the pathogen, while species with a subcuticular intramural strategy do not require such intimacy. Since the former species have a restricted host range, they are considered specialists, while the latter species are considered generalists (1). Regardless of the length of the biotrophic phase, all species eventually revert to necrotrophic development. Since C. acutatum is a generalist invader, only necrotrophic development was predicted, while C. fragariae is a specialist invader (22) for which an extended biotrophic phase was predicted to precede the necrotrophic phase. The brevity of the biotrophic phase in C. acutatum and C. fragariae leaves some uncertainty about calling these fungi hemibiotrophs and comparing their initial infection strategies in terms of previously described species. Penetration pegs were observed in our studies at the light microscope level but not the ultrastructural level. Appressoria of C. fragariae observed at the ultrastructural level may have been in the process of forming a penetration peg or may have been arrested just prior to formation of a penetration peg. Latent or quiescent stages have been observed in fungal infections of fruits (30) where the mature appressorium often will not produce a peg until the fruit is at a particular stage of ripeness. This concept has not been sufficiently studied in strawberry for the fungal penetration of stolon, petioles, leaves, or roots. Strawberry petioles are often more resistant to infection by C. fragariae while the plant is in fruit (5,8). Development of appressoria of some species ceases under the onset of unfavorable conditions, remains latent, and resumes when the conditions are again favorable (6). The more rapid invasion of host tissue by C. fragariae than by C. acutatum is in agreement with previous reports that C. fragariae is more aggressive than C. acutatum in inciting disease symptoms following inoculation (24,26). The distribution of chitin visualized by WGA gold probe in C. lindemuthianum has been reported by O’Connell and Ride (15). We found several similarities as well as some differences between their findings and our results using the same probe to study C. fragariae. The outer appressorial wall layer of C. lindemuthianum was labeled more heavily by the probe than the inner layer. By contrast, the outer appressorial wall layer of C. fragariae was labeled less heavily by the probe than the inner layer. The matrices of both C. lindemuthianum and C. fragariae were unlabeled. The young intracellular hyphae of C. lindemuthianum were unlabeled, but the invasive hyphal walls of C. fragariae and walls of the comparable secondary hyphae of C. lindemuthianum were labeled. The actively growing hyphal tips of either species labeled with less intensity than the mature walls. The outer wall layers of preinvasive structures of C. fragariae did not show chitin-gold complex, but the single wall layers of invasive hyphae from the earliest stages observed in planta contain chitin distribution comparable to young hyphae observed in vitro. C. fragariae did not appear to modify its chitin distribution during its very brief biotrophic phase as does C. lindemuthianum. This supports O’Connell and Ride’s (15) suggestion that chitin masking is necessary during initial contact to establish a biotrophic relationship.

Through a systematic literature review, weretrieved the published information on Colletotrichum anthracnose diseases ondifferent host plants and developed a mechanistic model incorporating the mainstages of the pathogen’s life cycle and the effect of weather. The model predictsanthracnose progress during the growing season on the aerial organs of differentcrops, and was parameterized for seven Colletotrichum clades (acutatum,dematium, destructivum, gloeosporioides, graminicola, and orbiculare) and thesingleton species, C. coccodes. The model was evaluated for the anthracnosediseases caused by fungi belonging to five clades on six hosts by using data from17 epidemics that occurred in Italy, the USA, Canada, and Japan. A comparison ofobserved versus predicted data showed a concordance correlation coefficient of0.928 and an average distance between real data and the fitted line of 0.044.

After further validation, the model could be used to support decision-making forcrop protection.

KEYWORDSepidemiology, disease modeling, glomerella, systematic literature review,model validation1 IntroductionFungi in the genus Colletotrichum (phylum: Ascomycota, class: Sordariomycetes) causepre- and post-harvest diseases in horticultural, ornamental, and fruit tree crops worldwide(Hyde et al., 2009; Cannon et al., 2012). The genus Colletotrichum was ranked among thetop 10 fungal plant pathogens with scientific and economic importance (Dean et al., 2012).

This genus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions as well as in temperateand Mediterranean areas. Common hosts range from high-value crops like strawberry,olive, apple, and grape, to staple food crops grown by subsistence farmers in developingcountries like sorghum and cassava (Pastor-Corrales and Frederiksen, 1978; Peres et al.,2005; Sangpueak et al., 2018). Many Colletotrichum species are primarily reported as causalagents of anthracnose, which is also known by other names, like bitter rot on apple and ripefrontiersin.org01https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-sciencehttps://www.frontiersin.orghttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2023-03-29mailto:vittorio.rossi@unicatt.ithttps://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#editorial-boardhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#editorial-boardhttps://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-scienceSalotti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092rot on grape (Dowling et al., 2020). In addition to causing severeyield losses, anthracnose epidemics can reduce the quality of theproduce (Waller et al., 2002; Dowling et al., 2020). Blossom blightand fruit rots are often the main economically damaging symptoms;however, necrotic lesions can also appear on leaves, stems, andtwigs, leading to the deterioration of plants and a reduction in fruitquality (Dowling et al., 2020).

Colletotrichum species are grouped into phylogenetic clades(also called “species complexes”) on the basis of multilocusmolecular analysis. Species within a clade are closely related toeach other (Cannon et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2020; Talhinhas andBaroncelli, 2021) and have similar temperature requirements(Salotti et al., 2022). A recent systematic review of the taxonomyand of the phylogenetic clades of the genus identified 15 majorclades and a number of small clusters and isolated species(Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). Detailed descriptions of majorphylogenetic clades and the list of species in each clade wereprovided by Cannon et al. (2012); Vieira et al. (2020); Talhinhasand Baroncelli (2021), Damm et al (2009; 2012; 2013; 2014), andWeir et al. (2012).

Colletotrichum species are primarily reported as causal agents ofanthracnose, occurring on plant leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits.

The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts have similarcomponents (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they aregenerally polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia)responsible for the initiation and spread of the epidemics. OtherColletotrichum diseases have been described, causing crown rot ofstrawberry and black dot on tomato and potato roots (Dillard andCobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002).

Colletotrichum species can also cause post-harvest diseases,especially on avocado, almond, and citrus fruit (Prusky, 1996;Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013); in these cases, thepathogens develop infection structures (appressoria) on the host,but remain dormant inside the fruit until after harvest (i.e., duringstorage, transportation, or sale of fruit), at which time symptomsdevelop (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Severalstudies reported that species within a clade show similarcolonization and infection behaviour, while the establishment ofquiescence is host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003;Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013;Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Species within cladesalso have similar temperature requirements for mycelial growth,conidial germination and infection, and spore production (Salottiet al., 2022). For example, C. gloeosporioides, C. fragarie, C. gossypii,and C. musae belonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimumtemperature for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germinationand infection between 25 and 32°C (Salotti et al., 2022).

Integrated pest management (IPM) against Colletotrichum spp.

includes cultural, biological, and chemical control. Cultural controlincludes producing disease-free propagating materials, avoiding theuse of overhead irrigation, limiting rain splashing by mulching, andmanaging weeds (Coelho et al., 2008; Saxena et al., 2016). Theremoval of infected crop residues and mummified or rotten fruits isrecommended to reduce the inoculum sources and the diseaseFrontiers in Plant Science 02pressure in the field (Samuelian et al., 2012; Saxena et al., 2016).

For instance, the removal of crop debris removal reduced by about30% the anthracnose severity in Ethiopian sorghum fields (Aragawet al., 2021). The use of resistant cultivars could be anenvironmentally friendly and cost-effective way to control thedisease (Saxena et al., 2016); however, available marketablecultivars often do not provide enough resistance to eliminate theneed for fungicides (Dowling et al., 2020). Biological control agents(BCAs), such as Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilus, have beenconsidered (Saxena et al., 2016; Dowling et al., 2020), but mostfarmers still prefer combining cultural practices and chemicalcontrol methods because of the variable efficacy of BCAs underfield conditions (Dowling et al., 2020). Calendar-basedapplication of chemicals, therefore, remains the main tool forcontrolling anthracnose diseases. This leads to intensive fungicidesprays, which may involve needless applications that are noteconomically or ecologically sustainable (Rossi et al., 2012).

Mathematical models can help growers schedule fungicidesprays (Pertot et al., 2017; Rossi et al., 2019; Fedele et al., 2022).

Models have been developed to understand the epidemiology ofanthracnose on specific crops and to support infection-risk-basedfungicide applications (Dodd et al., 1991; Park et al., 1992; Monroeet al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh, 2020). Most of these models,however, are simple and consider only one component of thepathogen life cycle, mainly conidial infection, and only focus on asingle Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of thesemodels have never been validated against independent data (i.e.,data not used in model development). Contrary to these simplemodels, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, a highexplanatory ability, and the possibility of making predictions overa wide range of agricultural contexts; as a result, mechanistic modelsare considered useful for decision-making in IPM (De Wolf andIsard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al. (2021) developedand validated a mechanistic, weather-driven model for the ripe rotof grapes caused by the Colletotrichum species.

Given that the pathogens causing different Colletotrichumdiseases affecting the aerial parts of host plants in the field (preharvest) have similar life cycles, we developed a general, weatherdriven, mechanistic model for anthracnose epidemics. The model is“general” in that it has one conceptual structure that incorporatesthe key epidemiological components and a set of equations thataccount for the effect of external variables (both environmental andhost-related), which can be calibrated for single Colletotrichumspecies, clades, and host plants. For model development andcalibration, we (i) conducted a systematic literature search toretrieve the available information on Colletotrichum anthracnosediseases; (ii) used this information to develop a conceptual model ofthe diseases caused by Colletotrichum species based on systemsanalysis; (iii) developed the mathematical equations describing thesystem both quantitatively and dynamically; (iv) calibrated themodel for seven major clades and the singleton species C.coccodes (which is referred to as the coccodes clade in thisreport); and finally (v) evaluated the ability of the model torepresent the real system.

Articles were searched by combining the following keywords:(i) Colletotrichum; (ii) conidia OR spore OR acervuli OR primaryinoculum OR production OR development OR overwinterOR dissemination OR release OR dispersion OR depositionOR infection OR penetration OR germination OR incubation ORlesion development OR lesion onset OR latency OR latent period, and(iii) temperature OR wetness OR relative humidity OR rain ORenvironment. Search strings are shown in Table 1 of theSupplementary material. The literature search was carried out in2022 in three bibliographical databases: Scopus (https://www.scopus.com/ accessed on February 25), Web of Science(https://www.webofscience.com/ accessed on February 28), andCAB Abstracts (https://www.cabdirect.org/cabdirect/search/accessed on March 1). Each article found was first reviewed on thebasis of the information in the title and abstract; articles of potentialinterest were then read in full. Additional articles were retrieved fromthe “References” section of the found articles; these articles werealso reviewed.

Selected papers were used to extract information on theinfluence of environmental conditions on the consideredbiological processes. Data on the pathogen or the disease wereobtained directly from the text, tables, or graphs in the papers; theGetData Graph Digitizer 2.24 (http://getdata-graph-digitizer.comaccessed on 5 May 2021) was used to obtain precise datafrom graphs.

2.2 Conceptualization of the systemAlthough different life styles have been described forColletotrichum spp. (i.e., necrotrophic, biotrophic, hemibiotrophic,quiescent, and endophytic life styles), the life cycles of these specieshave some common attributes (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al.,2017), which include both sexual and asexual reproduction. Becausethe perithecial stage is rarely observed in the field (Dowling et al.,2020), the asexual conidia are the most important stage for diseasedevelopment; our model, therefore, focuses on the asexual life cycle. Ageneral, asexual life cycle for Colletotrichum spp. is shown in Figure 1.

Colletotrichum spp. overwinter as mycelium or sclerotia in cropdebris (Farley, 1976; Casela and Frederiksen, 1993; Yoshida et al.,2002; Conner et al., 2019), fruit mummies (Moral and Trapero,2012; Samuelian et al., 2012; McKay et al., 2014), and buds (Vermaet al., 2006; Stensvand et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018). In somehosts like strawberry and Citrus spp., the pathogen survives asmelanized appressoria on asymptomatic leaves (Denham andWaller, 1981; Leandro et al., 2001). The pathogen can also beintroduced in the field with infected seeds (Thomas andFrontiers in Plant Science 03Sweetingham, 2004) or transplants (Howard et al., 1992); infectedseeds and transplants, however, are not considered as primaryinoculum sources in our model, because we assume that farmersuse pathogen-free propagating material.

Primary inoculum consists of fresh conidia produced in acervuliunder favorable conditions of temperature (10 to 30°C for most ofthe clades) and moisture (e.g., wetness periods longer than 6 h) onoverwintered sources for the entire cropping season (Moral andTrapero, 2012; Stensvand et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018). Conidiaare splash-dispersed by rain (Denham and Waller, 1981;Chakraborty and Billard, 1995; Madden et al., 1996; Madden,1997; Guyot et al., 2005; Buirchell et al., 2006), are deposited onplant surfaces, and germinate; the germ tubes then produceappressoria that in turn produce infection pegs that penetrate thehost cuticle and epidermal cell walls (Perfect et al., 1999).

Penetration through stomata or wounds by germ tubes withoutthe formation of appressoria is rare (Zulfiqar et al., 1996). Theinfection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after asymptomless biotrophic phase and results in a necrotic phase inwhich host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow intra- andinter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogenhas a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), and theswitch to the necrotrophic phase occurs only when host tissue andenvironmental conditions become conducive to the continuation ofthe infection cycle. Except for those few species that exist entirely asendophytes, the majority of Colletotrichum species develop anecrotrophic stage at some point in their life cycle (Pruskyet al., 2013).

Acervuli finally develop within lesions and produce masses ofconidia that serve as secondary inoculum for the repetition ofinfection cycles and the further spread of the disease (Peres et al.,2005; De Silva et al., 2017).

2.3 Model developmentInformation from the literature was organized in a relationaldiagram representing the epidemic structure as developed byZadoks (1971) and by using the systems analysis syntax (Leffelaarand Ferrari, 1989; Rossi et al., 2010; Rossi et al., 2015) (Figure 2 andTable 1). In this structure, the crop is composed of a large but finitenumber of sites that have equal dimensions and equal probability ofbecoming infected; a site is defined as a fraction of the host tissueswhere an infection may occur and where a lesion may develop(Zadoks, 1971; Savary et al., 2015). During the epidemic, a site goesthrough the following stages: healthy, infected without visiblelesions (latent infection), infected with visible lesions (i.e., diseasesymptoms or signs), infected with fertile (i.e., sporulating) lesions,and finally, infected with no-longer sporulating lesions (or removedlesions). In the model, the site stages are state variables (boxes); theflow from one stage to the next (solid arrows) is regulated by rates(valves), which are in turn influenced by external and auxiliaryvariables (short segments and circles, respectively). The externalvariables include weather variables such as air temperature (T, in °C), wetness duration (WD, in h), and rainfall (P, in mm).

For equation development and parameterization, the originaldata for each response (independent) variable collected in differentexperiments were rescaled between 0 and 1 by dividing each valueby the maximum value obtained in each experiment. This wasnecessary because the experiments often used differentmeasurement units (e.g., conidia production has been expressedas the average number of conidia per lesion, the number of conidiaFrontiers in Plant Science 05per cm2 of a lesion, or the number of conidia per Petri dish inlaboratory experiments, depending on the paper), fungal species orstrains, host plants, etc. As an example of rescaling, Wilson et al.

(1990) reported that 4 and 24 h of continuous wetness duringinfection on strawberry fruits by C. acutatum gave a diseaseincidence of 2 and 100%, respectively; therefore, the rescaled datawere x4h = 2/100 = 0.2, and x24h = 100/100 = 1.

Rescaled data were regressed against the influencingenvironmental factors (the independent variables). Differentnonlinear regression models were fit, and the goodness-of-fit wasTABLE 1 ContinuedAcronym Description UnitP Hourly rainfall mmT Hourly air temperature °CTeq Equivalent of temperature 0 to 1Tmax Maximum temperature for sporulation °CTmin Minimum temperature for sporulation °CVPD Vapor pressure deficit hPaWD Duration of a wet period N hourDriving functionsf1(P) Equation for the effect of rainfall on conidial dispersal and deposition on host tissues 0 to 1f2(P) Equation for the effect of rainfall on the wash-off of conidia from host tissues 0 to 1f(T) Equation for the effect of temperature on sporulation, or incubation or latency 0 to 1f(WD) Equation for the effect of wetness duration on sporulation, or conidial infectionf’(WD) First derivative of the equation for the effect of wetness duration on sporulation 0 to 1RcT Rc modifier for temperature 0 to 1RcWD Rc modifier for wetness duration 0 to 1fronta0 to 1 refers to a dimensionless, continuous variable.

Equation parameters wereestimated using the function nls of the “stats” package of R software(Team, R Core. R: A Language and Environment for StatisticalComputing. 2019; available at https://www.r-project.org/). Forparameter estimation, the data obtained from differentexperiments were considered to be replicates; the data concerningthe different species belonging to the same clade were alsoconsidered to be replicates.

The goodness-of-fit of equations to original (rescaled) data wasevaluated based on the adjusted R2, the concordance correlationcoefficient (CCC), the root mean square error (RMSE), and thecoefficient of residual mass (CRM) (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970; Lin,1989). The adjusted R2 was estimated by conducting a linearregression between the observed values and the model predictedvalues; the linear regression was conducted with the lm function ofthe R “stats” package (Wickham, 2019). CCC is an indication of thedifference between the best fitting line and the perfect agreementline (if CCC = 1, the agreement is perfect) (Lin, 1989). CCC wasobtained using the CCC function of the R “DescTools” package(Signorell, 2020). RMSE, which represents the average distance ofreal data from the fitted line (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970), wasobtained using the rmse function of the R “modeler” package(Wickham, 2019). CRM was calculated as described in Manstrettaand Rossi (2015); CRM is a measure of the tendency of the equationto overestimate or underestimate the observed values (a negativeCRM indicates a tendency of the model toward overestimation;Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970).

The model was developed and run in Excel® (Microsoft 365®).

2.4 Model evaluationWe evaluated the ability of the model to describe real epidemicsby using 17 disease progress curves (or epidemics) obtained fromFrontiers in Plant Science 06field data and retrieved from the literature. Details onColletotrichum species and clades, primary inoculum origin(natural or artificial), hosts, and experimental sites used for modelvalidation are summarized in Table 2.

In the validation, we assumed that each epidemic is triggered bya potential quantity of inoculum sources (represented by theparameter k in equation [1]), which are responsible for theproduction of primary conidia. The values of k used to initializethe model are reported in Table 2. Because there was noinformation in the literature for an exact calculation of theparameter k for each epidemic, the values in Table 2 wereestimated empirically, i.e., we selected the value of k that resultedin the closest agreement between predicted and observed diseaseseverities by running the model with varying values of k (in the rage0 to 1).

For epidemics resulting from natural inoculum, the model wasoperated starting from January 1. For epidemics triggered by theexperimental placement of diseased plants (see epidemics MA-14and MA-15 in Table 2) or diseased fruit (see epidemics OH-90 andOH-91 in Table 2) in the crop or near the crop, the model wasoperated starting from the day in which the diseased plants or fruitwere placed in the field. For MA-14 and MA-15, the inoculum wasintroduced by the sowing of Colletotrichum-infested white beanseeds (along with non-infested seeds), which developed into plantsthat produced the primary conidia; the model was operated fromJune 2 at MA-14 and from June 9 at MA-1. For OH-90 and OH-91,the inoculum was provided by Colletotrichum-diseased strawberryfruits that experimenters placed within the crop, and the model wasoperated from July 16 at OH-90 and from August 7 at OH-91.Predicted disease severities (i.e., sum of visible, infectious, andremoved sites) and observed disease severities were compared, andCCC, RMSE, and CRM (Nash and Sutcliffe, 1970; Lin, 1989), whichwere used to evaluate the goodness-of-fit of predicted vs. observeddata, were calculated by using R software as described before.

3 Results3.1 Model descriptionThe relational diagram of the processes leading to epidemics ofColletotrichum spp. is shown in Figure 2; abbreviations areexplained in Table 1. The model is based on host sites, each ofwhich belongs to one of the following mutually exclusiveconditions: (i) healthy (H); (ii) latent (L), i.e., without diseaseFrontiers in Plant Science 07symptoms; (iii) visible (V), i.e., with visible lesions; (iv) infectious(I), i.e., with visible lesions producing spores; and (iv) removed (R),i.e., older and non-sporulating lesions removed from the system.

The model does not incorporate host growth and senescence anddoes not account for lesion expansion.

Sites become infected (i.e., they change from healthy sites intolatent sites) at an infection rate (INFR), which depends on theabundance of conidia (CON), which can be both primary (CON’)and secondary (CON”) conidia, and on their rain-dependentdispersal rate (DISR). Primary conidia (produced on koverwintered inoculum sources at a sporulation rate of SPOR’)and secondary conidia (produced on lesions on the host plant at asporulation rate of SPOR”) accumulate in CON’ and CON”,respectively; SPOR’ depends on temperature and wetnessduration, and SPOR” depends only on temperature because theTABLE 2 Summary description of the 17 epidemics used for model evaluation and source of weather data used to operate the model.

Infection rate also depends on a correction factor (CF) for diseasedsites (i.e., stages L, V, I, and R), a multiplication factor (Rc)representing the proportion of daughter lesions generated permother lesion that depends on temperature (RcT) and wetnessduration (RcWD). Infection occurs during the period of hostsusceptibility (HS), which is regulated by the plant growth stageand varies with the host. Latent sites become visible at the end of anincubation period (IP), and visible sites become infectious at theend of a latency period (LP), both of which depend on temperature;the progress of IP and LP depends on an incubation (INCR) andlatency (LATR) rate, respectively. Infectious sites producesecondary conidia (CON”) during the infectious period (iP)and finally become removed at a removal rate (REMR)(Figure 2, Table 1).

At the beginning of model calculations, H = 1 (i.e., the wholecrop is healthy), and the model represents the flow from one state tothe following one as a proportion of the H, i.e., on a 0 to 1 scale. Themodel works at hourly time steps.

3.1.1 Production of primary inoculumThe model considers that the primary inoculum consists ofconidia (CON’) produced by k inoculum sources at a sporulationrate (SPOR’) that depends on temperature and wet periods. On anyith hour, the model calculates SPOR’ as follows:SPOR 0   =   k  �   f(T)  �   f 0 (WD) (1)where the parameter k (ranging from 0 to 1) represents theabundance of primary inoculum sources; f(T) accounts for the effectof temperature (T, °C) on the production of conidia; f’(WD)Frontiers in Plant Science 08accounts for the effect of wetness duration (WD, hours) on theproduction of conidia, and is calculated as the first derivative ofequation (3). Values of SPOR’ accumulate in CON’.The effect of temperature is calculated by a BETE equation(Analytis, 1977) in the following form:f(T)   =   (a  �  Teqb  �   (1   –  Teq))c (2)where a to c = equation parameters, and Teq = temperatureequivalent in the form Teq = (T–Tmin)/(Tmax–Tmin). For thelatter equation, T = hourly temperature, and Tmin and Tmax =minimum and maximum temperature for sporulation, respectively.

Tmin, Tmax, and equation parameters of each clade were derivedfrom Salotti et al. (2022).

Whenever there are ≥ 3 continuous hours of wetness, the effectof moisture is calculated as follows (Leandro et al., 2001):if WD ≥ 3, thenf(WD)   =   exp   ( – 5:947  �   exp   ( – 0:067  �  WD)) (3)otherwise, f(WD) = 0.

where WD refers to leaf wetness duration (for the hostpathogen combinations in which the inoculum source is locatedin the aerial part of the plant, e.g., hanging mummies or bud scales)or ground wetness duration (when the source lays on the ground,e.g., plant debris, leaf litter, or mummies in soil). In the model, theground is considered wet in hours when rainfall (P) > 0 mm orvapour pressure deficit (VPD) ≤ 4.5 hPa; otherwise, the ground isconsidered dry (Rossi et al., 2008); VPD is calculated fromtemperature and relative humidity (RH, in %) following Buck(1981). To calculate WD, wet hours are accumulated until a dryhour occurs; if wetness is restored within 16 h, WD continues toTABLE 2 ContinuedLocation year Year Hostc Period Epidemic Weather datad1982 15 daysJun 15 – Sep 7NC-82aGraminicola cladeEast Lansing, Michigan, USA (Danneberger et al.,1984)1982 Bluegrass 10 daysMay 9 – Jul 27MI-82a Capital Region airport (42°46’N, 84°35’W);11 kmNorth Brunswick, New Jersey, USA; (Hempfling et al.,2020)2009 7 daysJul 31 – Aug31NJ-09a Linden airport (40°36’N, 74°14’W); 28 km2010 7 daysJul 23 – Aug12NJ-10aOrbiculare cladeMorden, Manitoba, Canada 2014 Dry beancv.

Equation (3) was developed and parameterized by fitting thedata from Leandro et al. (2003) and Moral and Trapero (2012),which refer to the acutatum clade. Estimates and standard errors ofequation parameters were 5.947 ± 1.329 and 0.067 ± 0.009, withadjusted R2 = 0.910, CCC = 0.953, RMSE = 0.116, and CRM = 0.041.

Because no information was found in the literature on the effect ofmoisture on sporulation for the other Colletotrichum clades,equation (2) was used for all clades.

3.1.2 Dispersal of conidiaThe model considers that conidia that accumulated (CON’ forprimary conidia and CON” for secondary conidia) are dispersed tohost plants at a dispersal rate (DISR) that depends on precipitation(P, in mm h–1) (Madden et al., 1996; Madden, 1997; Ntahimperaet al., 1999; Guyot et al., 2005), with a minimum of 0.3 mm of rainh–1 (Guyot et al., 2005). On any ith hour, the model calculates DISRas follows:if P ≥ 0.3, thenDISR   =   f1(P)  �   (1   –   f2(P)) (4)otherwise, DISR = 0.

where f1(P) accounts for the dispersal of conidia and theirdeposition on host tissues, and f2(P) accounts for the washing-off ofconidia from host tissues due to precipitation intensity > 15 mm h-1(Madden et al., 1996). f1(P) is calculated as follows:f1(P)   =   exp   ( – 2:5  �   exp( – 0:15  �  P)) (5)if P > 15, thenf2(P)   =   1   =   (1   +   966:9  �   exp   ( – 0:133  �  P)) (6)otherwise, f2(P) = 0.

Equation (5) was developed and parameterized by fitting the dataof Madden et al. (1996) and Ntahimpera et al. (1999); estimates andstandard errors of equation parameters were 2.5 ± 0.84 and 0.15 ±0.04, with adjusted R2 = 0.895, CCC = 0.953, RMSE = 0.099, andCRM = 0.002. Equation (6) was developed and parameterized byfitting the data of Madden et al. (1996); estimates and standard errorsof equation parameters were 966.9 ± 16.4 and 0.133 ± 0.003, withadjusted R2 = 0.999, CCC = 0.999, RMSE = 0.004, and CRM = 0.002.

3.1.3 Infection by conidiaConidia on the plant surface cause infection according to aninfection rate (INFR), which modulates the transfer of sites fromhealthy to latent. INFR is calculated as follows:INFR   =  HS  �  CON  �  DISR  �  Rc  �  CF (7)where HS defines whether the host plant is susceptible (HS=1)or not (HS=0); CON is the sum of CON’ and CON”; Rc is a basicinfection rate (Vanderplank, 1963); and CF is a correction factor fordiseased sites, and is calculated as follows:CF   =   1   –   (D   =   (D   +  H)) (8)Frontiers in Plant Science 09where D is the sum of disease sites (D = L + V + I + R) and Hrepresents healthy sites.

The model accounts for changes in the susceptibility of the hostto infection by introducing the correction factor HS into equation(7). HS is defined for each host depending on the species andgrowth stage. For epidemics occurring on green tissues (leaves,stems, etc.), the model assumes that the plants are susceptible fromthe appearance of the organ to the end of the season (i.e., harvest forherbaceous hosts; leaf fall for trees and bushes). For epidemicsoccurring on fruits, HS strictly depends on the reproductive growthstage of the host. For instance, grapevine berries are susceptiblefrom fruit set (BBCH 71; Lorenz et al., 1994) to harvest (BBCH 89;Lorenz et al., 1994; Cosseboom and Hu, 2022), and olive drupes aresusceptible from the beginning of flowering (BBCH 61; Sanz-Cortéset al., 2002) to harvest (BBCH 89; Sanz-Cortés et al., 2002; Moralet al., 2009).

In equation (7), Rc represents the proportion of daughterlesions generated per mother lesion. Following Savary et al.

(2015), Rc depends on the optimum corrected basic infection rate(RcOPT), which is the basic infection rate under optimumenvironmental conditions on a susceptible host, and on modifiersfor the effect of temperature (RcT) and wetness duration (RcWD)(Loomis and Adams, 1983) as follows:Rc   =  RcOPT  �  RcT  �  RcWD (9)The value of RcOPT is estimated following Sun and Zeng (1994)for each Colletotrichum clade from disease progress curves asfollows:RcOPT   =   r   =   (exp   ( – r  �   p)   –   exp   ( – r  �   (i   +   p)))(10)where p is the latency period under favorable conditions, i is theinfectious period under favorable conditions, and r is the apparentinfection rate (Vanderplank, 1963; Vanderplank, 1975) and iscalculated as follows:r   =   ln(x2=   x1)   =   (t2   –   t1) (11)where x1 and x2 are disease fractions on two successive dates (t1and t2) at the early stage of the epidemic under conditionsconducive to the disease. To calculate r, published diseaseprogress curves in susceptible and unprotected crops were used;the first two non-zero severity values (expressed on a 0 to 1 scale)were spotted from these curves and used for the calculation. Foreach clade, values of RcOPT, p, i, r, and references for the diseaseprogress curves used to calculate r are summarized in Table 3. Thevalues of p were defined based on studies on latency reported inTable 4. Irrespective of the clade, the value of i was set at 28 daysbased on King et al. (1997).

The modifier RcT accounts for the effect of air temperature oninfection, and is calculated as a BETE equation (Analytis, 1977) inthe form of equation (3); Tmin and Tmax for infection by conidiaand equation parameters were derived from Salotti et al. (2022) foreach clade.

For the acutatum clade, equation (12) was developed andparametreized by fitting the data of Wilson et al. (1990);Turechek et al. (2006); Gillett and Schilder (2009); Bertetti et al.

(2009); Diéguez-Uribeondo et al. (2011); Moral et al. (2012); Mileset al. (2013); Greer et al. (2014); Rodriguez-Salamanca et al. (2015),and Gonçalves et al. (2021). For the coccodes clade, equation (12)was developed and parameterized by fitting the data of Andersenand Walker (1985); Dillard (1989); Byrne et al. (1998); Hong andHwang (1998); Sanogo et al. (2003), and Rodriguez-Salamanca et al.

For thecoccodes clade, equation parameters and their standard errors wered = 7.343 ± 0.696, e = 0.164 ± 0.028, with adjusted R2 = 0.956, CCC= 0.979, RMSE = 0.083, and CRM = 0.008.

For the dematium clade, equation (13) was developed andparameterized by fitting the data of Uysal and Kurt (2017):f(WD)   =   1   –   exp   ( – 0:1  �  WD) (13)The equation parameter and its standard error were 0.10 ± 0.02,with R2 = 0.865, CCC = 0.943, RMSE = 0.09, and CRM = –0.004.

For the destructivum clade, equation (14) was developed andparametreized by fitting the data of Chongo and Bernier (2000). Forthe gloeosporioides clade, equation (14) was developed andparameterized by fitting the data of Griffin et al. (1987);Chakraborty et al. (1990); Yun and Park (1990); Hildebrand andJensen (1991); Pandey et al. (1997); Luo and TeBeest (1999);Monteiro et al. (2009); Guyader et al. (2013); Wang et al. (2015);Zhao et al. (2020), and Gonçalves et al. (2021). For the orbiculareclade, equation (14) was developed and parametreized by fitting thedata of Auld et al. (1989); Monroe et al. (1997), and Dalla Pria et al.

Frontiers in Plant Science 10(2003):f(WD)   =   (1   –   f  �   exp   ( – g  �  WD))(1   =   (1  −   h)) (14)For destructivum clade, equation parameters and their standarderrors were f = 1.0 ± 0.274, g = 0.201 ± 0.157, and h = 0.635 ± 0.162,with adjusted R2 = 0.885, CCC = 0.952, RMSE = 0.105, andCRM = 0.024. For gloeosporioides clade, equation parameters andtheir standard errors were f = 1.0 ± 0.167, g = 0.157 ± 0.039, and h =0.8 ± 0.064, with adjusted R2 = 0.939, CCC = 0.968, RMSE = 0.098,and CRM = 0.041. For orbiculare clade, equation parameters andtheir standard errors were f = 0.9 ± 0.157, g = 0.168 ± 0.061, and h =0.738 ± 0.083, with adjusted R2 = 0.904, CCC = 0.954, RMSE =0.107, and CRM = 0.019.

For the truncatum clade, equation (15) was developed andparameterized by fitting the data of Singh et al. (2017):f(WD)   =   1   =   (1   +   50:0  �   exp   ( – 0:289  �  WD)) (15)Equation parameters and their standard errors were 50.0 ±2.473 and 0.289 ± 0.039, with adjusted R2 = 0.988, CCC = 0.989,RMSE = 0.057, and CRM = –0.041.

No information on the effect of WD on infection was retrievedfor the graminicola clade. The model assumes that there is asimilarity between the infection pattern of the graminicola anddestructivum clades on the basis of the inter-clade variability studiesof Salotti et al. (2022); the model therefore calculates RcWD for thegraminicola clade by using equation (14) as parameterized for thedestructivum clade.

3.1.4 Incubation and latency periodsSites flow from L to V at an incubation rate (INCR, whichdepends on IP, i.e., the incubation period), and then from V to Iwith a latency rate (LATR, which depends on LP, i.e., the latencyperiod). In each ith hour, the model calculates the hourly progress ofboth IP and LP as a function of temperature by using the equationof Magarey et al. (2005) in the following form:pi   =   f(T)   =   IPmin (16)TABLE 3 Estimates of the optimum corrected basic infection rate (RcOPT) for eight Colletotrichum clades, latency period under favorable conditionsfor epidemics (p), infectious period under favorable conditions for epidemics (i), and publications reporting disease progress curves on a susceptiblehost variety used to calculate the apparent infection rate (r).

(2022), parameters estimatedfor the acutatum clade were applied to the dematium clade.

The model accumulates the hourly progress of incubation andlatency beginning with the hour when the infection has occurred;when the sum of hourly progress results in IP ≥1, INCR = 1 and sitesflow from L to V; when the sum of hourly progress results in LP ≥1,LATR = 1 and sites flow from V to I.3.1.5 Infectious period and secondaryinoculum productionInfectious sites (I) continue producing conidia for an infectionperiod (iP), and then flow from I to R according to a removal rate(REMR). The model assumes that fertile lesions continue toproduce conidia for the entire epidemic, so that REMR = 0. The Isites produce secondary conidia at a sporulation rate (SPOR”) thatdepends on temperature according to equation (2); the secondaryconidia accumulate in CON”. Based on King et al. (1997), the modelassumes that the pathogen obtains sufficient moisture from the hostto produce conidia and does not require free surface moisturefor sporulation.

The contribution of secondary inoculum to the progress of theepidemic has been proved for some host-pathogen combinations(Fitzell and Peak, 1984; Smith, 2008; Everett et al., 2018), but not forothers. In olive orchards, for instance, mummies are the mainsource of inoculum all season long, and the contribution of conidiaproduced within fruit lesions is negligible (Moral et al., 2012); whenlesions do not contribute to the progress of the epidemic, CON” = 0.

3.1.6 Predicted disease severityThe model calculates disease severity (DS) during the epidemicas the sum of the proportion of sites with disease symptoms, i.e.,visible, infectious, and removed sites, as follows:DS   =  V +   I   +  R (19)3.2 Model evaluationThe model was validated for the acutatum, dematium,gloeosporioides, graminicola, and orbiculare clades. The model’sability to predict disease development throughout the season wasevaluated for 17 epidemics (Table 2) recorded between 1980 and 2019in Italy, the USA, Canada, and Japan on six hosts, i.e., olive,strawberry, mulberry, grape, bluegrass, and dry bean. In thismanuscript, only a few epidemics are described in detail; details onthe remaining epidemics are provided in the Supplementary material.

For the acutatum clade, model validation was performed for 4epidemics on drupes recorded in naturally infested olive orchards inSouth Italy, and 2 epidemics in artificially infested strawberry fieldsin Ohio, USA; in the latter case, researchers provided the inoculumby placing affected fruit between the strawberry rows. Epidemics onolive developed between August and December, with final diseaseincidence on drupes ranging from 7% to 26% (Table 5); CCCbetween predicted and observed disease ranged from 0.789 to 0.953,and RMSE ranged from 0.022 to 0.047. Epidemics in the twoFrontiers in Plant Science 12strawberry fields occurred in July to August in OH-90, and inAugust to September in OH-91, with final disease incidences of 28%and 45%, respectively; in the comparison of predicted and observeddisease, CCC = 0.874 and 0.898, and RMSE = 0.055 and 0.061,respectively (Table 5). Across all 6 epidemics of the acutatum clade,CCC = 0.895, RMSE = 0.048, and CRM = −0.099 (the latterindicated a slight tendency of the model toward overestimation).

An example of model output for acutatum clade is shown inFigure 3 for IT-17A. In the olive orchard, flowering (BBCH 61,i.e., the beginning of host susceptibility) began on May 15, andharvest occurred at the end of December. From mid-May to the endof December, the average daily temperature was 20.3°C (min =4.5°C, max = 31.1°C), with an average RH = 71%, a total of 365 mmof rain on 69 rainy days, and a total of 1617 h of leaf wetness(Figure 3A). Rains were frequent and intense between Septemberand November, with prolonged wetness periods that led to theprediction of repeated infection periods (Figure 3B). Diseaseoutbreak occurred on August 17 (disease incidence 2%) and wasfollowed by a regular disease increase that resulted in a final diseaseincidence of 18%, which was correctly predicted by the model(Figure 3B). For IT-17A, CCC = 0.953, RMSE = 0.022, and CRM =0.017 (the latter indicated no substantial underestimation).

For the dematium clade, 3 disease progress curves on mulberryin Japan were used to validate the model (Table 2). Epidemicsdeveloped on mulberry leaves between August and November, withfinal disease incidence ranging from 13% to 37%. In the comparisonof observed and predicted disease progress curves, CCC rangedfrom 0.862 to 0.991 and RMSE ranged from 0.014 to 0.055; acrossall three epidemics, CCC = 0.95, RMSE = 0.036, and CRM = −0.023(the latter indicated a slight tendency toward overestimation(Table 5). An example of model output for the dematium clade isshown in Figure 4 for JA-94. Disease assessment began in June afterthe summer-pruning of mulberry trees, and ended in November.During this period, the average daily temperature was 21.9°C (min= 7.0°C, max = 30.1°C), with an average RH = 82%, a total of 625.5mm of rain on 61 rainy days, and a total of 1688 h of leaf wetness(Figure 4A). Regularly distributed rainfall ensured that the epidemicwould progress during the season, starting from the time of diseaseonset in August until November when a sharp increase in diseaseled to a 37% disease incidence (Figure 4B). The model correctlypredicted this dynamic; across all three epidemics, CCC = 0.991,RMSE = 0.02, and CRM = 0.078.

Model validation for the gloeosporioides clade was performedfor 3 epidemics on grapevines in North Carolina, USA (Table 2).

These epidemics developed between June and September, with finaldisease incidence on berries ranging from 24% to 54%. A smallaverage distance of real data from the fitted line was observed forthe three epidemics, with RMSE ranging from 0.012 to 0.101.

Concordance between observed and predicted values for NC-80and NC-82 gave CCC = 0.843 and 0.993, respectively. The NC-81epidemic is reported in Figure 5. Berries were susceptible betweenJune 9 (BBCH 71, i.e., fruit set) and October 1 (BBCH 89, i.e.,berries ripe for harvest). During this period, the average dailytemperature was 24.6°C (min = 14.5°C, max = 29.8°C), with anaverage RH = 77%, a total of 216.1 mm of rain on 31 rainy days, anda total of 746 h of leaf wetness (Figure 5A).

Contrary to observations, themodel anticipated by some days the observed increase in disease atthe end of the season (Figure 5B), and CCC = 0.497, probablybecause of an imprecise estimation of the incubation length inrelation to the berry growth stage at the time of infection. In thecomparison of predicted and observed disease progress curves forthe 3 epidemics of the gloeosporioides clade, CCC = 0.910, RMSE =0.068, and CRM = −0.109 (the latter indicated a slight tendency ofthe model toward overestimation).

Model validation for the graminicola clade was performed for 3bluegrass epidemics in New Jersey, USA, in 2009 and 2010, andMichigan, USA, in 1982 (Table 2). The epidemics were observedbetween May and August, with final disease severity ranging from16% to 41%. In the comparison of model output and observed data,CCC ranged from 0.947 to 0.997, RMSE ranged from 0.006 to 0.037(Table 5), and CRM ranged from −0.15 to 0.19 (the latter indicateda slight over- or underestimation of observed disease progressFrontiers in Plant Science 13curves, depending on the epidemic). Across all three epidemics ofthe graminicola clade, CCC = 0.973, RMSE = 0.026, and CRM =0.018 (the latter indicated a slight tendency of the model towardunderestimation). An example of model output for the graminicolaclade is shown in Figure 6. At MI-82, the bluegrass field wasinspected at 10-day intervals for anthracnose symptoms from thebeginning of May to the end of July. During this period, the averagedaily temperature was 18.9°C (min = 10.6°C, max = 26.7°C), with anaverage RH = 75%, a total of 202.6 mm of rain on 31 rainy days, anda total of 651 h of leaf wetness (Figure 6A). The disease outbreak atMI-82 occurred on July 7 (disease severity 3%), and the diseaseincreased regularly to a final disease incidence of 25%, which wascorrectly predicted by the model (Figure 6B), with CCC = 0.997,RMSE = 0.006, and CRM = 0.050 (the latter indicated a slighttendency of the model toward underestimation).

To validate the model for the orbiculare clade, 2 epidemics thatoccurred on white bean in Manitoba, Canada were used (Table 2).

Crops were scouted for disease from the end of June, when artificialTABLE 5 Epidemics considered for model validation.

At MA-14,the disease was recorded only in traces (<1%), so that proper modelevaluation was impossible. At MA-15 (Figure 7), the average dailytemperature was 18.9°C (min = 10.6°C, max = 26.7°C), with anaverage RH = 75%, a total of 202.6 mm of rain on 31 rainy days, anda total of 651 h of leaf wetness (Figure 7A). Regularly distributedrainfalls and prolonged wet periods ensured a progressivedevelopment of the epidemic from the first third of July untilmid-August, with a final disease severity of 20%. The model slightlyoverestimated the disease dynamics in the second half of July(Figure 7B), with CCC = 0.896, RMSE = 0.035, and CRM = 0.19(the latter indicated a tendency of the model towardunderestimation). Across both orbiculare clade epidemics, CCC =0.931, RMSE = 0.027, and CRM = 0.158 (the latter indicated atendency of the model toward underestimation).

In an overall comparison of predicted versus observed values forthe 17 epidemics listed in Table 5, CCC = 0.928 and RMSE = 0.044;the similarity between the observed data and the fitted line indicatedthat the model accurately represented the mechanisms leading toColletotrichum epidemics on different host plants. The model,however, showed a slight tendency toward overestimation (CRM= −0.052) when evaluated for the epidemics on different host plants.

The variance explained by the relationship of observed versuspredicted data was R2 = 0.866; based on Theils’ statistic, thedeviation from the unexplained variance was Uerror = 86%,whereas the percentage of error associated with model bias anddeviation from the 1:1 line was Ubias = 2% and Uslope =12%, respectively.

Frontiers in Plant Science 164 DiscussionIn this research, we developed a general, weather-driven,mechanistic model for the prediction of anthracnose diseasescaused by Colletotrichum spp. on aerial plant parts of differenthosts in the field. Previous models for anthracnose diseases werespecies- and crop-specific and considered only one component ofthe pathogen life cycle, mainly conidial infection (Dodd et al., 1991;Park et al., 1992; Monroe et al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh,2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that thiskind of model has been developed, calibrated for different cladesand host plants, and evaluated to make predictions of anthracnosepatterns on multiple crops.

Our model is “general” in that it has one conceptual structurethat incorporates the key epidemiological components ofanthracnose diseases. Even though Colletotrichum spp. exhibitnumerous lifestyles–which have been categorized as necrotrophic,hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic, withhemibiotrophic being the most common (Peres et al., 2005; DeSilva et al., 2017)–all of the species have a necrotrophic stage(Prusky et al., 2013), except for the few species that live entirelyas endophytes (e.g., some species in the gloeosporioides clade onSalacia and Camellia; Bhagya et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). Thetiming of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on thehost, its growth stage, and environmental conditions (Whartonet al., 2001; Peres et al., 2005), as well as the phylogenetic clade (DeSilva et al., 2017). For instance, graminicola and destructivumclades have a short biotrophic period, while acutatum andBAFIGURE 7Predicted and observed disease progress on dry bean for the orbiculare clade in Morden, Manitoba, Canada, in 2015 (MA-15).

Our model accountsfor the common attributes of the Colletotrichum lifestyles in termsof (i) a reproductive (asexual) stage, which occurs on the host plantor in plant debris; (ii) infection caused by conidia; (iii) anasymptomatic (biotrophic) stage that can be short or extended(depending on an incubation period); (iv) a necrotrophic stage inwhich host cells are invaded and killed, with the appearance ofsymptoms (lesions in our model); and (v) a sporulation stage, i.e.,the production of secondary inoculum on lesions.

Our model is weather driven in that it accounts for the effects oftemperature, wetness duration, and rain on the epidemiologicalcomponents leading to disease development. The model works withan hourly time step to better account for fluctuations intemperature, as well as in wetness duration and wetnessinterruption that directly influence the epidemiological processes.

This ensures more accurate and robust predictions than providedby models that work with a daily time step (Scherm and VanBruggen, 1994; Narouei-Khandan et al., 2020). To be incorporatedinto our model, however, new information must have an hourlytime step.

To design and calibrate the model, we performed a systematicliterature search in order to collect published information on thebiological processes involved in the development of epidemics andthe weather conditions affecting these processes. Locating andassembling published knowledge by means of a systematicapproach reduces errors, limits search bias, and improves thesynthesis of research findings (Candel, 2014; Scherm et al., 2014),facilitating the application of system analysis to the collectedinformation (Rossi et al., 2015). Organization of the availableknowledge on the basis of system analysis revealed incompleteinformation for some biological processes or for some clades(especially the dematium and graminicola clades); to deal withthis incomplete information, we made simplifications, made explicitassumptions, and/or used data from related clades for both modeldesign and calibration.

The first simplification in the design of our model concerns therole of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruitingbodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species inthe gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola caldes (De Silvaet al., 2017). Perithecia, however, rarely occur in the field (Dowlinget al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or mainkind of inoculum in disease development. The model thereforefocuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, and asexual spores(conidia) produced in acervuli are considered as the only inoculumresponsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics.

Exclusion of a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporicinoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculumdose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein,1963), so delaying the epidemic growth (Schein, 1963) especially inrainless periods, because ascospores are forcibly discharged fromperithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity(Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).

A second simplification concerns the model’s structure. Themodel is based on the well-established framework designed byZadoks (1971), in which host sites go from healthy, to infectedFrontiers in Plant Science 17with latent infection, to infected with visible lesions, to infectious,and finally to removed (sites with sterile lesions). This structure hasbeen successfully applied to many pathosystems, under differentclimates, and on cereals and dicotyledon crops (Djurle and Yuen,1991; Rossi et al., 1997; Savary et al., 2015; Bove et al., 2020). Thismodel structure assumes that all sites have equal size, that healthysites have an equal probability to become diseased, and that diseasedsites are randomly distributed. For those anthracnose diseases inwhich lesions enlarge, such as occurs on apple (Grammen et al.,2019; Nita et al., 2019) and strawberry (Garrido et al., 2008), theassumption that lesions are equal in size could lead to anunderestimation of both disease severity and the dose ofsecondary conidia; a lesion expansion component (Berger et al.,1997) could be easily integrated into the model for those cases.

Given that Colletotrichum conidia are splash-borne, with shortflight distances of splash droplets from the source, theassumption that diseased sites are randomly distributed is likelyto be wrong, i.e., diseased sites are likely to be aggregated in space(Madden, 1997); therefore, the assumptions that all sites have anequal probability to become affected could result in anoverestimation of disease severity. The introduction of a diseaseaggregation coefficient for the calculation of infection rate couldaccount for the spatial heterogeneity in disease distribution(Waggoner and Rich, 1981).

A third simplification of model design refers to the host plant.

The model does not consider host growth and senescence, and onlyuses the growth stage to determine the periods in which plants aresusceptible to infection or not. Crop growth and senescence causechanges over time of the leaf area and, consequently, of healthy sites(Bove et al., 2020). Our simplification could therefore lead to anoverestimation of healthy sites in the early season when the canopyis growing, or in late season when sites become senescent, both ofwhich could both result in an overestimation of the disease severity.

As before, the model structure could be modified by insertingcomponents for host growth and senescence (Savary et al., 2015;Bove et al., 2020). That the host can be either susceptible or not isalso a simplification in our model, because there are cases in whichfruits show various levels of susceptibility to infection, and in whichthe switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on physiologicaland biochemical changes during the fruit ripening process (Moralet al., 2009; Moral et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Nekoduka et al.,2018; López-Moral et al., 2019).

The model was calibrated for seven major clades (i.e., acutatum,dematium, destructivum, gloeosporioides, graminicola, andorbiculare) and the singleton species C. coccodes (considered asthe coccodes clade in the current research). Calibration was done atthe clade level because of the scarcity of information at the specieslevel; when there was no information for a specific clade, the modelwas operated by using the parameterization of other clades. Thiswas the case for the effect of wetness on sporulation from primarysources only for the acutatum clade on olive and strawberry(Leandro et al., 2003; Moral and Trapero, 2012), and for theseasonal availability of primary inoculum only for the acutatumclade on olive (Moral and Trapero, 2012) only. Further studies areneeded to clarify the effect of wetness on primary inoculumproduction and on the longevity of primary inoculum sources. Afrontiersin.orghttps://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-sciencehttps://www.frontiersin.orgSalotti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092lack of information was also found for the effect of wetness oninfection by the graminicola clade and the effect of temperature onincubation and latency periods for the dematium clade. In thevalidation, the model was operated by using equations from theclosest related clade, i.e., by using equations from the destructivumclade for the graminicola clade and from the acutatum clade for thedematium clade (Salotti et al., 2022).

A clade-based calibration has some limitations. For instance,the acutatum clade, which affects strawberry, almond, olive, lupin,etc., showed great variability in incubation and latency periodsdepending on the host. At 15°C, the latency period was 5 days onstrawberry fruits (King et al., 1997), 19 days on olive fruits (Moralet al., 2012), and about 10 days on lupin (Diggle et al., 2002).

Because of this variability, the equations developed for suchpolyphagous clades had generally lower CCC values, higherRMSE values, and CRM values more distant from zero (Table 4).

Effects of high within-clade variability were further reflected in themodel validation results (Table 5), which showed that predictionswere better for clades that had a small number of species and hosts.

The acutatum and gloeosporioides clades, which include multiplespecies and hosts, had overall CCC values of 0.895 and 0.910,respectively. In contrast, the graminicola clade, which is a welldefined monophyletic clade encompassing Colletotrichum speciesmainly associated with grasses (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021),had the highest CCC value of 0.973.

Clade-based calibration may also have advantages. Anthracnosediseases have often been attributed to several Colletotrichum speciesbelonging to the same clade, depending on the region. For instance,the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are in the acutatumclade, with C. godetiae dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, andTunisia; with C. nymphaeae dominant in Portugal; and with C.fioriniae dominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). In addition,proper identification of the Colletotrichum species requiresmolecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009;Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Dammet al., 2014). Because the species belonging to the same clade showsimilar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a cladebased calibration may be useful to overcome knowledge gaps forsingle Colletotrichum species, to favor practical model usage whenthe identification of species is not possible because of capacity oreconomic limitations, and to make predictions for a wide range ofhosts and climatic conditions.

Given that the model was validated against independent data(i.e., data not used in model development) and provided accurateand robust predictions of anthracnose epidemics, we conclude thatour assumptions and simplifications did not greatly reduce themodel’s ability to make correct predictions. Overall, highconcordance was shown between model predictions and reality(CCC = 0.928), with few errors (RMSE = 0.044), and a slighttendency of the model toward overestimation (CRM = –0.052).

Unfortunately, data enabling model validation were available foronly five of the eight clades for which the model was parameterized(i.e., acutatum, dematium, gloeosporioides, graminicola, andorbiculare clades). Except for the acutatum clade, which wasvalidated on strawberry and olive, each clade was validated onFrontiers in Plant Science 18only one host. More complete validation is needed for differentclades and hosts.

In our model validation, the k dose of primary conidia that candevelop from overwintering inoculum sources (crop debris, mummies,and dormant buds) was estimated empirically from disease data; thisestimation may not greatly affect the reliability of the model to predictdisease progress because it modulates the final value of the diseaseseverity but not its progress. The real value of k in a field may dependon many difficult-to-estimate factors, including the incidence andseverity of affected crops in the previous season and the proportionof diseased tissues that remains in the field as an overwinteringinoculum source. Inappropriate estimation of k may result in underor overestimation of infection risk during the season. Further studiesare therefore needed to improve the estimation of the abundance ofprimary inoculum sources at the beginning of the cropping season.

Our model is flexible in both design and calibration. For instance,the model can easily incorporate components for lesion expansion,plant growth, senescence, or host susceptibility by integration ofadditional model components (Loomis and Adams, 1983) and ofmodifiers accounting for resistance components, as has been donewith similar models (Savary et al., 2015; Bove et al., 2021). Modelflexibility also enables easy incorporation of new information onpathogen biology and epidemiology, so that inserting species-specificor host-specific calibrations may improve the prediction accuracyespecially in hosts or in regions in which anthracnose disease iscaused by a dominant Colletotrichum species, or for clades notconsidered in this work such as the boniense clade, which iseconomically important on several Citrus spp. (Uysal and Kurt,2019; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).

In spite of some shortcomings mainly related to its simplicityand the scarcity of information available in the literature, our modelis promising. After further validation and evaluation of its ability tosupport risk-based fungicide applications, the model could be usedfor supporting decision-making in crop protection.

All taxa accepted within this clade are morphologically more or less typical of the broadly defined C. gloeosporioides, as it has been applied in the literature for the past 50 years. We accept 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides complex. These include C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. psidii, C. siamense, C. theobromicola, C. tropicale, and C. xanthorrhoeae, along with the taxa described here as new, C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alatae, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, C. salsolae, and C. ti, plus the nom. nov. C. queenslandicum (for C. gloeosporioides var. minus). All of the taxa are defined genetically on the basis of multi-gene phylogenies. Brief morphological descriptions are provided for species where no modern description is available. Many of the species are unable to be reliably distinguished using ITS, the official barcoding gene for fungi. Particularly problematic are a set of species genetically close to C. musae and another set of species genetically close to C. kahawae, referred to here as the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade, respectively. Each clade contains several species that are phylogenetically well supported in multi-gene analyses, but within the clades branch lengths are short because of the small number of phylogenetically informative characters, and in a few cases individual gene trees are incongruent. Some single genes or combinations of genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, can be used to reliably distinguish most taxa and will need to be developed as secondary barcodes for species level identification, which is important because many of these fungi are of biosecurity significance. In addition to the accepted species, notes are provided for names where a possible close relationship with C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has been suggested in the recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and its putative teleomorph Glomerella cingulata.

INTRODUCTIONThe name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was first proposed in Penzig (1882), based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, the type specimen of which was collected from Citrus in Italy. Much of the early literature used this name to refer to fungi associated with various diseases of Citrus, with other species established for morphologically similar fungi from other hosts. However, several early papers discussed the morphological similarity between many of the Colletotrichum spp. that had been described on the basis of host preference, and used inoculation tests to question whether or not the species were distinct. Some of these papers investigated in culture the link between the various Colletotrichum species and their sexual Glomerella state (e.g. Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia & Agati 1925). Authors such as Shear & Wood (1907, 1913) and Small (1926) concluded that many of the species described on the basis of host preference were in fact the same, rejecting apparent differences in host preference as a basis for taxonomic segregation. Small (1926) concluded that the names Glomerella cingulata and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides should be used for the sexual and asexual morphs, respectively, of the many Colletotrichum spp. they regarded as conspecific. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was stated to be the earliest name with a proven link to what they regarded as a biologically diverse G. cingulata. The studies of von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970) taxonomically formalised this concept. The “von Arxian” taxonomic concept for Colletotrichum saw large numbers of species synonymised with the names C. graminicola (for grass-inhabiting species) and C. gloeosporioides (for non-grass inhabiting species with straight conidia). The genetic and biological diversity encompassed by these names was so broad that they became of little practical use to plant pathologists, conveying no information about pathogenicity, host range, or other attributes. The von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957) studies were not based on direct examination of type material of all species and some of the synonymy proposed in these papers has subsequently been found to be incorrect. Examples include the segregation of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al. 2003) from C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1957). Other studies published elsewhere in this volume (Damm et al. 2012a, b) show that several species regarded as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957) are members of the C. acutatum complex (e.g. C. godetiae, Gloeosporium limetticola, G. lycopersici, and G. phormii) or the C. boninense complex (e.g. C. dracaenae). Recent molecular studies have resulted in a much better understanding of phylogenetic relationships amongst the StudieS in Mycology 73: 115–180.

116grass-inhabiting species of the C. graminicola group and the development of a more useful taxonomy for this group of fungi (e.g. Hsiang & Goodwin 2001, Du et al. 2005, and Crouch et al. 2006). This group is now recognised as comprising several host-specialised, genetically well characterised species, but a modern taxonomy for C. gloeosporioides has yet to be resolved.

Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C. gloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently host-specialised, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these authors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to understand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host species, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria, growth rate in culture, colour of cultures, presence or absence of setae, whether or not the teleomorph develops, etc. Some studies have found characters such as these useful for distinguishing groups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956, Hindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems arise because many of these morphological features change under different conditions of growth (dependent upon growth media, temperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or change with repeated subculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled — even good, welldefined pathogens causing a specific disease can be isolated by chance from other substrates (e.g. Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum conidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium, remain attached to that surface as a viable propagule or perhaps as a minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow out from there into senescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity. In addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct sets of isolates, the shared pathogenicity presumably independently evolved, e.g. the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members of both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes (Johnston et al. 2005). Sutton (1992) commented on C. gloeosporioides that “No progress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging to this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone”. A start was made towards a modern understanding of this name with the designation of an epitype specimen with a culture derived from it to stabilise the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs in a strongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have been confused with C. gloeosporioides in the past, such as C. acutatum and C. boninense (e.g. Abang et al. 2002, Martinez-Culebras et al. 2003, Johnston et al. 2005, Chung et al. 2006, Farr et al. 2006, Than et al. 2008). However, biological and genetic relationships within the broad C. gloeosporioides clade remain confused and ITS sequences alone are insufficient to resolve them.

In this study we define the limits of the C. gloeosporioides species complex on the basis of ITS sequences, the species we accept within the complex forming a strongly supported clade in the ITS gene tree (fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). In all cases the taxa we include in the C. gloeosporioides complex would fit within the traditional morphological concept of the C. gloeosporioides group (e.g. von Arx 1970, Mordue 1971, and Sutton 1980). Commonly used species names within the C. gloeosporioides complex include C. fragariae, C. musae, and C. kahawae. Since the epitype paper (Cannon et al. 2008), several new C. gloeosporioides-like species have been described in regional studies, where multi-gene analyses have shown the new species to be phylogenetically distinct from the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Rojas et al. 2010, Phoulivong et al. 2011,  and Wikee et al. 2011). The regional nature of most of these studies, the often restricted genetic sampling across the diversity of C. gloeosporioides globally, and the minimal overlap between isolates treated and gene regions targeted in the various studies, means that the relationship between the newly described species is often poorly understood. While some authors have embraced a genetically highly restricted concept for C. gloeosporioides, many applied researchers continue to use the name in a broad, group-species concept (e.g. Bogo et al. 2012, Deng et al. 2012, Kenny et al. 2012, Parvin et al. 2012, and Zhang et al. 2012). In this paper we accept both concepts as useful and valid. When used in a broad sense, we refer to the taxon as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat.

This paper aims to clarify the genetic and taxonomic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides species complex using a set of isolates that widely samples its genetic, biological and geographic diversity. Type specimens, or cultures derived from type specimens, have been examined wherever possible. Although we do not treat all of the names placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970), we treat all names for which a possible close relationship with C. gloeosporioides has been suggested in the recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata. ITS sequences, the official barcoding gene for fungi (Seifert 2009, Schoch et al. 2012), do not reliably resolve relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. We define species in the complex genetically rather than morphologically, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses of up to eight genes. Following Cannon et al. (2012, this issue) the generic name Colletotrichum is used as the preferred generic name for all species wherever possible throughout this paper, whether or not a Glomerella state has been observed for that fungus, and whether or not the Glomerella state has a formal name.

MATERIALS AND METHODSSpecimen isolation and selectionAn attempt was made to sample the genetic diversity across C. gloeosporioides as widely as possible, with isolates from diverse hosts from around the world selected for more intensive study. A BLAST search of GenBank using the ITS sequence of the epitype culture of C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al. 2008) provided a coarse estimate for the genetic limit of the C. gloeosporioides complex and ITS diversity across the complex was used to select a genetically diverse set of isolates. Voucher cultures were obtained from the research groups who deposited the GenBank records. To these were added isolates representing the known genetic and morphological diversity of C. gloeosporioides from New Zealand, isolated from rots of native and introduced fruits, from diseased exotic weeds, and as endophytes from leaves of native podocarps. Additional isolates representing ex-type and authentic cultures of as many named taxa and formae speciales within the C. gloeosporioides complex as possible were obtained from international culture collections. Approximately 400 isolates belonging to the C. gloeosporioides complex were obtained. GAPDH gene sequences were generated for all isolates as an initial measure of genetic diversity. A subset of 156 isolates, selected to represent the range of genetic, geographic, and host plant diversity, was used in this research (Table 1).

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex117Most of the New Zealand isolates had been stored as conidial suspensions made from single conidium or ascospore cultures and then stored at -80 °C in a 5 % glycerol/water suspension. Additional isolates from New Zealand were obtained from the ICMP culture collection, where isolates are stored as lyophilised (freeze-dried) ampoules or in a metabolically inactive state in liquid nitrogen at -196 °C. The storage history of most of the isolates received from other research groups is not known. Table 1 lists the isolates studied. All those supplying cultures are acknowledged at the end of this manuscript, and additional details on each culture are available on the ICMP website (http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/resources/collections/icmp).

DNA extraction, amplification, and sequencingMycelium was collected from isolates grown on PDA agar, and manually comminuted with a micropestle in 420 μL of Quiagen DXT tissue digest buffer; 4.2 μL of proteinase K was added and incubated at 55 °C for 1 h. After a brief centrifugation 220 μL of the supernatant was placed in a Corbett X-tractorGene automated nucleic acid extraction robot. The resulting 100 μL of pure DNA in TE buffer was stored at -30 °C in 1.5 mL tubes until use.

Gene sequences were obtained from eight nuclear gene regions, actin (ACT) [316 bp], calmodulin (CAL) [756 bp], chitin synthase (CHS-1) [229 bp], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [308 bp], the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) [615 bp], glutamine synthetase (GS) [907 bp], manganesesuperoxide dismutase (SOD2) [376 bp], and β-tubulin 2 (TUB2) [716 bp].

PCR Primers used during this study are shown in Table 2. The standard CAL primers (O’Donnell et al. 2000) gave poor or non-specific amplification for most isolates, thus new primers (CL1C, CL2C) were designed for Colletotrichum based on the C. graminicola M1.001 genome sequence. The standard GS primers (Stephenson et al. 1997) sequenced poorly for some isolates due to an approx. 9 bp homopolymer T run 71 bp in from the end of the GSF1 primer binding site. A new primer, GSF3, was designed 41 bp downstream of this region to eliminate the homopolymer slippage error from sequencing. The reverse primer GSR2 was designed in the same location as GSR1 with one nucleotide change. Both new GS primers were based on similarity with a C. theobromicola UQ62 sequence (GenBank L78067, as C. gloeosporioides).

The PCRs were performed in an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 25 μL. The PCR mixtures contained 15.8 μL of UV-sterilised ultra-filtered water, 2.5 μL of 10× PCR buffer (with 20 mM MgCl2), 2.5 μL of dNTPs (each 20 μM), 1 μL of each primer (10 μM), 1 μL of BSA, 1 μL of genomic DNA, and 0.2 μL (1 U) of Roche FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase.The PCR conditions for ITS were 4 min at 95 °C, then 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52 °C for 30 s, 72 °C for 45 s, and then 7 min at 72 °C. The annealing temperatures differed for the other genes, with the optimum for each; ACT: 58 °C, CAL: 59 °C, CHS1: 58 °C, GAPDH: 60 °C, GS: 54 °C, SOD2: 54 °C, TUB2: 55 °C. Some isolates required altered temperatures and occasionally gave multiple bands, which were excised separately from an electrophoresis gel and purified. PCR Products were purified on a Qiagen MinElute 96 UF PCR Purification Plate.DNA sequences were obtained in both directions on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Avant Genetic analyzer using BigDye v. 3.1 chemistry, electropherograms were analysed and assembled in Sequencher v. 4.10.1 (Gene Codes Corp.). Phylogenetic analysesMultiple sequence alignments of each gene were made with ClustalX v. 2.1 (Larkin et al. 2007), and manually adjusted where necessary with Geneious Pro v. 5.5.6 (Drummond et al. 2011).

Bayesian inference (BI) was used to reconstruct most of the phylogenies using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al. 2012). Bayesian inference has significant advantages over other methods of analysis such as maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony (Archibald et al. 2003) and provides measures of clade support as posterior probabilities rather than random resampling bootstraps. jModelTest v. 0.1.1 (Posada 2008) was used to carry out statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution using the corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) (Table 3). Initial analyses showed that individual genes were broadly congruent, thus nucleotide alignments of all genes were concatenated using Geneious, and separate partitions created for each gene with their own model of nucleotide substitution. Analyses on the full data set were run twice for 5 x 107 generations, and twice for 2 x 107 generations for the clade trees. Samples were taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. Convergence of all parameters was checked using the internal diagnostics of the standard deviation of split frequencies and performance scale reduction factors (PSRF), and then externally with Tracer v. 1.5 (Rambaut & Drummond 2007). On this basis the first 25 % of generations were discarded as burn-in.

An initial BI analysis treated all 158 isolates using a concatenated alignment for five of the genes, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS. Colletotrichum boninense and C. hippeastri were used as outgroups. A second BI analysis, restricted to ex-type or authentic isolates of each of the accepted species, was based on a concatenated alignment of all eight genes. A third set of BI analyses treated focussed on taxa within the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade. For each clade, the ex-type or authentic isolates, together with 2–3 additional selected isolates of each accepted taxon where available, were analysed using a concatenated alignment of all eight genes, with C. gloeosporioides used as the outgroup for both analyses.

Several species-trees analyses were conducted using BEAST v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012). Species-trees combine multi-gene and multiple isolate data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hypothesised species, rather than individual isolates. BEAST does not use concatenation, but rather co-estimates the individual gene trees embedded inside the summary species tree. It also estimates the time since each species shared a common ancestor (divergence times). For these analyses the species tree ancestral reconstruction option was selected (Heled & Drummond 2010), the gene data partitioned as for BI and the substitution model for each gene was selected based on the models selected using jModelTest. The individual isolates were grouped into sets of species by setting species names as trait values. A strict clock was used for the GAPDH gene (as an all intronic sequence it was assumed to be accumulating mutations at a steady rate) and the other gene clock rates were estimated relative to GAPDH, using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock. The species tree prior used for all genes was the Yule process, with the ploidy type set to nuclear autosomal. Uninformative priors were used for all parameters, and were allowed to auto optimise.

The first species-tree analysis was conducted using the 158 isolate, five gene dataset, with C. boninense and C. hippeastri as the outgroups. The MCMC chain was set to 1 × 108 generations for the species complex tree and samples were taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. The analysis was run twice independently. The effective sample size (ESS) and traces of all parameters and convergence of the two runs was checked with Tracer and a summary maximum clade credibility species tree was built with TreeAnnotator v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012) using a 10 % burn-in and a posterior probability limit of 0.5, setting the heights of each node in the tree to the mean height across the entire sample of trees for that clade. Separate analyses were conducted using all eight genes and the same restricted set of isolates chosen to represent taxa within the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade as were used for the BI analyses of the eight gene concatenated analyses outlined above. For each of the Musae and Kahawae clade analyses, the MCMC chain was set to 5 × 107 generations, but otherwise run as for the five gene dataset.

To illustrate the potential limitations of ITS to discriminate species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, an UPGMA tree was built of all 158 ITS sequences, using the Geneious tree builder tool. A UPGMA tree visually approximates a BLAST search, which is based on distances (and sequence length) rather than corrected nucleotide substitutions of more sophisticated, model-based analyses. Sequences derived in this study were lodged in GenBank (Table 1), the concatenated alignment and trees in TreeBASE (www.

treebase.org) study number S12535, and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004).

Morphology Detailed morphological descriptions are provided only for those species with no recently published description. Few specimens were examined from infected host material; the descriptions provided are mostly from agar cultures. Cultures were grown on Difco PDA from single conidia, or from single hyphal tips for the few specimens where no conidia were formed, with culture diameter measured and appearance described after 10 d growth at 18–20 oC under mixed white and UV fluorescent tubes, 12 h light/12 h dark. Colour codes follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1963). Weir et al.

124Conidia were measured and described using conidia taken from the conidial ooze on acervuli and mounted in lactic acid, at least 24 conidia were measured for each isolate, range measurements are provided in the form (lower extreme–) 25 % quartile – 75 % quartile (–upper extreme), all ranges were rounded to the nearest 0.5 µm. Cultures were examined periodically for the development of perithecia. Ascospores were measured and described from perithecia crushed in lactic acid.

Appressoria were producing using a slide culture technique. A small square of agar was inoculated on one side with conidia and immediately covered with a sterile cover slip. After 14 d the cover slip was removed and placed in a drop of lactic acid on a glass slide. All morphological character measurements were analysed with the statistical programme “R” v. 2.14.0 (R Development Core Team 2011). The R package ggplot2 (Wickham 2009) was used for graphical plots. The box plots show the median, upper and lower quartiles, and the ‘whisker’ extends to the outlying data, or to a maximum of 1.5× the interquartile range, individual outliers outside this range are shown as dots.

Taxa treated in the taxonomic sectionSpecies, subspecific taxa, and formae speciales within the C. gloeosporioides species complex are treated alphabetically by epithet. The names of formae speciales are not governed by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) (McNeill et al. 2006, Art. 4, Note 4), and are hence enclosed in quotation marks to indicate their invalid status. Other invalid names that are governed by the ICBN are also enclosed in quotation marks. Accepted names are marked with an asterisk (*). The breadth of the taxonomic names treated includes:all taxonomic names with DNA sequence data in GenBank that place them in the C. gloeosporioides complex as it has been defined here on the basis of the ITS gene tree. The sense that the names were used in GenBank may have been misapplied; names that have been used in the literature in recent years for which a possible relationship to C. gloeosporioides has been suggested; all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata.

We have not considered the full set of species in Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium and Glomerella that were placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954) or von Arx (1957, 1970). For each accepted species, comments are provided regarding the limitations of ITS, the official barcoding gene for fungi, to distinguish that species from others within the C. gloeosporioides complex.

The gene boundaries in the alignment were: ACT: 1–316, CAL: 317–1072, CHS-1: 1073–1371, GAPDH: 1372–1679, ITS: 1680–2294. A BI analysis of the concatenated dataset is presented in Fig.1. This tree is annotated with the species boundaries of the taxa that we accept in the C. gloeosporioides complex, and the clades representing these taxa formed the basis for investigating the morphological and biological diversity of our species. Ex-type and authentic isolates are highlighted in bold and labelled with the names under which they were originally described. The posterior probability (PP) support for the grouping of most species ranges from 1 to 0.96, however support for deeper nodes is often lower, e.g. 0.53 for the root of C. ti and C. aotearoa, indicating that the branching may be uncertain for the root of these species. Branch lengths and node PP are typically lower within a species than between species. The large number of taxa in Fig. 1 makes it difficult to visualise the interspecific genetic distance between the recognised species. The unrooted tree in Fig. 2 represents the results of a BI analysis based on a concatenation of all eight genes, but restricted to the ex-type or authentic cultures from each of the accepted taxa. The analysis was done without out-group taxa and clearly shows two clusters of closely related species that we informally label the Musae clade, and the Kahawae clade.

To better resolve relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades a further set of BI analyses included eight genes and, wherever possible, several representative isolates of each of the accepted species. All eight gene sequences were concatenated to form a supermatrix for each clade. For the Musae clade of 32 isolates the alignment was 4199 bp and the gene boundaries were: ACT: 1–292, TUB2: 293–1008, CAL: 1009–1746, CHS-1: 1747–2045, GAPDH: 2046–2331, GS: 2332–3238, ITS: 3239–3823, SOD2: 3824–4199. For the Kahawae clade of 30 isolates the alignment was 4107 bp and the gene boundaries were: ACT: 1–281, TUB2: 282–988, CAL: 989–1728, CHS-1: 1729–2027, GAPDH: 2028–2311, GS: 2312–3179, ITS: 3198–3733, SOD2: 3734–4107. The additional genes sequenced provided additional support for our initial species delimitations with better resolution for some closely related species. For example, the highly pathogenic coffee berry isolates (referred to here as C. kahawae subsp. kahawae) were distinguished from other C. kahawae isolates. Analyses based on concatenated data sets can mask incongruence between individual gene trees. The low levels of support within some parts of the species-tree analysis (Fig. 3), in part reflects incongruence between gene trees. The levels of support for the Kahawae clade and for the Musae clade are strong (PP=1) but the species that we accept within these clades have lower levels of support than is shown between the other species outside of the clades. The scale bar in Fig. 3 represents a time scale, calibrated at zero for the present day, and at 1 for the last common ancestor (LCA) of the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes. The separate species-tree analyses for the Musae and Kahawae clades provide a finer resolution of evolutionary history within each clade, the time scale based on the same calibration as Fig. 3.

The UPGMA-based ITS gene tree (Fig 6). shows that C. theobromicola, C. horii, C. gloeosporioides, G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”, C. asianum, C. musae, C. alatae, C. xanthorrhoeae all form monophyletic clades and may be distinguished with ITS, but many species are unable to be discriminated using this gene alone. Note that C. cordylinicola and C. psidii are represented by a single isolate, meaning that variation within ITS sequences across these species has not been tested.

Morphology and biologyBrief morphological descriptions, based on all specimens examined, are provided for only those species with no recently published description. Conidial sizes for all accepted species are summarised in Fig. 7. Within a species, conidial sizes are reasonably consistent across isolates, independent of geographic origin or host. However, differences between species are often slight and size ranges often overlap (Fig. 7). The shape of appressoria is generally consistent within a species, some being simple in outline, others complex and highly lobed.

Several species are characterised in part by the development of perithecia in culture. These include four species in the Musae clade (C. alienum, C. fructicola, C. queenslandicum, and C. salsolae) and three in the Kahawae clade (C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. ti). Ascospore size and shape can be a useful species-level diagnostic feature (Fig. 8). In most species the ascospores are strongly curved and typically tapering towards the ends, but in C. clidemiae and C. ti, they are more or less elliptic with broadly rounded ends and not, or only slightly, curved. Individual isolates within any of these species may lose the ability to form perithecia, perhaps associated with cultural changes during storage.

Large, dark-walled stromatic structures are present in the cultures of some species not known to form perithecia. Often embedded in agar, less commonly on the surface or amongst the aerial mycelium, these structures differ from perithecia in comprising a compact tissue of tightly tangled hyphae rather than the pseudoparenchymatous, angular cells typical of perithecial walls. They have a soft, leathery texture compared to the more brittle perithecia. These stromatic structures sometimes develop a conidiogenous layer internally, and following the production of conidia they may split open irregularly, folding back to form a stromatic, acervulus-like structure. These kind of structures are also formed by some species in the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue).

The macroscopic appearance of the cultures is often highly divergent within a species (e.g. C. fructicola and C. theobromicola), in most cases probably reflecting different storage histories of the isolates examined. Prolonged storage, especially with repeated subculturing, results in staling of the cultures, the aerial mycelium often becoming dense and uniform in appearance and colour, and a loss of conidial and perithecial production, and variable in growth rate (Fig. 9). In some species, individual single ascospore or single conidial isolates show two markedly different cultural types, see notes under C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. Some species appear to be host specialised, e.g. C. horii, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, C. nupharicola, C. salsolae, C. ti, and C. xanthorrhoeae, but those most commonly isolated have broad host and geographic ranges, e.g. C. fructicola, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s. str. is commonly isolated from Citrus in many Weir et al.

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex127parts of the world, but has been isolated from other hosts as well, such as Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis. Not all of the species with a broad host range are found everywhere, for example in New Zealand C. alienum is commonly associated with cultivated fruits, whereas species such as C. siamense and C. fructicola, common on these same cultivated fruits in other parts of the world, have not been reported from New Zealand. Taxonomy Based on results of the multigene concatenated BI phylogenies, we accept 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Isolates authentic for G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” form a genetically distinct group, but this is not formally named because of doubts over its relationship to C. camelliae. Based on DNA sequence comparisons, a few other isolates almost certainly represent additional unnamed species. We do not formally describe them because most are known from a single isolate, often stale, with little understanding of either their morphological or biological diversity. In the Musae clade these include ICMP 18614 and ICMP 18616, both from grape from Japan, and ICMP 18726 from pawpaw from the Cook Islands, and in the Kahawae clade ICMP 18699 from chestnut from Japan.

but DNA sequences from these isolates have been accessioned into GenBank (ITS: JX009423–JX009428, GAPDH: JX009416–JX009422, ACT: JX009404–JX009407, CAL: JX009408–JX009411, CHS-1: JX009412–JX009415).Many of the species that we recognise fall into one of two clades, the informally named Musae clade and Kahawae clade (Fig. 2). Each clade contains several species that are phylogenetically well supported in multi-gene analyses, but within the clades branch lengths are short because of the small number of phylogenetically informative characters. This is reflected in the low support values in the gene tree analyses for the species we accept within that clade (Figs 3, 4). Both the Musae and Kahawae clades contain ex-type or authentic cultures from several long accepted species. In this work we have made a pragmatic decision to minimise taxonomic disruption, so that monophyletic subclades within the Kahawae and Musae clades are accepted as species where they include Weir et al.

130ex-type or authentic cultures. The Musae clade thus includes C. fructicola, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale; and the Kahawae clade includes C. cordylinicola, C. psidii, and C. kahawae. Also belonging in the latter is Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”. To provide a consistent taxonomic treatment of the subclades resolved within the Musae and Kahawae clades, several new species and one new subspecies are proposed. In the Musae clade these are C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum, C. queenslandicum, and C. salsolae; in the Kahawae clade C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. ti. The other accepted species, well resolved in all of the gene trees, are C. alatae, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. theobromicola, and C. xanthorrhoeae. 0.0040ICMP 17821 Citrus ItalyC. gloeosporioidesICMP 18535 New ZealandDacrycarpusICMP 4832 New ZealandC. ti CordylineICMP 18537 New ZealandC. aotearoa CoprosmaICMP 17816 KenyaC. kahawae CoffeaICMP 10646 Camellia USAICMP 18532 New ZealandVitexICMP 18548 New ZealandCoprosmaICMP 19120 ItalyC. psidii PsidiumICMP 18542 USACamelliaICMP 18740 New ZealandDysoxylumICMP 18579 ThailandC. cordylinicola CordylineICMP 19122 Vaccinium USAG. rufomaculans var. vacciniiICMP 18706 USAVitisICMP 17922  GermanyG. c. var.  migrans HypericumICMP 17324 New ZealandKunzeaICMP 5285 New ZealandCordylineICMP 18658 USAC. gloeosporioides “f. sp.clidemia” ClidemiaICMP 18530 New ZealandVitexICMP 17915 AngolaCoffeaICMP 17811 MalawiCoffeaICMP 17326 New ZealandPodocarpusICMP 18735 New ZealandHedychiumICMP 17905 CameroonCoffeaICMP 12952 New ZealandPerseaICMP 18577 New ZealandCoprosmaICMP 18539 C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro AustraliaOleaICMP 10643 Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” Camellia UKICMP 18534 New ZealandKunzeaICMP 17931 SwitzerlandDryasICMP 18533 New ZealandPrumnopitys0.8911110.990.5611110.950.990.5810.990.9810.940.89110.9810.621C. gloeosporioidesC. kahawae ciggarosubsp.

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex135* Colletotrichum aenigma B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563759. Fig. 10. Etymology: from the Latin aenigma, based on the enigmatic biological and geographic distribution of this species. Holotype: Israel, on Persea americana, coll. S. Freeman Avo-374B, PDD 102233; ex-holotype culture ICMP 18608. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 30–35 mm diam after 10 d. Aerial mycelium sparse, cottony, white, surface of agar uniformly pale orange (7A5) towards centre, more or less colourless towards edge, conidia not associated with well differentiated acervuli and no masses of conidial ooze. In reverse pale orange towards centre. Conidiogenous cells arising haphazardly from dense, tangled hyphae across agar surface, short-cylindric with a poorly differentiated conidiogenous locus. Conidia often germinating soon after release, sometimes forming appressoria, so forming a thin, compact, layer of germinated, septate conidia, germ tubes, and appressoria across the central part of the colony surface. Conidia (12–)14–15(–16.5) × (5–)6–6.5(–7.5) µm (av. 14.5 × 6.1 µm, n = 53), cylindric with broadly rounded ends. Appressoria 6–10 µm diam, subglobose or with a few broad lobes. Geographic distribution and host range: known from only two collections, one from Pyrus pyrifolia from Japan, the other from Persea americana from Israel. Genetic identification: ITS sequences are insufficient to separate C. aenigma from C. alienum and some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using TUB2 or GS. Notes: Although the biology of this species is more or less unknown, it has been found in two widely separate regions and is, therefore, likely to be found to be geographically widespread in the future. Genetically distinct within the Musae clade, this species has a distinctive appearance in culture with sparse, pale aerial mycelium and lacking differentiated acervuli. Other specimen examined: Japan, on Pyrus pyrifolia, coll. H. Ishii Nashi-10 (ICMP 18686). * Colletotrichum aeschynomenes B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563590. Fig. 11.

= C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” (Daniel et al. 1973, as aeschynomene).

Etymology: Based on C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes”, referring to the host from which this species was originally described. Holotype: USA, Arkansas, on Aeschynomene virginica stem lesion, coll. D. TeBeest 3-1-3, PDD 101995; ex-type culture ICMP 17673 = ATCC 201874. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 25–35 mm diam after 10 d, aerial mycelium sparse, cottony, white, surface of colony with numerous acervuli, some with dark bases, with orange conidial ooze; in reverse more or less colourless apart from the dark acervuli and orange conidial masses showing through the agar. Conidia (14–)17–18.5(–20) × 4(–5) µm (av. 17.6 × 4.1 µm, n = 30), cylindric, straight, tapering slightly near both ends. Appressoria mostly elliptic to subfusoid, deeply lobed. Perithecia not seen. Geographic distribution and host range: Reported only from USA, pathogenic to Aeschynomeme. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not distinguish C. aeschynomenes from C. fructicola. These taxa are best distinguished using TUB2, GAPDH, or GS. Notes: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” has been used to refer to isolates pathogenic to Aeschynomene virginica, later developed as the weed biocontrol agent Collego (references in Ditmore et al. 2008). It has also been reported from a range of other hosts (TeBeest 1988). Our analyses, based on a single, authentic strain of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” (TeBeest 3.1.3, apparently the source of the single spore isolate originally used in the development of Collego, Ditmore et al. (2008)) show it to be genetically distinct within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Genetically close to the geographically and biologically diverse C. siamense, it differs morphologically from this species in having slightly longer and narrower conidia which taper slightly toward the ends, and in having larger, strongly lobed appressoria. An isolate deposited as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes in CBS (CBS 796.72) by G.E. Templeton, one of the early C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes researchers (Daniel et al. 1973), is genetically distinct to TeBeest 3.1.3 and has been identified by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue) as C. godetiae, a member of the C. acutatum complex. The strain that we examined (Te Beest 3.1.3) matches genetically another strain often cited in the C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes literature (Clar5a = ATCC 96723) (GenBank JX131331). It is possible that two distinct species, both highly pathogenic to Aeschynomene in Arkansas, have been confused. A survey of additional isolates of Colletotrichum highly virulent to Aeschynomene in Arkansas would clarify the interpretation of the past literature on this pathogen. For example, C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” was initially reported as specific to Aeschynomene virginica (Daniel et al. 1973), while later studies reported isolates putatively of the same taxon, to have a wider host range (TeBeest 1988). Cisar et al. (1994) reported fertile ascospores from crosses between isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” and isolates of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae”, a pathogen of Jussiaea decurrens. The position of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” within our phylogeny is not known, but these taxa could prove useful for better understanding of the biological differences between phylogenetically defined species of Colletotrichum. Specimen examined: USA, Arkansas, on Aeschynomene virginica stem lesion, coll. D. TeBeest 3.1.3 (ICMP 17673 = ATCC 201874).

Scale bar of B applies to B–E. www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex139Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from yam (Dioscorea alata), from Nigeria, Barbardos, India, Guadeloupe. Genetic identification: ITS sequences distinguish C. alatae from all other taxa. Notes: Anthracnose diseases of yam are found throughout the regions where the host is grown (e.g. Winch et al. 1984, Prasad & Singh 1960, Singh et al. 1966, Abang et al. 2002, 2003). Isolates from diseased yam leaves are morphologically (Winch et al. 1984) and genetically (Abang et al. 2002) diverse. Both of these authors used a broad species concept, grouping all isolates sourced from yam under the single name C. gloeosporioides. In this paper we accept part of that diversity to represent a distinct species, newly described here as C. alatae. The type specimen of C. alatae matches the SGG (slow growing grey) group of Abang et al. (2002), the group that these authors found to be more pathogenic to yam than the other morphological and genetic groups they recognised within C. gloeosporioides. In addition to the Nigerian isolates of Abang et al. (2002), isolates from yam from Barbados (isolates SAS8 and SAS9 from Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996), Guadeloupe (GenBank accession GQ495617) and India (CBS 304.67 and GenBank accession FJ940734) belong in this clade, while no isolates from other hosts have been found. Other isolates from yam that we sequenced included some representing the Abang et al. (2002) FGS group (Abang Cg22 = ICMP 18120, Abang Cg13 = ICMP 18125, Abang CgS6 = ICMP 18117, Abang CgS2 = ICMP 18121), a group distinguished from the highly pathogenic SGG isolates by faster growth in culture and shorter conidia (Abang et al. 2002). Two of these isolates (ICMP 18120, 18125) genetically match C. fructicola, the others match C. siamense. Several names have been applied to Colletotrichum specimens from anthracnose of yam stems and leaves, including Gloeosporium pestis Massee, G. “dioscoreae” Sawada (nom. inval.; no Latin diagnosis), Colletotrichum dioscoreae Av.-Saccá 1917, and C. dioscoreae Tehon 1933. In addition, Gloeosporium bomplandii Speg. was described from a host doubtfully identified as Dioscorea. Because of the broad genetic diversity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with diseased yam, the lack of cultures from any of these early type specimens, and the uncertainty to which part of the yam-associated diversity they correspond, we have chosen not to use these names for our newly recognised, yam-specialised pathogen. Whether the postharvest tuber rot referred to as dead skin disease of yam (Abang et al. 2003, Green & Simmons 1994) is caused by the same Colletotrichum population as associated with diseased foliage is not known. Other specimen examined: Nigeria, Kpite, on Dioscorea alata leaf, coll. M.M. Abang Cg25, 2001 (ICMP 18122). * Colletotrichum alienum B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563591. Figs 13, 14.

Etymology: Based on the biology of this species, confined to exotic hosts and presumed to be a recent introduction to Australasia.Holotype: New Zealand, Auckland, Kumeu research orchard, Malus domestica fruit rot, coll. P.R. Johnston C824, 14 Aug. 1987, PDD 101996; ex-type culture ICMP 12071.

Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 85 mm diam after 10 d. Colonies often with distinct sectors; some with cottony, grey aerial mycelium with numerous dark-based acervuli and orange conidial ooze visible through the mycelium; others with dense, cottony to felted mycelium, fewer acervuli and these hidden by the dense mycelium. In reverse, irregular dark grey patches and sectors masking the pale orange coloured pigmentation. ICMP 18691 looks “stale” with slow growth, dense, pale aerial mycelium and sparse conidial production and no perithecia. Conidia (12.5–) 15.5–17.5(–22) × (3–)5–5.5(–6) µm (av. 16.5 × 5.0 µm, n = 70), cylindric with broadly rounded ends. Appressoria mostly simple, globose to short-cylindric, a few with broad, irregular lobes; ICMP 18691 has mostly lobed appressoria. Perithecia forming in most cultures after about 10 d, dark-walled, globose with short, narrow ostiolar neck. Ascospores (14.5–)17–19.5(–22) × 4–5(–6) µm (av. 18.1 × 4.6 µm, n = 55), cylindric, curved, tapering slightly to each end. Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Australia and New Zealand, common on a wide range of introduced fruit crops. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. alienum from some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using CAL or GS. Notes: Common on commercial fruit crops, this fungus was referred to as C. gloeosporioides Group A by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005).

Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 70–85 mm diam after 10 d, several isolates with restricted growth, 50–55 mm diam with an irregularly scalloped margin. Aerial mycelium cottony to dense cottony, tufted near centre, grey to dark grey, scattered, small, dark-based acervuli and large, globose, stromatic structures partially embedded in agar, these sometimes splitting apart and forming conidia. In reverse typically with pinkish-orange pigments, variable in intensity, in some isolates this colour partially hidden by more or less concentric bands of dark grey pigment. Conidia (12–)16–17.5(–21.5) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6.5) µm (av. 16.9 × 5.2 µm, n = 216), cylindric, straight, apex broadly rounded, often tapering slightly towards subtruncate base, 0-septate, hyaline.

Perithecia not seen in culture. Geographic distribution and host range: Confirmed only from New Zealand, but GenBank records suggest C. aotearoa also occurs in China (see below). In New Zealand this species is common on a taxonomically diverse set of native plants, as both a fruit rot and a leaf endophyte, and has also been isolated from leaves of several species of naturalised weeds. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. aotearoa from several taxa in the Kahawae and Musae clades. This species can be distinguished using several other genes, including TUB2, CAL, GS, and GAPDH. Notes: All isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex from New Zealand native plants studied here belong in the Kahawae clade, and most of these are C. aotearoa; a small number of leaf endophyte isolates from New Zealand native trees are C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. The C. aotearoa isolates have been isolated as endophytes from symptomless leaves as well as from rotting fruit from native trees. Morphologically indistinguishable from isolates of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, this species is distinguished genetically with all genes sampled, except ITS. The GAPDH gene tree splits C. aotearoa into two well supported clades, but these do not correlate to any other features, either geographic or biological. Isolates associated with distinctive and common leaf spots on Meryta sinclairii, first recorded by Beever (1984), belong in this species. Whether isolates of C. aotearoa from other hosts are able to cause the same disease on Meryta is not known. Also in C. aotearoa are a range of isolates from weeds that have become naturalised in New Zealand. We assume that C. aotearoa is a New Zealand native species. It has a broad host range amongst native plants and has apparently jumped host to some weeds. It has never been found associated with cultivated plants or as a rot of cultivated fruit. Colletotrichum aotearoa may also occur in China. ITS sequences from isolates from Boehmeria from China (GenBank records GQ120479 and GQ120480) from Wang et al. (2010) match exactly a set of C. aotearoa isolates. ITS between-species differences within the C. gloeosporioides complex are very small, so this match needs confirming with additional genes.

(2009) provide a description of this species. Geographic distribution and host range: Known on Mangifera indica from Australia, Colombia, Japan, Panama, Philippines, and Thailand; also reported on Coffea arabica from Thailand. Genetic identification: Colletotrichum asianum is distinguished from all other taxa using any of the genes tested, including ITS. Notes: Although the type specimen is from coffee, this fungus is isolated commonly from mango (Mangifera indica) (e.g. Morphological Group 1 from Than et al. 2008; IMI 313839 from Australia; MAFF 306627 from Japan). Isolates referred to Colletotrichum indet. sp. 1 by Rojas et al. (2010), also associated with mango fruit rots, again match C. asianum. Based on ITS sequences, isolates Man-63 and Man-69 cited by Afanador-Kafuri et al. (2003) from mango from Colombia, are probably also C. asianum. Several papers have reported genetically uniform populations of C. gloeosporioides associated with M. indica around the world (e.g. Hodson et al. 1993, Alahakoon et al. 1994, Sanders & Korsten 2003) and these perhaps also represent C. asianum, although DNA sequences are not available to confirm this.

As with most substrates, several different species of Colletotrichum often occur on the same host. Fig. 16. Colletotrichum aotearoa. A. ICMP 18537 – ex-holotype culture. B. ICMP 18548. C. ICMP 18532.

144For example, Damm et al. (2012a, b, this issue) report members of the C. acutatum and C. boninense species complexes, C. simmondsii, C. fioriniae, and C. karstii, from mango from Australia. Isolates from Capsicum reported by Than et al. (2008) as C. gloeosporioides Morphological Group 2 (e.g. isolates Ku4 = ICMP 18575 and Ku8 = ICMP 18618), were referred to as C. asianum by Hyde et al. (2009), however they are genetically distinct from C. asianum and belong to C. siamense based on our analyses.

Notes: Sawada (1922) provided an English translation of his original description. This species was described as a stem pathogen of Boehmeria nivea, and remains in use in this sense (e.g. Li & Ma 1993). Wang et al. (2010) cite several GenBank accessions from isolates they identify as C. gloeosporioides that cause severe disease of Boehmeria. Based on a comparison of the GenBank data with our ITS gene tree, these and other isolates from the same host deposited by the same authors (GQ120479–GQ120499), appear to represent three different taxa within the C. gloeosporioides complex — C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. aotearoa, and C. fructicola. Isolates representative of all three taxa are reportedly pathogenic on Boehmeria (Wang et al. 2010). The genetic relationship of these fungi needs to be confirmed using additional genes. Colletotrichum camelliae Massee, Bull. Misc. Inform. Kew. 1899: 91. 1899. Notes: Colletotrichum camelliae was described by Massee (in Willis 1899) from the living leaves of tea (Camellia sinensis) from Sri Lanka. It was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Although not listed by Hyde et al. (2009), the name is widely used in the trade and semi-popular literature as the causal agent of the brown blight disease of tea (e.g. Sosa de Castro et al. 2001, Muraleedharan & Baby 2007). We have been unable to sample Colletotrichum isolates from tea with typical brown blight symptoms. There are four GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from tea, two from China (EU732732, FJ515007), one from Japan (AB218993), and another from Iran (AB548281), referred variously to C. camelliae, C. crassipes and C. gloeosporioides. Although ITS sequences only are available for these geographically widespread isolates, the DNA sequence of the Iranian isolate appears to match C. gloeosporioides s. str., while those from the other three isolates are all very similar to each other. The ITS sequence from these isolates matches that of CBS 232.79, from tea shoots from Java (GenBank JX009429). GAPDH and ITS sequences from CBS 232.79 (GenBank JX009417, JX009429) place this isolate in C. fructicola. Note that CBS 571.88, isolated from tea from China and deposited as Glomerella cingulata, is a Colletotrichum sp. outside C. gloeosporioides s. lat., based on ITS sequences (GenBank JX009424). We tested the pathogenicity of CBS 232.79 and isolates of G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” (see below) using detached tea leaves and found that only the G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” isolates were strong pathogens (unpubl. data).

The genetic relationship between the pathogen of ornamental Camellia (here referred to G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”), isolates from tea with DNA sequence data in GenBank, and isolates associated with brown blight symptoms of tea remain unresolved. Additional isolates with known pathogenicity, collected from typical brown blight symptoms from the field, are required to determine whether or not there are two distinct pathogens of Camellia, one of tea, the other of ornamental varieties.

Other Colletotrichum species reported from tea include C. “theae-sinensis”, an invalid recombination of Gloeosporium theaesinensis I. Miyake, proposed by Yamamoto (1960). Moriwaki and Sato (2009) summarised the taxonomic history of this name and transferred G. theae-sinensis to Discula on the basis of DNA sequences. Sphaerella camelliae Cooke and its recombination Laestadia camelliae (Cooke) Berl. & Voglino were listed by von Arx & Müller (1954) as synonyms of Glomerella cingulata. This species is now accepted as Guignardia camelliae (Cooke) E.J. Butler ex Petch and is regarded as the causal agent of copper blight disease of tea (Spaulding 1958).

Thang (2008) placed C. camelliae in synonymy with C. coccodes, presumably on the basis of the Species Fungorum synonymy (www.speciesfungorum.org, website viewed 6 Oct 2010). Thang (2008) questioned the synonymy, noting differences between the descriptions of the two species provided by Massee (in Willis 1899) and Sutton (1980) respectively.

Colletotrichum caricae F. Stevens & J.G. Hall, Z. Pflanzenkrankh., 19: 68. 1909.

Notes: Placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957), C. caricae was listed as a separate species by Sutton (1992). It was described from fruits and leaves of Ficus carica from the USA (Stevens & Hall 1909) but is poorly understood both morphologically and biologically. Its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, and to other Ficus-associated species such as Colletotrichum ficus Koord. and Glomerella cingulata var. minor (here placed in synonymy with C. fructicola) is unknown.

= Gloeosporium cingulatum G.F. Atk., Bull. Cornell Univ. Agric. Exp. Sta. 49: 306. 1892. [fide Stoneman 1898]Notes: Stoneman (1898) described Glomerella cingulata from diseased stems of Ligustrum vulgare from the USA and reported the development of perithecia in cultures initiated from conidia of what she considered its asexual morph, Gloeosporium cingulatum. There are recent reports of anthracnose diseases of Ligustrum (e.g. Alfieri et al. 1984, Vajna & Bagyinka 2002) but the relationship of isolates causing this disease to the C. gloeosporioides complex is not known. Glomerella cingulata is often linked taxonomically to the anamorph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and the name has in the past been applied in an equally broad sense to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. (e.g. Small 1926, von Arx & Müller 1954). However, it is unlikely that the type specimen of G. cingulata represents the same species as C. gloeosporioides s. str. (see notes under C. gloeosporioides). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s. str. is not known to form perithecia in culture, and there are no isolates of C. gloeosporioides s. str. known to us that are associated with a Glomerella state on diseased stems of Ligustrum, An isolate of C. Weir et al.

Glomerella cingulata var. brevispora Wollenw., Z. Parasitenk. (Berlin) 14: 260. 1949. Notes: Described from fruit rots from Germany, this name has not been used since. No cultures are available and its relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides complex is not known. * Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” (Dickens & Cook 1989). Figs 18, 19. Notes: Dickens & Cook (1989) proposed the name Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” for isolates morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides s. lat. that were highly pathogenic to leaves and shoots of ornamental Camellia saluenensis hybrids, causing the disease Camellia twig blight. These authors reported the fungus from plants imported into the UK from New Zealand and noted that a similar disease had been reported from plants grown in the UK, Fig. 18.

Scale bar of A applies to A–E. www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex147USA, Australia, France, and Italy. The disease has been reported from Camellia japonica, C. reticulata, and C. sasanqua. Although isolated in the UK from plants imported from New Zealand, this pathogen has not yet been found on Camellia plants growing in New Zealand.We have sequenced authentic isolates cited by Dickens & Cook (1989) as well as isolates pathogenic to Camellia saluenensis collected from the USA. They are similar to each other genetically as well as biologically and morphologically. ITS sequences alone distinguish G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” from all other taxa in the C. gloeosporioides complex, and there is good genetic evidence to consider these isolates to be representative of a distinct species within the C. kahawae clade. A new species is not proposed here because the relationship between the G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” isolates and C. camelliae, the fungus causing brown blight of tea, remains uncertain. Dickens & Cook (1989) also reported two C. acutatum strains from ornamental Camellia species that were avirulent in tests with detached Camellia cv. Donation leaves. Strain IMI 351261, deposited 1992 in IMI by R. Cook, is likely to be one of them. This strain was confirmed as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex and identified as C. lupini, which causes lupin anthracnose and is occasionally found on other hosts (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Another strain from Camellia reticulata from China belongs to C. fioriniae, also a species in the C. acutatum complex, while a strain from New Zealand (ICMP 10338) is C. boninense s. str. (Damm et al. 2012a, b, this issue).

Glomerella cingulata var. minor was described from Ficus from Germany, but Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) noted that the same fungus occurred also on other hosts in Europe, Africa, and America, including Malus and Coffea. Genetically the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. minor (CBS 238.49) matches the type specimen of C. fructicola, although the culture itself appears to be stale, with slow growth and an irregularly scalloped margin (see Fig. 19.

Glomerella cingulata “var. orbiculare” Jenkins & Winstead, Phytopathology 52: 15. 1962. Notes: Listed in Index Fungorum, this name was mentioned in an abstract, but is invalid (no Latin description) and never formally published. It was being used to refer to the teleomorph of Colletotrichum orbiculare, not part of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). Glomerella lagenaria (Pass.) F. Stevens, a recombination of the anamorphic name Fusarium lagenarium Pass., has also been used to refer to this teleomorph. Correll et al. (1993) comment on the pathogenicity of cucurbitassociated strains that form a Glomerella state in culture, suggesting a degree of confusion around the application of these names. Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. phaseoli” (Kimati & Galli 1970). Notes: Both G. cingulata “f. sp. phaseoli” (e.g. Castro et al. 2006) and Glomerella lindemuthiana (e.g. Rodríguez-Guerra et al. 2005, as G. lindemuthianum) have been used for the teleomorph of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in the recent literature, the two names placed in synonymy by Sutton (1992). This fungus is not part of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). Glomerella cingulata var. sorghicola Saccas, Agron. Trop. (Maracay). 9: 171. 1954. Notes: Not a member of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Sutton (1992) suggested using this name to refer to the teleomorph of Colletotrichum sublineola, although Crouch et al. (2006) note that C. sublineola has no known teleomorph. * Colletotrichum clidemiae B. Weir & P.R. Johnst. sp. nov. MycoBank MB563592.

Appressoria variable in shape, some simple, subglobose, but often with a small number of broad, irregular lobes. Perithecia mature after about 21 d, dark-walled, about 200–250 µm diam with short ostiolar neck, perithecial wall of 3–4 layers of angular cells 10–15 µm diam with walls thin, pale brown to brown. Asci 8-spored 60–67 × 10–14 µm. Ascospores (14–)15.5–19(–21.5) × 4.5–5.5(–6.5) µm (av. 17.2 × 5.0 µm, n = 46), oblong-elliptic, tapering to rounded ends, widest point toward one end, in side view flat on one side, rarely curved and if so, then slightly. Geographic distribution and host range: First reported from Clidemia, native to Panama, and subsequently introduced to Hawai’i as a pathogen of that host. Genetically matching isolates occur on native Vitis and Quercus spp. in Florida (see notes below). Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. clidemiae from C. aotearoa. The two species are best distinguished using ACT, GAPDH, or GS. Notes: Isolates referred to C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. clidemiae” by Trujillo et al. (1986) were highly pathogenic to Clidemia, but not to the other species of Melastomataceae tested. No voucher cultures of the original isolates collected from Panama were kept, but recent specimens isolated from naturalised Clidemia hirta plants in Hawai’i with typical disease symptoms are genetically uniform and distinct within the Kahawae clade. Phylogenetic, biological, and morphological evidence support this fungus being described as a new species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. A fungus isolated from a Vitis sp. in Florida and referred to as “Glomerella cingulata native host” by MacKenzie et al. (2007), is genetically close to our isolates from Clidemia and is here referred to the same species. Data in MacKenzie et al. (2007) shows the same fungus occurs on both Vitis and Quercus in Florida. Micromorphologically the isolates from Clidemia and from Vitis that we examined are similar with respect to the size and shape of appressoria, conidia, and ascospores. They are distinct in cultural appearance, the cultures of the Vitis-associated fungus having aerial mycelium darker and more dense, and a faster growth rate. Similar variation in cultural appearance is present in several of the phylogenetically defined species that we recognise. Whether or not the Clidemia-associated isolates are biologically distinct from the Vitis- and Quercus-associated isolates from Florida requires pathogenicity tests to determine. Other specimens examined: USA, Florida, Sarasota, on Vitis sp. leaf, coll. S. MacKenzie SS-Grape-12, 2002 (ICMP 18706); Hawai’i, Aiea, on Clidemia hirta leaf spot, coll. S.A. Ferreira & K.

Both C. coffeanum and G. coffeanum were described from leaves of coffee, the two species distinguished by Noak (1901) by the presence or absence of setae in the acervuli. There is a wide range of C. gloeosporioides-like species on coffee plants (see Waller et al. 1993 and notes under C. kahawae) and the relationships of C. coffeanum and G. coffeanum within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remain uncertain.

150Colletotrichum cordylines Pollacci, Atti Ist. Bot. Univ. Pavia, Serie 2, 5: 44. 1899. Notes: Described from leaves of Cordyline indivisa from a botanical garden in Italy, the genetic and biological status of this species is not known. Two Cordyline-associated species are accepted in this study, C. cordylinicola from Thailand and the newly described C. ti from New Zealand. The original description of C. cordylines is brief (Pollacci 1899) but it specifically mentions setae more than 100 µm long. Colletotrichum cordylinicola is described as lacking setae (Phoulivong et al. 2011) and in C. ti they are rare and when present much less than 100 µm long. The phylogenetic significance of this apparent difference and confirmation that these names represent different fungi requires DNA sequences to be generated from type material of C. cordylines. * Colletotrichum cordylinicola Phoulivong, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Mycotaxon 114: 251. 2011 [“2010”]. Fig. 22. Phoulivong et al. (2011) provide a description. Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Cordyline from Thailand and Eugenia from Laos. Genetic identification: ITS sequences separate C. cordylinicola from all other species. Notes: Phoulivong et al. (2011) report C. cordylinicola from Cordyline (Agavaceae) and Eugenia (Myrtaceae). They noted that the isolate from Eugenia was not pathogenic to Cordyline and vice versa, and they also showed that the specimens from the two hosts are genetically somewhat distinct, although forming a sister relationship amongst the taxa included in their analysis. The calmodulin gene tree generated from our sequence data together with the sequences provided by Phoulivong et al. (2011) (GenBank accession HM470236) supports placing the isolates from Eugenia and from Cordyline in the same species (unpubl. data). Colletotrichum cordylinicola is genetically distinct from a species associated with Cordyline leaf spots from New Zealand, described here as C. ti. See also notes under C. cordylines. Specimen examined: Thailand, Chiang Mai, Sam Sai District, Maejo Village, on Cordyline fruticosa, coll. S. Phoulivong, 15 Mar. 2009 (ex-holotype culture – MFLUCC 090551 = ICMP 18579).

Notes: Several isolates identified as Colletotrichum crassipes that have sequences accessioned to GenBank belong in C. gloeosporioides s. lat. GenBank accessions identified as C. crassipes that have a publically available culture include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (STE-U 5302 = CBS 112988 – AY376529, AY376577, FN557348, FN557538, and FN599821; STE-U 4445 = CBS 112984 – AY376530, AY376578, – FN557347, FN557537, and FN599820), along with several other species outside of the C. gloeosporioides complex (CBS 169.59 = IMI 309371 – AJ536230, FN557344, and FN599817; CBS 159.75 – FN557345 and FN599818; CBS 109355 – FN557346 and FN599819). Those with no isolates in a public collection include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (CORCS3 cited in Yang et al. (2011), HM584410, HM582002, HM585412), C. fructicola (strain 080912009 Jining, unpubl. data, FJ515007), and a possibly undescribed species within the Kahawae clade (strain SYJM02, unpubl. data, JF923835). Originally described from the berries of Vitis vinifera from Italy (Spegazzini 1878), the identity of C. crassipes remains unresolved. There is confusion regarding its morphology. Von Arx (1970) uses the name C. crassipes for fungi in which setae are rare, conidia are 22–34 × 6–8 µm (more or less matching the original description), and the lobed appressoria are distinctively globose in shape. Sutton (1980) uses a different morphological concept – setae common (according to Sutton these are rare in the otherwise morphologically similar C. musae), conidia 10–15 × 4.5–6.5 µm (Sutton’s concept of C. gloeosporioides is characterised by narrower conidia), and the appressoria deeply lobed. The conidial width cited for C. gloeosporioides by Sutton (1980), 3–4.5 µm, is narrower than we have found for all the taxa we accept within C. gloeosporioides s. lat., whereas his C. crassipes measurement of 4.5–6.5 µm matches many of the taxa we recognise. Several of these taxa also have deeply lobed appressoria.

Colletotrichum dracaenae Allesch., Rabenhorst’s Kryptogamen-Flora von Deutschland, Oesterreich und der Schweiz, Ed. 2, 1(7): 560. 1902. Notes: Farr et al. (2006) examined the type specimen of this species and concluded it was a member of C. gloeosporioides s. lat., based on conidial size and shape. Genetic data is not available to confirm this. See also discussion under C. petchii in Damm et al. (2012b, this issue) Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, Phytopathology 21: 113. 1931. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. theobromicola. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. theobromicola. The name C. fragariae was originally applied to isolates associated with a disease of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) runners (stolons) and petioles in Florida (Brooks 1931).

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex151von Arx (1957), it has continued to be used in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. It was accepted as distinct by Sutton (1992), although he noted confusion surrounding application of the name. Designation of one of Brook’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has allowed a modern, genetic basis for this name to be fixed. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae sits in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a wide range of hosts from many parts of the world, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, an earlier name for C. fragariae in the sense that we accept these species in this paper. There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex which inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) isolates that genetically match the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on strawberry. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA (Fig. 1), further work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.Xie et al. (2010b) provides a good example of the confusion that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated. Xie et al. (2010b) found 4 groups of isolates, each with a slightly different ITS sequence, two of those groups they considered to be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates as either C. fragariae of C. gloeosporioides they used a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment, one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS sequences only — the genetic differences between some of these species are small and are indicative only of possible relationships. However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. There are also several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).

Rehner & Samuels, Mycologia 102: 1331. 2010. = Glomerella cingulata var. minor Wollenw., Z. Parasitenk. (Berlin) 14: 261. 1949. Prihastuti et al. (2009) and Rojas et al. (2010) provide descriptions. Geographic distribution and host range: Originally reported from coffee berries from Thailand (as C. fructicola) and as a leaf endophyte from several plants in Central America (as C. ignotum), isolates that we accept as C. fructicola are biologically and geographically diverse. Known from Coffea from Thailand, Pyrus pyrifolia from Japan, Limonium from Israel, Malus domestica and Fragaria × ananassa from the USA, Persea americana from Australia, Ficus from Germany, Malus domestica from Brazil, Dioscorea from Nigeria, and Theobroma and Tetragastris from Panama.Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. fructicola from C. aeschynomenes and some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using GS or SOD2. Notes: Rojas et al. (2010) noted the occurrence of two distinct haplotype subgroups (A4-3 and A5-4) within their concept of C. ignotum. Our genetic analyses resolve the two clades representative of these two subgroups. However, together they are monophyletic within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides complex, and we retain them here as a single species. Both clades include isolates from a wide range of hosts from many countries, and both are similar in morphology and cultural appearance. The types of both C. fructicola and C. ignotum are in the same haplotype subgroup. The C. fructicola protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090228, but the culture derived from holotype as “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I16 in Table 1 of Prihastuti et al. (2009) but this number is not mentioned in the description. Culture BDP-I16 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study and deposited as ICMP 18581.

= Gloeosporium pedemontanum Pupillo, Ann. Sperim. Agrar. n.s. 6: 57. 1952. Cannon et al. (2008) provide a description of the species. Geographic distribution and host range: Most isolates of C. gloeosporioides are associated with Citrus, and in many parts of the world this fungus is common on Citrus, but it also occurs on other hosts including Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis. The isolate reported as a pathogen of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) by Yan et al. (2011) matches C. gloeosporioides s. str. genetically.

Genetic identification: ITS separates C. gloeosporioides from all other species. Notes: The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is currently in common use in two senses, one a genetically and biologically broad sense more or less following von Arx (1957, 1970) and Sutton (1992), including the whole species complex, the other a strict sense, encompassing only those specimens genetically matching the epitype selected for this name by Cannon et al. (2008). Depending on the context, use of the name in either sense can be useful. When used in a broad sense in this paper, it is referred to as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is often linked taxonomically to the teleomorph Glomerella cingulata, see notes under G. cingulata.

Notes: Originally described from the leaves of seedlings of Hevea brasiliensis from Sri Lanka, this fungus was described with very broad conidia, 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm. Carpenter & Stevenson (1954) considered this, and several other Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium and Glomerella species described from rubber, to be synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. The genetic relationship of these species to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. See also notes in Damm et al. (2012b, this issue) under Colletotrichum annelatum. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. hyperici” (Harris 1993).

Notes: This name was first used by Harris (1993) for strains of C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Hypericum perforatum. Earlier studies by Hildebrand & Jensen (1991) had found the Hypericum pathogen to be pathogenic also on several other plants. The genetic relationship of the Hypericum pathogen to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. Note that the exholotype culture of G. cingulata var. migrans, a variety here placed in synonymy with C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, was also isolated from Hypericum.Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” (Boyette et al. 1979).

Notes: Strains identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” are highly pathogenic, specialised pathogens of Jussiaea decurrens (Boyette et al. 1979). The genetic relationship of this taxon to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, or to Colletotrichum jussiaeae Earle, is unknown. Isolates pathogenic to Jussiaea have a similar conidial germination self-inhibitor profile to another isolate identified as C. fragariae (Tsurushima et al. 1995). The authentic isolate of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” deposited as ATCC 52634, is not included in this study.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. malvae” (Makowski & Mortensen 1989). Notes: Strains identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. malvae” were registered as a bioherbicide against round leafed mallow in Canada (Makowski & Mortensen 1989). The fungus was subsequently recognised as belonging to the C. orbiculare species complex (Bailey et al. 1996). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. manihotis” (Chevaugeon 1956).

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. melongenae Fournet, Ann. Mus. Civico Storia Nat. Genova 5: 13. 1973.

Notes: In addition to C. gloeosporioides f. melongenae, the names C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. melongenae”, C. melongenae Av.Saccá 1917, and C. melongenae Lobik 1928 have been used to refer to fungi associated with anthracnose diseases of Solanum melongena (e.g. Sherf & McNab 1986, Kaan 1973). Other names used for isolates from the same host have included Gloeosporium melongenae Ellis & Halst. 1891 and G. melongenae Sacc. 1916. The genetic relationships of these eggplant-associated taxa to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remain unknown. Solanum melongena associated species are known also from the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue).

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” (Killgore et al. 1999).

Notes: Killgore et al. (1999) reported that the isolates they recognised as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” were highly specialised pathogens of Miconia calvescens, unable to infect the closely related Clidemia hirta. The original voucher cultures are no longer available (pers. comm., Robert Barreto). Recently collected isolates from Miconia from the type locality in Brazil have proved to be genetically diverse across the C. gloeosporioides species complex, with isolates in both the Kahawae and Musae clades (unpubl. data). For now the genetic position of this pathogen remains unresolved. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minus Simmonds, Queensland J. Agric. Anim. Sci. 25: 178A. 1968.

Notes: Originally described from Citrus aurantium from Portugal, the name has not been used since it was described and its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. ortheziidae” (Marcelino et al. 2008). Notes: Marcelino et al.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Munaut, Mycol. Res. 106: 591. 2002.

Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. theobromicola; see notes under C. theobromicola. Irwin & Cameron (1978) and Munaut et al. (2002) described different diseases of Stylosanthes associated with Type A and Type B isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis, the two groups of isolates distinguished morphologically by growth rate in culture and by conidial morphology. Compared with Type A, the Type B isolates had a slower growth rate on PDA, and conidia more variable in size and shape (Irwin & Cameron 1978). They were also distinguished genetically using RFLP and similar methods (e.g. Munaut et al. 1998, 2002). Munaut et al. (2002) used ITS1 sequences to show the C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis to be related to an isolate they identified as C. fragariae. We regard C. fragariae to be a synonym of C. theobromicola, with putatively authentic Type A (HM335, C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis”) and Type B (HM 336, C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis”) isolates both also belonging to this species. From the ITS1 sequence data available, isolates regarded as typical of Type A (RAPD cluster I) and of Type B (RAPD cluster II) by Munaut et al. (1998) all belong in C. theobromicola in the sense that we are using the name; their RAPD cluster III isolate could be C. tropicale, and their RAPD cluster IV isolates are probably C. fructicola. The cultures of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis that we used were originally studied by Irwin & Cameron (1978), and selected as the “types” of “f. sp. guianensis” and “f. sp. stylosanthis” by Munaut et al. (2002). Both isolates have a ‘stale’ growth form, no longer forming conidia in culture and with aerial mycelium closely appressed to the agar surface, resulting in an almost slimy colony surface. Both isolates had a slow growth rate, similar to that reported for Type B isolates by Irwin & Cameron (1978). Genetically both isolates were identical for all the genes we sequenced. This identity should be checked against additional isolates, especially some matching Type A sensu Irwin & Cameron (1978) with respect to both pathogenicity and growth form. Sherriff et al. (1994), using ITS2 and partial 28S rDNA sequences, found isolates they considered to represent C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Type A and Type B respectively to be genetically distinct. However, their ITS2 sequences show that the putative Type B isolate in their study was in fact a member of the C. boninense species complex.

Notes: Described from uredinia and telia of Ravenelia sessilis on pods of Albizia lebbek, this name has not been used since it was described and its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. Colletotrichum gossypii Southw., J. Mycol. 6: 100. 1891. = Glomerella gossypii Edgerton, Mycologia 1: 119. 1909.

Notes: This species was originally described from the USA and was reported to cause disease symptoms on all parts of cotton plants, but especially the bolls (Southworth 1891, Edgerton 1909). Isolates identified as C. gossypii by Shear & Wood (1907) were reportedly associated with a Glomerella state in culture, and Edgerton (1909) described Glomerella gossypii from diseased, mature cotton plants in the USA Edgerton (1909) discussed differences in ascospore shape between G. gossypii and fruit-rotting isolates of G. cingulata, with G. gossypii having elliptic, not curved ascospores. Von Arx (1957) considered C. gossypii to be a synonym of C. gloeosporioides and von Arx & Müller (1954) regarded G. gossypii to be a synonym of G. cingulata. Modern authors have recognised two pathogens of cotton, C. gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides. Colletotrichum gossypii is reportedly the cause of cotton anthracnose, a damping-off disease of cotton seedlings, and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides the cause of ramulosis, a disease causing abnormal branching of mature plants (Bailey et al. 1996, Silva-Mann et al. 2005). In a study based on ITS2 sequences, Bailey et al. (1996) found C. gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides to be genetically distinct but with both belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Silva-Mann et al. (2005) also distinguished the two taxa genetically, based on an AFLP analysis. The only DNA sequences available for isolates identified as C. gossypii and C. Weir et al.

156gossypii var. cephalosporioides are ITS2 and the D2 region of the rDNA LSU, neither of which resolves their relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Whether the seedling pathogen regarded by Silva-Mann et al. (2005) and Bailey et al. (1996) to be C. gossypii represents the species first described from cotton in the USA is not known. The genetic relationship of these apparently biologically specialised fungi requires additional sequences to be generated from authentic isolates with known pathogenicity.

* Colletotrichum horii B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., Mycotaxon 111: 21. 2010.

Weir & Johnston (2010) and Xie et al. (2010a) provide descriptions. Geographic distribution and host range: Associated with fruit and stem disease of Diospyros kaki from China, Japan, and New Zealand. Xie et al. (2010a) noted minor symptoms on inoculated fruit of Capsicum annuum, Musa acuminata, and Cucurbita pepo, but noted that the fungus had never been associated with disease symptoms on these hosts from the field.

Genetic identification: ITS distinguishes C. horii from all other species. Specimens examined: See Weir & Johnston (2010). Colletotrichum hymenocallidis Yan L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138. 2009. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, also described from Hymenocallis, primarily on the basis of a multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony colour. Although gene selection was appropriate for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates were genetically distinct from the C. siamense isolates. However, in our analysis, in which the C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from all over the world, authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically. The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype but the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium specimen GZAAS 080001 as the holotype.

Wikee et al. (2011) discussed similarities between C. jasminisambac, C. siamense and C. hymenocallidis, three species genetically close in their phylogenetic analysis. The broader range of isolates representing C. siamense in our analysis shows that these species form a single, monophyletic clade that cannot be sensibly subdivided (see notes under C. siamense). Specimen examined: Vietnam, Cu Chi District, Trung An Ward, on living leaves of Jasminum sambac, Jan. 2009, coll. Hoa Nguyen Thi LLTA–01 (ex-holotype culture of C. jasmini-sambac – CBS 130420 = ICMP 19118). * Colletotrichum kahawae J.M. Waller & Bridge subsp. kahawae, Mycol. Res. 97: 993. 1993. Fig. 25. Waller et al. (1993) provide a description. Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Coffea from Africa. Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences are the same as those from C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS sequences; C. kahawae subsp. kahawae has a 22 bp deletion and a single C to T transition. Collectively, the two subspecies can be distinguished from all other species using ITS sequences alone. Notes: Colletotrichum kahawae was proposed by Waller et al. (1993) as a name to refer specifically to Colletotrichum isolates causing Coffee Berry Disease (CBD), to taxonomically distinguish these disease-causing isolates from the several other Colletotrichum spp. that can be isolated from coffee plants, including C. coffeanum (see notes under C. coffeanum). Colletotrichum kahawae is an apparently clonal population (Varzea et al. 2002), widespread on coffee in Africa, and with a distinctive growth form and biology (Waller et al. 1993). In this paper C. kahawae sensu Waller et al. (1993) is reduced to subspecies. Based on ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS gene sequences the coffee berry pathogen cannot be distinguished from isolates from a wide range of other hosts that are not pathogenic to coffee. Those other isolates are referred to here as C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. We retain a distinct taxonomic label for the coffee berry pathogen to reflect its biosecurity importance. In addition to its biology, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae can be distinguished metabolically, and genetically using GS gene sequences. Waller et al. (1993) used a metabolic test, an inability www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex157Fig. 25. Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. kahawae. A, E.

158to utilise either citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source, to help characterise isolates as C. kahawae. None of our C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates were able to utilise either citrate or tartrate, whereas all of the C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates were able to utilise one or both of these carbon sources (Weir & Johnston 2009). All of the C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates share a 22 bp deletion in the glutamine synthetase gene, lacking in the C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates. Note that one of the isolates metabolically and genetically typical C. kahawae subsp. kahawae (CBS 982.69) was reported by Gielink & Vermeulen (1983) to be non-pathogenic to coffee, but we have not independently checked this result. The isolates we accept as C. kahawae subsp. kahawae show two cultural types, one matching the description of Waller et al. (1993), slow growing, darkly pigmented cultures with conidia developing mostly in the aerial mycelium. The second cultural type grew even more slowly, had little or no pigmentation within the agar, and the colony surface was covered with numerous acervuli and orange conidial masses. Metabolically and genetically both cultural types were the same, and pathogenicity tests showed that the nonpigmented isolates caused CBD (unpubl. data, D. Silva, Centro de Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro). Rodriguez et al. (1991) reported further variation in cultural appearance amongst CBD causing isolates. Waller et al. 1993 stated that C. kahawae was not known to form ascospores. However, Gielink & Vermeulen (1983) observed the production of perithecia on coffee berries that had been inoculated with CBD-causing isolates, many months after inoculation and death of the berries. At least one of the isolates that they cited with this biology, CBS 135.30, has the GS sequence typical of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. Vermeulen et al. (1984) grew cultures from the perithecia that developed on the previously inoculated berries, and found that none were pathogenic to coffee. It is possible that the perithecia developing on inoculated berries reported by Gielink & Vermeulen (1983) were from other Colletotrichum spp. present on the berries before they were inoculated, and represented species distinct from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. A similar situation has been noted with some of our inoculations, where species present on tissues prior to inoculation, either endophytic or latent, started to sporulate on the dead tissue following inoculation (unpubl. data, B.S. Weir). Based on ITS sequences, most of the accessions in GenBank identified as C. kahawae and isolated from coffee, match our concept of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. There are two exceptions, AF534468 (from Malawi) and AY376540 (STE-U 5295 = IMI 319424 = CBS 112985, from Kenya). The Kenyan isolate was cited as C. kahawae in Lubbe et al. (2004). Based on the ITS sequences, and the TUB2 sequence from isolate STE-U 5295 (AY376588), these isolates represent C. siamense. Specimens examined: Angola, Ganada, on Coffea arabica berry, coll. J.N.M.

Etymology: Based on the title of the Jim Jarmusch movie “Coffee and Cigarettes”, referring to the close genetic relationship between C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro and the coffee pathogen C. kahawae subsp. kahawae; ciggaro is Portuguese for cigarette. Holotype: Australia, on Olea europaea, coll. V. Sergeeva UWS124, 1989, PDD 102232; ex-type culture ICMP 18539. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 75–85 mm diam after 10 d for most isolates, the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. migrans 48–49 mm diam. Aerial mycelium cottony, grey, dense, or in some isolates with dark stromatic masses and associated orange conidial ooze showing through mycelium from agar surface; in reverse agar with pinkish-orange pigments (6B4–7B4), irregular scattered black spots, and variable levels of development of overlying dark grey to green-grey pigments (4C2–5D4), these sometimes in discrete sectors. See notes below about a divergent growth form single ascospore cultures from perithecia in culture. Conidia form on dark-based acervuli, (12–)16–19.5(–29) × (4.5–) 5(–8) µm (av. 17.8 × 5.1 µm, n = 214), cylindric, straight, apex rounded, often tapering slightly towards the base. Appressoria typically cylindric to fusoid in shape, deeply lobed. Perithecia numerous, forming tightly packed clumps, individual perithecia globose, small, about 250 µm diam, with a short ostiolar neck. Asci 55–100 × 10–12 µm, 8–spored. Ascospores (13.5–)17.5–20(–24) × (4–)4.5–5(–6.5) µm (av. 18.8 × 4.8 µm, n = 121), gently curved, tapering to quite narrow, rounded ends, widest point usually towards one end of the spore. Geographic distribution and host range: Known from Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa. Both host and geographic range of the isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro are broad. Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences match those from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS sequences. Collectively, the two subspecies can be distinguished from all other species using ITS sequences alone. Notes: The authentic isolate of G. cingulata var. migrans (CBS 237.49) differed from all other isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro by its slower growth rate. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) distinguished Glomerella cingulata var. migrans from G. cingulata var. cingulata on the basis of pathogenicity (G. cingulata var. migrans was pathogenic to Hypericum and not to apple) and because of its slightly longer ascospores and shorter conidia — ascospores average 21 × 4.2 µm versus 18 × 4.6 µm, conidia average 14 × 5.2 µm versus 18 × 5 µm (Wollenweber & Hochapfel 1949). We were unable to produce ascospores from CBS 237.49, the conidia were similar in size to that reported by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949), averaging 16.6 × 5.3 µm. However, the average ascospore and conidial lengths of our C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates varied across the range cited by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) for both G. cingulata var. cingulata and G. cingulata var. migrans, the average ascospore length from individual isolates ranging from 16.6 to 20 µm, the average conidial length ranging from 14.9 to 21.2 µm. Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii was described by Shear (1907) for a fungus isolated from cranberry that was morphologically identical to isolates from apple and other hosts but which appeared to be biologically distinct (Shear 1907, Shear & Wood 1913). A putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited by Shear in CBS in 1922, matches C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro genetically. Polashock et al. (2009) discussed the diversity of Colletotrichum www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex159spp. associated with North American cranberry fruit rots, reporting a close match between their isolates and C. kahawae. Incorporation of their ITS sequences into our alignment confirms this. Whether or not there is a genetically distinct, cranberry specialised taxon within C. kahawae requires additional genes to be sequenced from the cranberry-associated isolates. Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro was referred to as C. gloeosporioides Group B by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston Fig. 26. Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro. A. ICMP 12952. B, D.

The original descriptions of both C. manihotis and Gloeosporium manihotis are of species with short, broad conidia (8–15 × 4–6 µm), and Chevaugeon (1956) regarded all of these cassava-associated fungi as con-specific. However, based on Fokunang et al. (2000), a morphologically highly diverse set of Colletotrichum isolates are associated with diseased plants. There are three GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from cassava, all from China, and although only ITS sequences are available for these isolates, they appear to represent a single, distinct species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. How these Chinese isolates relate to cassava-associated isolates from other parts of the world is not known. * Colletotrichum musae (Berk. & M.A. Curtis) Arx, Verh. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch., Afd. Natuurk., Sect. 2 51(3): 107. 1957. Fig. 28. Basionym: Myxosporium musae Berk. & M.A. Curtis, Grevillea 3: 13. 1874. Su et al. (2011) provide a description. Geographic distribution and host range: Found in association with fruit lesions of Musa spp. in many regions. Genetic identification: ITS sequences separate C. musae from all other species. Notes: Colletotrichum musae was originally described from North Carolina (Berkeley 1874), and the name was recently epitypified by Su et al. (2011) on the basis of a specimen collected in Florida Fig. 28. Colletotrichum musae. A. ICMP 12930. B. ICMP 18600. C. ICMP 17817 (ex IMI 52264).

162(ex-epitype culture CBS 116870). Su et al. (2011) cite several strains from Thailand that match their concept of C. musae, and isolates from anthracnose symptoms on banana fruit from several parts of the world are the same based on our study. These isolates form a well-supported clade within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, show low levels of genetic differentiation, and based on ITS sequences are consistent with C. musae sensu Sreenivasaprasad et al. (1996), Nirenberg et al. (2002) and Shenoy et al. (2007). The morphology in culture agrees with the description of Sutton & Waterston (1970). We have not seen a Glomerella state in culture and none was mentioned by Su et al. (2011). However, Rodriguez & Owen (1992) reported rare production of perithecia from crosses between two of 14 isolates identified as C. musae. It is not known whether the isolates studied by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) match our concept of C. musae genetically, but it is possible that this species behaves in a similar way to some species in the C. acutatum complex, where the sexual morph can be generated in culture under suitable conditions (Guerber & Correll 2001). The name “Glomerella musae”, used by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) and Krauss et al. (2001), has never been validly published. More than one species of Colletotrichum has been found in association with rotting banana fruit. From isolates with well characterised sequence data these include a species belonging to C. acutatum s. lat. (Sherriff et al. 1994, Johnston & Jones 1997) that is described as C. paxtonii (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue), and C. karstii that belongs to the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue). The latter forms a sexual stage in culture and is known from Musa in South America and Australia, as well as from many other hosts worldwide, often as an endophyte. Species in the C. boninense species complex have been previously confused with C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Greene (1967) referred isolates pathogenic to banana that were not associated with a teleomorph to C. musae, and a second non-pathogenic species that formed fertile ascospores, to C. gloeosporioides. Whether Glomerella musarum Petch, described from leaves of banana and cited as the teleomorph of C. musae by Sutton (1992) and Hyde et al. (2009), is a synonym of C. musae in the sense we use the name here is not known, but seems unlikely given the rare production of perithecia by this species.

Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from the USA, on the aquatic plants Nuphar and Nymphaea spp.

Genetic identification: One of the two ITS haplotypes of C. nupharicola is identical with C. queenslandicum. All other genes distinguish this species well from other species in the C. gloeosporioides complex.

Notes: Sequence data from the ex-holotype culture of C. nupharicola places it within the C. gloeosporioides complex, genetically close to C. fructicola and C. alienum in the Musae clade. This apparently host-specific species and has a distinctive, slow growth in culture and massive conidia (Johnson et al. 1997). Johnson et al. (1997) compare C. nupharicola with another water plant pathogen, C. nymphaeae, that is epitypified and shown to belong to the C. acutatum species complex by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue).

* Colletotrichum psidii Curzi, Atti dell’Istituto Botanico dell’Università di Pavia, ser. 3, 3: 207. 1927. Fig. 30.

Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 58–63 mm diam after 10 d, aerial mycelium dense, cottony to felted, uniform in height, white to off-white; in reverse uniformly pale creamy yellow (2A2–2A3) or in some cultures becoming dull greyish yellow (2D2–2E2) towards the centre. No conidiogenous cells or conidia seen. Geographic distribution and host range: Known from a single isolate, from Psidium from Italy. Genetic identification: Although known from only one isolate, ITS sequences separate C. psidii from all other taxa. Notes: A putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited in CBS by Curzi shortly after publication of C. psidii, represents a genetically distinct species within the Kahawae clade. The only available culture is stale, no longer forming conidia. Curzi (1927) describes the conidia as 12–15 × 3.5–4.5 µm, cylindric with rounded ends, straight or rarely slightly curved. Anthracnose diseases have been noted for Psidium spp. (guava) from several tropical regions of the world (e.g. MacCaughey 1917, Venkatakrishniah 1952, Liu 1972, Misra 2004). It is likely that several Colletotrichum spp. are associated with guava fruit rots. Whether the fungus described by Curzi from an Italian botanical garden represents one of the species causing a guava disease in the tropics is not known. All other members of the Kahawae clade are predominantly tropical, so perhaps this fungus was introduced to Italy along with its host plant. Misra (2004) uses C. psidii to refer to a Colletotrichum species with curved conidia. One other species has been described from this host, Glomerella psidii (basionym Gloeosporium psidii), the relationship www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex163Fig. 29.

Johnst., nom. nov. et stat. nov. MycoBank MB563593. Fig. 31.

Basionym: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minus Simmonds, Queensland J. Agric. Anim. Sci. 25: 178A. 1968. [as var. minor]Etymology: based on the region from which the type specimen of this species was collected. Holotype: Australia, Queensland, Ormiston, on Carica papaya, coll. J.H. Simmonds, Oct. 1965, IMI 117612. Epitype: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica papaya, coll. J.H. Simmonds 11663C, Sep. 1965, epitype here designated PDD 28797; ex-epitype culture ICMP 1778.

Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA 62–74 mm diam after 10 d, aerial mycelium either dense, cottony, uniform, grey, or with aerial mycelium lacking, towards centre of colony with numerous, small acervuli with dark bases and orange conidial ooze; in reverse cultures with copious aerial mycelium uniformly dark grey (1F2), those with little aerial mycelium having a pinkish brown (8B4) pigment within the agar, the dark bases of the acervuli and the colour of the conidial ooze visible through the agar. Conidia (12–)14.5–16.5(–21.5) × (3.5–)4.5–5(–6) µm (av. 15.5 × 4.8 µm, n = 96), cylindric, straight, sometimes slightly constricted near centre, ends broadly rounded. Appressoria about 6–12 µm diam., globose to short-cylindric, rarely lobed. Perithecia not seen. Geographic distribution and host range: Known from Carica papaya and Persea americana from Queensland, Australia, and from Coffea berries from Fiji. Simmonds (1965) reported from Australia what he considered to be the same fungus also from Mangifera indica, Malus sylvestris, and “many other hosts”. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. queenslandicum from some C. fructicola, some C. siamense, and some C. tropicale isolates. It is best distinguished from these taxa using TUB2, GAPDH, or GS. Notes: The ex-type cultures cited by Simmonds (1968) are no longer in storage at BRIP in Queensland (R. Shivas, pers. comm.) and presumably lost. However, we do have two cultures identified as C. gloeosporioides var. minus by Simmonds and isolated from the same host from the same locality as the holotype (Simmonds isolates 16633C and 1647A2), that had been sent to Joan Dingley in 1965 and subsequently stored in the ICMP culture collection. The culture selected here as epitype (Simmonds 11663C = ICMP 1778) matches the Simmonds (1965) description of this fungus as having “an abundance of aerial mycelium in culture”. Our conidial measurements from ICMP 1778 and 1780 are broader than those given by Simmonds (1965), but he does note that “Confusion can occur between narrower strains of C. gloeosporioides and broader strains of C. gloeosporioides var. minus …”. Simmonds (1965) also notes that perithecia may rarely be seen in cultures of some isolates. The isolates accepted here as C. queenslandicum are genetically distinct within the Musae clade of C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Colletotrichum minus Zimm. (1901) requires that we propose a nom. nov. for this fungus at species rank. Simmonds (1965) considered C. gloeosporioides var. minus to be the conidial state of Glomerella cingulata var. minor Wollenw. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) used the name Gloeosporium elasticae Cooke & Massee for the conidial state of G. cingulata var. minor, the type specimens for both names being from Ficus. Simmonds (1965) noted that it was not possible to transfer G. elasticae to Colletotrichum because Colletotrichum elasticae had already been published for a different fungus. However, rather than proposing a nom. nov. for Gloeosporium elasticae, he described C. gloeosporioides var. minus as a new variety, with a different type specimen. Glomerella cingulata var. minor is genetically distinct from the specimen Simmonds chose as the type of C. gloeosporioides var. minus, see notes under G. cingulata var. minor. Other specimens examined: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica sp., coll. J.H. Simmonds 16347A2 (ICMP 1780, dried culture stored as PDD 28797); Queensland, Home Hill, on Persea americana, coll.

Note that Saccardo & Trotter (1913) place Shear’s variety in Glomerella fructigena (Clint.) Sacc., a rarely used species name, placed in synonymy with G. cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954).

Perithecia not seen. Geographic distribution and host range: Known from throughout the geographic range of Salsola tragus (Berner et al. 2009), reported in nature only from Salsola spp. Genetic identification: ITS sequences of C. salsolae are very close to C. alienum and some C. siamense isolates. These species can be distinguished using TUB2 or GAPDH. Notes: Isolates of C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Salsola tragus were reported by Schwarczinger et al. (1998) and referred to as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. salsolae” by Berner et al. (2009). Although mildly pathogenic to a wide range of hosts in glasshouse pathogenicity tests, this fungus causes severe disease only on Salsola spp. with the exception of S. orientalis, S. soda, and S. vermiculata (Berner et al. 2009). Colletotrichum salsolae belongs to the Musae clade, and although genetically close to several other species, it is biologically and morphologically distinctive. Other specimen examined: Hungary, additional isolate of strain selected as the holotype, recovered from inoculated Glycine max plants (MCA 2498 = CBS 119296 = ICMP 18693). * Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L.

Descriptions of this species are provided by Prihastuti et al. (2009), Wikee et al. (2011), and Yang et al. (2009).

Geographic distribution and host range: Colletotrichum siamense was originally described from coffee from Thailand, but our concept of this species is biologically and geographically diverse, found on many hosts across several tropical and subtropical regions.

Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not reliably separate C. siamense from C. alienum, C. fructicola, or C. tropicale. These species are best distinguished using CAL or TUB2. Notes: Yang et al. (2009) and Wikee et al. (2011) discussed genetic and morphological differences between C. siamense, C. jasminisambac, and C. hymenocallidis. However, both studies used a limited set of isolates within the C. gloeosporioides complex, making interpretation of the genetic differences difficult. The morphological differences they described are commonly seen as within-species variation in other Colletotrichum spp. In our analysis, C. siamense is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from several tropical regions, and forms a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided genetically. Variation in cultural appearance is broad but in part this probably reflects the different conditions under which the isolates had been stored. Shape and size of appressoria, and the characteristically small conidia are similar in all isolates. Based on matching translation elongation factor (TEF) and TUB2 sequences, isolates referred by Rojas et al. (2010) to Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2 also represent C. siamense. Note that TEF data was excluded from our phylogenetic analyses because the TEF gene tree was often incongruent with the trees from the other genes that we sequenced. For example, compare our isolate ICMP 17797 (GenBank GU174571) with isolates Rojas et al. (2010) cite as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2, V1H1_1 (GenBank GU994297) and 7767 (GenBank GU994298). The C. siamense protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090230, but the culture derived from holotype as “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I2 in Table 1 of Prihastuti et al. (2009) but not in the description of the species. Strain BDP-I2 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study and deposited as ICMP 18578.

Geographic distribution and host range: Broadly distributed in tropical and subtropical regions on a wide range of hosts.

This characteristic feature of the ITS-1 is found also in the ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola, the ex-epitype isolate of C. fragariae and all other isolates of C. theobromicola, although a few isolates have 3 additional C’s rather than 2. None of the other isolates that we sampled from the C. gloeosporioides species complex have this characteristic string of C’s. Rojas et al.

None of the isolates that we examined formed perithecia in culture.

Etymology: Based on the Maori name for Cordyline australis, tī. Holotype: New Zealand, Taupo, on Cordyline sp., coll. J.M. Dingley 65187, Sep. 1965, PDD 24881; ex-holotype culture ICMP 4832.

Leaf spots oblong to elliptic in shape, up to about 1 × 2 mm, sometimes coalescing when close together on a leaf, pale grey and necrotic in the centre with a reddish margin; acervuli numerous, base pale to dark grey, with scattered, dark brown setae about 50–80 µm long. Perithecia not seen on infected leaves. Freshly isolated colonies on Difco PDA 50–55 mm diam after 10 d, margin slightly irregular and feathery, aerial mycelium lacking from ex-holotype culture, when present fine, cottony, pale grey, surface of colony dark towards the centre, pale pinkish orange (7A6) towards margin, conidia forming over all parts of culture, mostly not associated with well differentiated acervuli, setae not observed; in reverse purple (12E3) near centre, orange outside, sometimes with concentric rings of grey pigment. Conidiogenous cells cylindric, mostly 15–25 × 3.5–4.5 µm, towards centre of colony arranged in closely packed palisade, towards margin the conidiophores with a much looser structure, irregularly branched, conidiogenous loci at apex and often also at septa. Conidia (11.5–)14–17.5(–23.5) × (4–)5–5.5(–7.5) µm (av. 16 × 5.2 µm, n = 53), cylindric, ends broadly rounded, sometimes tapering towards basal end. Appressoria often narrow-cylindric, often tapering towards apex, sometimes irregularly lobed. Perithecia developing in small numbers in culture after about 4 wk, solitary, scattered across plate, dark-walled, globose with well-developed, tapering ostiolar neck. Asci (60–)65–75(–78) × (10–) 11(–12) µm (av. 69.6 × 11 µm, n = 5), cylindric to subfusoid, 8–spored. Ascospores (14.5–)15.5–16.5(–19) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6) µm (av. 15.9 × 5.2 µm, n=18), broad-cylindric, ends broadly rounded, not tapering to the ends, in side view mostly flat on one side, often slightly curved. Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Cordyline spp. from New Zealand. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not distinguish C. ti from C. aotearoa. The two species can be distinguished using TUB2 or GAPDH. Notes: A member of the Kahawae clade, this fungus causes a leaf spot of Cordyline spp. in New Zealand. It is genetically distinct from C. cordylinicola, described from Cordyline fruticosa from Thailand. Based on the published description of C. cordylinicola (Phoulivong et al. 2011) the two fungi are morphologically similar. Inoculation tests using culture ICMP 5285 when freshly isolated (J.M. Dingley, unpublished data), showed it to be pathogenic to Cordyline australis, forming spots on leaves 2 wk after inoculation, but causing no symptoms on apple, even after wounding. Although only four of the specimens examined have been compared genetically, all of the cited specimens examined match in terms of associated symptoms and conidial size and shape. A specimen from Cordyline banksii (PDD 78360) has narrower conidia, forms perithecia on the infected leaves, and perhaps represents a different species. Specimens accepted here as C. ti were referred to Glomerella cingulata by Laundon (1972). The appearance in culture varies between isolates. The J.M. Dingley cultures, first isolated in the mid-1960’s, have dense, felted aerial mycelium and limited conidial production; one has a much slower growth rate than the more recent collections. Other specimens examined: New Zealand, Auckland, on Cordyline australis, coll. J.M.

Rehner & Samuels, Mycologia 102: 1331. 2010. Fig. 37. Rojas et al. (2010) provide a description.

Geographic distribution and host range: Rojas et al. (2010) noted that C. tropicale has been isolated from a wide range of hosts in forests in tropical America, from rotting fruit as well as leaf endophytes. We include also an isolate from tropical Japan, from Litchi chinensis leaves.

Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. tropicale from some C. siamense or some C. queenslandicum isolates. Colletotrichum tropicale is best distinguished using TUB2, CHS-1, GS, or SOD2. Notes: Colletotrichum tropicale is genetically close to C. siamense and the two species share a number of morphological features; slow growth in culture, short and broad conidia with broadly rounded ends and often slightly constricted near the centre, and simple appressoria.

One of the isolates we examined (ICMP 17820) formed fertile perithecia in culture, a feature not mentioned in the original description. Perithecia are dark-walled, globose with a prominent, narrow neck, wall comprising several layers of pseudoparenchymatous cells 8–15 µm diam, with several layers of densely packed hyphae outside this. Asci 75–100 × 10–12 µm, 8-spored. Ascospores (17–)18.5–20(–22) × (5–)5.5–6 µm (av. 19.4 × 5.6 µm, n = 24), more or less elliptic, tapering to narrow, rounded ends, in side view flattened on one side, but generally not curved.

Genetic identification: ITS sequences distinguish C. xanthorrhoeae from all other species. Notes: This pathogen of Xanthorrhoea has a distinctive morphology, with a very slow growth rate in culture and large conidia which taper towards the basal end. The ascospore shape is distinct to that of most taxa within the C. gloeosporioides group, which typically have bent or curved ascospores. Specimens examined: Australia, Western Australia, Melville, on Xanthorrhoea preissii leaf spots, coll. F.D. Podger, Jan. 1994 (ex-holotype culture − BRIP 45094 = ICMP 17903 = CBS 127831); Queensland, Cunningham’s Gap, Main Ranges National Park, on Xanthorrhoea sp. leaf spot (IMI 350817a = ICMP 17820). DISCUSSION The species that we accept in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex together form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also be a problem. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarised the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts around the name C. gloeosporioides makes this a particular problem. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, that shows the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. See notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae for specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions. The species we accept are based on a phylogenetic species concept, all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal clades are recognised as named species. In most cases any well supported, within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the multi-gene phylogeny is not resolved consistently in all gene trees. This lack of congruence between gene trees is a signal that the diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although the concatenation of gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it masks discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach (Figs 3, 4B, 5B) combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesised to represent a single species, so that the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates is estimated. Fig. 3, shows the results of such an analysis for the C. gloeosporioides complex, Figs 4B and 5B show relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades respectively, at an expanded scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae clades. This may be because although the species-trees algorithms account for incomplete lineage sorting (Heled & Drummond 2010, Chung & Ané 2011), most do not compensate for horizontal gene transfer, reassortment, or introgression. Hybridisation could also result in discordant gene phylogenies. Hybrids are known in the C. acutatum complex, e.g. Glomerella acutata, a hybrid formed by crossing C. acutatum and C. fioriniae strains in the laboratory, and a putative hybrid strain between the same two species that had been collected from terminal crook disease on Pinus in New Zealand, where both species occur in nature (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Hybrids also form in the C. gloeosporioides complex, e.g. the Carya and Aeschynomene populations discussed by Cisar et al. (1994), more or less genetically equivalent to our species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.

Our taxonomic conclusions are based, of necessity, on the limited set of genes sampled. Potentially more powerful genes, such as ApMAT and Apn25L (Silva et al. 2012a) may provide finer resolution within the species-level clades that we recognise. However, even with these potentially more informative genes, the low levels of genetic divergence across the C. gloeosporioides complex may always provide a technical challenge (Silva et al. 2012a). The low level of diversity within this species complex is reflected by the branch lengths in fig. 2, Cannon et al. (2012, this volume), and is especially true across the Musae clade, where average pairwise identity between all isolates treated in our 5 gene alignment is 98.6 %. Pairwise identity between isolates of C. siamense and C. theobromicola, two species showing strong within-species phylogenetic structure, are 99.4 % and 99.6% respectively. This suggests that the species recognised within the C. gloeosporioides complex are very recently evolved and Silva et al. (2012b) provide data supporting this. Their hypothesis of recent evolution of host-specialised Colletotrichum populations from more generalist fungi was also invoked in relation to the C. acutatum complex by Lardner et al. (1999) using the “episodic selection” framework of Brasier (1995). Several of the species we accept contain isolates with divergent lifestyles, for example C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae, and C. theobromicola. Each of these species includes isolates capable of causing specific diseases. In the case of C. kahawae, recent pathogenicity tests have shown that only some isolates are able to cause coffee berry disease (Silva et al. 2012a, Silva & Weir, unpubl. data) and that these isolates can be distinguished using GS sequences (this study), Apn25L and MAT1-2-1 (Silva et al. 2012b). Because of the well understood pathogenicity of isolates within Weir et al.

Future study of the comparative pathogenicity of isolates within C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, and C. theobromicola may reveal genetically distinct, host-specialised pathogenic populations within these species that future workers may also choose to recognise taxonomically.

The classification we accept here is deliberately taxonomically conservative, minimising nomenclatural changes. This reflects continuing uncertainty about sensible species limits within the C. gloeosporioides complex that relate to low levels of genetic divergence across the complex, gene selection, isolate selection, and a lack of understanding of the mechanisms driving species and population divergence amongst these fungi. For example, the two haplotype subgroups of C. fructicola are not distinguished taxonomically because collectively they form a monophyletic clade, both subgroups include sets of isolates with similar geographic and host diversity, and there is no practical need to distinguish them taxonomically.

Molecular tools are increasingly being used for day-to-day identification by biosecurity officers and plant pathology researchers, providing a need for both a taxonomy that closely reflects groups that are resolved genetically, as well as simple and reliable protocols for identifying those taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). Although ITS is useful at the species complex level, it does a poor job of resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, resolving only 10 of 22 accepted species. This reflects the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the C. gloeosporioides complex; species often distinguished by only one or two base changes. In some cases, chance variation in the ITS sequence within or between species means that some species cannot be distinguished (Fig. 6). Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti and some C. siamense isolates; C. fructicola and some C. siamense isolates; and C. alienum, C. aenigma and some C. siamense isolates.

Protein-coding genes and their introns often have more variation than ITS, and the need for secondary barcodes based on these kinds of genes has been discussed in relation to some groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006, Aguileta et al. 2008, Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein coding genes that were used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode to obtain an accurate identification of species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the genes performance as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009) with GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performing well, but CHS1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) poorly. However, the analysis (Cai et al. 2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, the Musae and Kahawae clades being treated at the level of species. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes we analysed provides an effective barcode ont its own across the entire complex. Of the single genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are amongst the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree and GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola and C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the genes tested to amplify and sequence, however when using this gene GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, and C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions we provide notes on which genes are the best for genetic identifications, and in Table 4 these are summarised for all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates the species boundaries may not be accurate, we recommend two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the whole genus will be required to find the combination of genes that are effective for all species of the genus that distinguish all Colletotrichum species.

Several studies have shown that cultural morphology can be useful for grouping isolates when they are sampled at a local or regional level (e.g. Johnston & Jones 1997, Prihastuti et al. 2009). However, our experience is that such groups often break down when the geographic sample within a clade is extended to a global scale. Many of the species we accept have few or no diagnostic morphological or cultural features that can be consistently and reliably used to identify them. Our morphological examinations were confined to cultures on Difco PDA agar plates, and we will have missed any features that develop solely in association with plant material. In addition, the cultures we used have been sourced from different labs and collections from around the world, many with no information on storage history. Storage history and method has a major impact on the appearance of Colletotrichum in culture. Cultures can become “stale” during storage, losing the ability to produce pigments, the aerial mycelium often becoming very dense and felted, and losing the ability to form well-differentiated acervuli, conidia, or perithecia. In some clades, even freshly isolated cultures are highly variable, forming distinct sectors with differences in the production of pigment, aerial mycelium, acervuli, and conidia. Some isolates form two very different cultural types from single conidia or ascospores derived from colonies themselves started from single ascospores. Figure 27F shows single ascospore cultures from an isolate of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. One has the typical appearance of cultures of this fungus isolated from the field. The other, with a uniform, dense layer of conidia across the colony surface without well differentiated acervuli and more or less no aerial mycelium, is common from single ascospore isolates in culture, but rarely found in cultures isolated directly from the field. This kind of variation, and that revealed from sectoring during colony growth, makes morphological variation difficult to interpret for accurate identification. Many of the species recognised in this work remain poorly understood in terms of their pathogenicity and host preference. This in part reflects a lack of certainty about the biological relationship between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonisation of senescing tissue, such as the C. salicis example discussed by Johnston (2000, as Glomerella miyabeana). The multiple Colletotrichum spp. associated with a single host are likely to have a variety of life styles: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species with the ability to invade and cause minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and fruit only following senescence of the host tissue or ripening of host fruit and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of this range of distinct life styles, the fact that several Colletotrichum spp. may become established on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts, has been a large part of the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum. In some cases, apparently clear differences in pathogenicity of isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex are not reflected Weir et al.

176genetically. For example, the fungi referred to as C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis” and C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis”, are reportedly associated with two distinct diseases of Stylosanthes (Irwin & Cameron 1978; Munaut et al. 2002), but both taxa genetically match C. theobromicola and are here placed in synonymy with C. theobromicola. It is possible that screening additional genes across a set of isolates from Stylosanthes with known pathogenicity will reveal one or more genes that generate a phylogeny that correlates with pathogenicity. This is the case with another specialised pathogen, C. kahawae. Originally described as a pathogen of green coffee berries, almost genetically identical isolates have subsequently been found on a wide range of hosts (see notes under C. kahawae). The isolates from other hosts are not pathogenic to coffee berries (Silva et al. 2012b). The difference in pathogenicity correlates with a genetic difference in the GS gene, and we taxonomically recognise this biologically specialised population at the subspecies level. A similar approach could potentially be taken for other biologically distinct populations within a genetically strongly supported species.

Despite the epitypification of C. gloeosporioides in 2008, web search hits on the name C. gloeosporioides from papers published over the past 12 mo show that many authors will continue to use the name in the sense of the C. gloeosporioides species complex, presumably regarding this level of identification as sufficient for their research. All of the isolates that we accept in the C. gloeosporioides complex share the string 5’–GGGCGGGT–3’ about 139–142 bases after the ITS1F primer binding site. Based on a comparison with GenBank data, this string appears to be specific to isolates that we would accept as members of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Several authors have developed PCR-based, rapid identification tools for distinguishing members of the C. gloeosporioides complex from members of the C. acutatum species complex. This has been prompted because some members of the C. acutatum complex have conidia without the acute ends characteristic of this species as described by Simmonds (1965), and have at times been confused with C. gloeosporioides (Damm et al. 2012, this issue). Primers reportedly specific to C. gloeosporioides include the CgInt primer for ITS (Mills et al. 1992). In our data set this primer sequence is found in C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. fructicola, and C. siamense but all of the other taxa that we recognise within the C. gloeosporioides complex have one or more bases not matching the CgInt primer. The practical impact of these differences will depend in part on the position of the mismatch and stringency of the PCR reaction. Talhinas et al. (2005) discussed the TBCG primer for β-tubulin, and this is found within all of our taxa within the C. gloeosporioides group except C. musae and C. asianum. Liu et al. (2011) describe characteristic RFLP bands from glutamine synthetase using the restriction enzyme Pst1. Based on our sequences, this method will generate the characteristic C. gloeosporioides bands reported by Liu et al. (2011) for C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. asianum, C. clidemiae, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. horii, C. queenslandicum, C. salsolae, C. siamense, C. ti, and C. tropicale. Different banding patterns will be produced by C. aeschynomenes (band sizes 253, 316, 388), the two C. kahawae subspp. (band sizes 112, 388, 457), G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” (band sizes 51, 112, 337, 457), and C. musae (band sizes 388, 552), but none match the bands reported for C. acutatum by these authors.

There are exceptions, such as the pecan-associated isolates from Liu et al. (2011), and the pistachio-associated isolates reported by Yang et al. (2011), both of which appear to represent undescribed species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Clearly, more species remain to be described within the C. gloeosporioides complex. In addition, taxonomic issues still to be resolved amongst the species discussed in this paper include the relationship between G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” and C. camelliae, the identity of the cotton pathogens referred to C. gossypii, the identity of the cassava pathogens referred to C. manihotis, the relationship between C. aeschynomenes and C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae”, whether the various yam diseases discussed in the literature are all caused by C. alatae, and whether the isolates of C. aotearoa from Meryta leaf spots form a biologically distinct population. A more general question relates to better understanding the frequency of hybrids within the C. gloeosporioides complex and the impact of this on the interpretation of the phylogenies within the complex. The impact of hybridisation on the evolution of disease specialised populations has barely been explored.
