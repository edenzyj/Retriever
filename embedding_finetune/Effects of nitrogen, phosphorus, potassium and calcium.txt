The effects of a range of concentrations of four nutrients – nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium – in fertilizer solutions on the severity of anthracnose on strawberry cv. Nyoho cultivated under a noncirculation hydroponics system were determined after inoculation with  
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  . Crop growth and tissue nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium contents of the entire above-ground parts of the plant were also investigated. Elevated nitrogen and potassium concentrations in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity in contrast to phosphorus and calcium.
Treatment with either NH  4   or NO  3   nitrogen was not significantly different. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (  
R  2   = 0·9078) and phosphorus (  
R  2   = 0·8842), but was not influenced by the elevated amounts of potassium (  
R  2   = 0·8587) and calcium (  
R  2   = 0·6526) concentrations.  Keywords  :  
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides  , disease severity, fertilizer, macronutrients, strawberry anthracnose  Introduction  In Korea, strawberries (  
Fragaria    ×    ananassa  ) are favoured for winter cultivation when the production of other vege tables and fruits is relatively low. In 2003 strawberries were planted on a total area of 7503 ha in Korea, with plastic greenhouse cultivation comprising 7172 ha and production for fresh market totalling 205 427 tonnes (Anonymous, 2004). The use of forcing, where straw berries are transplanted into greenhouses in mid-September and forced into fruiting in December (Oda, 1991), is increasing in Korea. June-bearing cultivars such as Mae hyang, Akihime and Nyoho used for forcing have proven difficult to grow due to their susceptibility to anthracnose (Nam  et al  ., 1998; Kim & Nam, 1999). Anthracnose is one of the most damaging diseases of strawberries, caus ing wilting and death of transplants in the nursery field.
The pathogen known to be responsible for the disease inKorea is  
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides   and was initially reported in 1992 (Kim  et al  ., 1992).
The nutritional status of a plant has a major impact on susceptibility to disease, and this has been exploited for the reduction of disease severity (Huber & Watson, 1974;
Engelhard, 1989; Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993). In parti cular, nitrogen, and the form of nitrogen used, can be influential. For example, black root rot complex (  Rhizoc tonia fragariae  /  
Pratylenchus penetrans  ) of strawberries was suppressed by application of (NH  4  )  2  SO  4   (Elmer &LaMondia, 1999), and  
C. phomoides   was controlled using NH  4  -N fertilizer (Williams, 1965). However, the severity of fusarium disease of tomato (Duffy & Dèfago, 1999) and anthracnose (  
C. gossypii  ) of cotton (Huber &
Watson, 1974) was elevated with NH  4  -N. Similarly, rice blast disease (  
Magnaporthe grisea  ) is exacerbated in the presence of excess nitrogen (Teng, 1994). In contrast, when calcium was applied, tomato showed increased resistance to fusarium wilt (Woltz  et al  ., 1992).
Little is currently known about the influence of plant nutrition on anthracnose of strawberry. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of concentration of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium and calcium on the development of strawberry anthracnose, with the aim of developing practical strategies to manage the disease.  Materials and methods  Plant preparation  
Tissue-cultured seedlings of strawberry cv. Nyoho at the three-leaf stage were transplanted into 15 cm (1·6 L) plas tic pots containing perlite. Transplants were irrigated for a month with distilled water to leach out nutrients con tained in the perlite. This also lowered the tissue nutrient content of the strawberry plants. Following this, plants  *E-mail: hgkim@cnu.ac.kr

Effects of N, P, K and Ca on strawberry anthracnose  247 were watered with the nutrient treatment solution every 2 days for 50 days.  Nutrient solutions  
Hoagland nutrient solution (Hoagland & Arnon, 1950) was modified to make treatment solutions containing 0, 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 m  m   nitrogen; 0, 0·25, 0·5, 0·75, 1 and 3 m  m   phosphorus; 0, 10, 20 and 30 m  m   potassium; or 0, 1·5, 3, 4·5 and 6·0 m  m   calcium. The composition and chemical sources of micronutrients are shown in Table 1.
The pH of all treatment solutions were adjusted to 6·5 using 1 N HCl or KOH. The effect of the form of nitrogen was tested by comparing 5, 10 and 15 m  m   nitrate and ammonium compounds.  Cultural practice  
The experimental design was a completely randomized plot with five replications. Pots were placed 25 cm apart in rows. The experiment was conducted in a glasshouse with a temperature range of 17–18  °  C at night and 24– 28  °  
C during the day. The relative humidity ranged from 40 to 80%, and daylight intensity from 550 to 1200 mol m  −  2   s  −  1   during the experimental period.  Plant analysis  
Plant tissue was sampled from shoots after 1 month of nutrient solution treatments. Tissue samples were washed with 0·2 N HCl for 1 min, rinsed with distilled water, dried for 2 days at 70  °  
C, and ground in a Wiley mill to pass through the 1 mm particle size sieve. Total N was deter mined by a modified Kjeldahl procedure which included a salicylic acid pretreatment to aid in the reduction of NO  3  (Eastin, 1978). Tissue used for P, K and Ca analysis was dry-ashed at 500  °  
C, dehydrated in HCl and finally dissolved in 0·5 N HCl. Analysis of K and Ca was done by atomic absorption spectrometry, and colorimetric analysis was performed for P (Chapman & Pratt, 1961).  
Inoculation and disease assessment  
Growth characteristics were determined for plants after 1 month of nutrient solution treatments. Inoculum of  
C. gloeosporioides   (CGF43) was prepared at 10  6   conidia mL  −  1   and sprayed on the plants. The inoculated plants were incubated in dew chamber at 30  °  
C and 100% RH for 2 days and then moved to a glasshouse held between 24 and 28  °  
C (Gupton & Smith, 1991). After 17 days, the disease severity on each plant was rated. Disease severity was rated as a disease index (DI) on a scale of 0–4, as follows: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% of petioles affected; 2,  ≥   50% of petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on entire plants (Ishikawa  et al  ., 1989).  Data analysis  
Data from nutrient concentrations and different nitrogen source trials were subjected to analysis of variance, and treatment means were compared by Duncan’s multiple range test at  
P   = 0·05. The relationships between nutrient concentrations and dry weight, and nutrient concentra tions and disease index, were evaluated using regression analysis (Duffy & Dèfago, 1999; Choi  et al  ., 2000). All data analysis was performed using the SAS program (SASInstitute, Inc., USA).  Results and discussion  
Dry weight of strawberry plants was greatest when provided with 30 m  m   nitrogen, 1 m  m   phosphorus, 10 m  m   potassium, and 3 m  m   calcium (Table 2).
Anthracnose symptoms first appeared in the nitrogen treatment approximately 2 weeks after inoculation. A positive correlation (adjusted (Adj)  
R  2   = 0·96) was found between nitrogen concentration of treatment solution and anthracnose disease (Fig. 1a). Disease was greatest (DI  ∼  3) at a nitrogen concentration of 30 m  m  . Anthracnose tended to be more severe in treatments receiving NH  4   than
NO  3  , but these differences were not significant according to Duncan’s multiple range test (  
P =   0·05) (Fig. 2). A similar positive relationship (adjusted  
R  2   = 0·84) between disease and potassium concentration of treatment solution was shown, with a maximum DI of  ∼  3 at 30 m  m   potassium

Plant Pathology   (2006)  55  , 246–249  248  M. H. Nam  et al. (Fig. 1c). In contrast, neither increasing concentrations of calcium (  
P =   0·62) nor those of phosphorus (  
P =   0·68) had a patterned effect on disease (Fig. 1b and d). For all treatments, the relative dry matter content of each nutrient in the test plants increased with increasing concentration in the treatment solution (Fig. 1).
Previous studies have shown correlations between nitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose, as in the case of cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Previously,
Choi  et al  . (2000) showed that, as tissue nitrogen content decreased, Ca and Mn contents, which have a direct role in phenolic metabolism, increased in the strawberry. Man ganese may increase synthesis of host defence products and thereby reduce disease incidence and/or severity (Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993), whilst calcium has been shown to inhibit anthracnose (caused by  C. gloeosporio ides   or  
C. acutatum  ) in apples (Biggs, 1999) and decrease postharvest disease development on strawberry (Cheour  et al  ., 1990). Woltz  et al  . (1992) also found that treatment with CaCO  3   (3·0 kg m  −  3  ) in tomato reduced fusarium crown rot disease. Calcium may be important for resist ance against certain cell-wall-degrading enzymes pro duced by fungal pathogens (Conway & Sams, 1984; Biggs & Peterson, 1990). However, in this study, no effect was found of calcium content on anthracnose disease in straw berry. As manganese content is increased under low nitro gen conditions in plants, additional work is needed to determine whether manganese levels are related to anthrac nose development. Phosphorus supplied as phosphite was effective at reducing phytophthora root and crown rot on tomato and pepper plants but also suppressed plant growth (Förster  et al  ., 1998).

Effects of N, P, K and Ca on strawberry anthracnose 249 phosphorus concentration had no influence on anthrac nose development.
Strawberry prefers NH4 to NO3 nitrogen for optimal growth (Park, 1990). Other studies have shown the use of the former increases cotton anthracnose (Bollenbacher & Fulton, 1971) and fusarium crown rot severity (Woltz et al., 1992) more than the use of nitrate. It was found on average that strawberry plants receiving ammonium nitrogen had more disease than those receiving nitrate treatments, but these differences were not significant.
It has been shown that increasing nitrogen and potas sium in nutrient solutions resulted in higher dry matter percentages of both elements in strawberry but also increased the severity of anthracnose. To decrease anthrac nose in strawberries, it is suggested that a minimum of nitrogen and potassium should be present in any fertilizer used and that this should not exceed 15 and 10 units of nitrogen and potassium, respectively.References
