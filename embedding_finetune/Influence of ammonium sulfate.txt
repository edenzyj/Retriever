Black root rot is a complex root disease of strawberry (Fragaria X ananassa
Duchesne) which causes root death and reduces plant vigor, productivity, and win ter survival (4,13,15,26). Although many organisms are implicated in black root rot, surveys in Connecticut and elsewhere found that a binucleate Rhizoctonia sp. (R.
fragariae Hussain and McKeen; 13) in anastomosis groups AG-A, AG-G, and
AG-I (16,17); lesion nematodes (Praty lenchus penetrans (Cobb) Filip. & Shur. Stek) (2,7,8,15,20,23,26); or both were consistently associated with the disease.
Other minor fungi, such as Pythium,
Iridella, Fusarium, and Cylindrocarpon spp. (26), and certain rapidly growing gram-negative rod bacteria, have also been implicated in strawberry black root rot (9,25).
Affected plants typically exhibit stunting and necrotic centers. Leaves are smaller and the number of runners are reduced.
Affected roots can have blackened lesions that extend into the cortical tissue, leaving the stele white for a period of time. Le sions coalesce to blacken the whole root.
Cultivars that are resistant to black root rot are not available. Pre-plant fumigation may suppress black root rot in the year of planting, but typically does not offer any lasting control. Current control recommen dations are to avoid abiotic stresses, such as drought, winter injury, and heavy wet soils, and to use a two-year rotation with grains (4,26).
In New England, straw is used as a winter mulch for strawberries, so rotation with grains has been readily adopted by many growers to produce straw. However, rotation crops can vary in their susceptibil ity as hosts to R. fragariae and P. pene trans (14). Past research has demonstrated that ‘Saia’ oats (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and ‘Triple S’ sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense) were poor hosts of
R. fragariae and P. penetrans, whereas ‘Garry’ oats (Avena sativa L), rye (Secale cereale L), buckwheat (Fagopyrum es cultentum Moench), canola (Brassica napus L), or strawberries either increased or did not affect the population densities of the pathogens (14). Furthermore, Hilde brand and West (9,25) found that straw berry black root rot was increased follow ing particular rotation crops and was associated with elevated levels of fluo rescing and nonfluorescing gram-negative rod bacteria in the rhizosphere of straw berry.
Another control method for suppressing black root rot may be through management of mineral nutrition. In field studies, fer tilization with (NH4)2SO4 suppressed strawberry black root rot and increased leaf area, number of runners, and berry yields more than fertilization with Ca(NO3)2 (6).
Plants treated with (NH4)2SO4 had more N and Mn in the leaves than Ca(NO3)2 treated plants. Increased Mn availability has been implicated in disease resistance (12); therefore, (NH4)2SO4 may function in disease suppression by enhancing Mn up take. Furthermore, Mn-transforming mi croorganisms may be associated with black root rot as in other root diseases (12). An oat pre-crop can increase the availability of
Mn by affecting the number of Mn-oxi dizing or Mn-reducing bacteria, or both, in soil (12).
A combination of disease-suppressive rotation crops and disease-suppressive fertilizers may provide greater disease suppression than either practice alone. Our objectives were to compare the combined and individual effects of the cover crops (oat cvs. Saia and Garry and sorgho-su dangrass) with nitrogen fertilizers (NH4)2SO4 or Ca(NO3)2 on strawberry growth and nutrition, black root rot, and microbial changes in the rhizosphere.MATERIALS AND METHODS
Plot establishment and fertilizer treat ments. In July 1995, 48 microplots con sisting of polyvinyl chloride tubes (15-cm in diameter and 0.46 m long) were set 0.3 m deep in Windsor, Connecticut and filled with soil (Watchaug fine sandy loam, pH 5.9) that previously had been planted with strawberries and where symptoms of black root rot had been severe. Twelve micro plots were seeded with 10 to 15 seeds of oat cvs. Garry or Saia or sorgho-sudan ABSTRACT
Elmer, W. H., and LaMondia, J. A. 1999. Influence of ammonium sulfate and rotation crops on strawberry black root rot. Plant Dis. 83:119-123.
The combined effects of rotation crops and nitrogen fertilizers were examined on the strawberry black root rot disease complex. In July 1995, microplots were filled with soil that had a history of strawberry black root rot and seeded with two types of oats (Avena strigosa ‘Saia oats’ or A. sativa ‘Garry oats’) or with sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense ‘Triple S’). Microplots planted with 1-year-old ‘Honeoye’ strawberry crowns served as the controls. In May 1996, the crops were chopped and incorporated into the soil. The soil was re-planted with 1 year-old strawberry ‘Honeoye’ crowns and then fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 or Ca(NO3)2 at equivalent rates of N. Two months later, (NH4)2SO4-treated plants had 36% more leaf area and 41% more runners than strawberries treated with Ca(NO3)2. Strawberries that had been pre cropped with ‘Saia’ oats had 135% more runners and 38% more early fruit yield than strawber ries grown in control microplots. Total fruit yield was not affected by the treatments. Compared to Ca(NO3)2, the (NH4)2SO4 treatment reduced the percentage of blackened roots. The influence of the cover crops on growth and disease was stronger with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization than with
Ca(NO3)2 fertilization. Combining ‘Saia’ oats or sorgho-sudangrass rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization reduced lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) numbers in subsequent straw berry roots when compared to controls. Also, the combination of ‘Saia’ or ‘Garry’ oats as a pre crop with applications of (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot severity when compared to controls.
Only the ‘Garry’ oat rotation reduced strawberry root colonization by Rhizoctonia fragariae when compared to controls. Other effects were associated with using (NH4)2SO4. The (NH4)2SO4 treatment lowered the rhizosphere soil pH by 0.2 units, reduced the numbers of fluo rescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere by 10- to 15-fold, and produced leaves that had more
N, K, S, Mn, and Zn content than plants treated with Ca(NO3)2. Rotation with ‘Saia’ oats com bined with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization may suppress strawberry black root rot and increase yields through multiple effects on the host, pathogens, and associated microflora.

Of the 12 microplots that were seeded with the grasses, 6 were fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 at 50 kg of N/ha (0.06 g of N/microplot), and the other 6 were fertilized with
Ca(NO3)2 at 50 kg of N/ha. Microplots planted with strawberries received
Ca(NO3)2 or (NH4)2SO4 at 112 kg of N/ha (0.14 g of N/microplot). Phosphorous, K,
Ca, Mg, and S were applied to each plot at 45, 45, 30, and 45 kg/ha, respectively. Fer tilizers were dissolved in 50 ml of water and poured on top of the soil. Therefore, eight treatments (three cover crops plus the control × two nitrogen fertilizers) were applied to 48 microplots in a complete randomized blocked factorial design (two blocks; three replicates per block). The experiment was repeated in Hamden, Con necticut 1 week later.
In May 1996, cover crop residues or surviving strawberry crowns were chopped and incorporated into the soil with trowels.
Each plot was then planted with one 1 year-old ‘Honeoye’ strawberry crown.
Microplots that had been treated with
Ca(NO3)2 or (NH4)2SO4 in 1995 continued to receive the same nitrogen fertilizer in 1996. Each microplot received 85 kg of
N/ha (0.01 g of N/ microplot) at planting and 85 kg of N/ha in July 1996. All mi croplots received K, P, Ca, and S at the total seasons equivalent of 84, 84, 30, and 45 kg/ha, respectively. In May 1997, at 10% bloom, microplots received 10% of the total 1996 fertilizer rate. A total of 60% was applied at renovation on 25 July and the remaining 30% was applied on 9 Sep tember.
Sampling and measurements. In 1996, the treatment effects on black root rot and plant health were measured by counting the runners which were removed weekly in
June and July and by measuring leaf area (A) in late June and late July. Leaf area was determined by the equation: A = 3.02 + 1.77 L × W (R2 = 0.98), in which L and W are the length and width, respectively, of the middle leaflet of each strawberry leaf.
This equation was generated by regressing the products of the lengths and widths from 84 ‘Honeoye’ strawberry leaves against their leaf areas, which were determined on a leaf area meter (Delta-T Devices, Pull man, WA). In June 1997, berries were picked, counted, and weighed for a total of eight harvest dates. Early fruit harvests are more economically important than later pickings, so early yield was measured and defined as the total harvest from the first four pickings. Runners were not removed during the 1997 growing season, which is conventional for strawberry culture. In
September 1997, the microplots were re moved from the surrounding soil and the plant with its roots and soil were removed from each microplot. Loose soil was gently dislodged from the roots, after which the roots were vigorously shaken into plastics bags to sample the rhizosphere soil. The soil was immediately stored on ice until it could be refrigerated at 4°C. Plant tops and roots were separated just below the junc tion where the petioles are attached to the crown. The roots and plant tops were washed in tap water to remove soil, blotted dry between absorbent paper towels, and weighed. The foliar portions were oven dried and weighed.
Root systems were rated for black root rot by estimating the percentage of black ened roots. Roots were sampled for isola tion of the pathogens. From each root sys tem, 1-cm sections were cut from two young structural roots that emerged from the crown (crown roots), two blackened perennial roots that were devoid of feeder roots (main perennial roots), and two feeder roots. Root sections were washed in tap water, rinsed with distilled water, and placed on water agar. Plates were incu bated for 5 days at room temperature and microscopically examined (200× magnifi cation). Each root section was scored as being colonized by Rhizoctonia spp.,
Fusarium spp., Pythium spp., other fungi, or not colonized. Values were presented as percent root colonization. Lesion nema todes were extracted from roots by agitat ing 2 g of chopped roots (0.5 to 1 cm long) in water for 5 days, decanting the nema todes onto sieves, and counting the lesion nematodes under a microscope (1). Values were presented as number of lesion nema todes per g root.
Rhizosphere soil was serially diluted into sterile normal saline blanks. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of each dilution were spread onto 10% tryptic-soy agar plus 13.5 g/liter agar (Difco Laboratories, Inc., Detroit) in 10 cm-diameter petri plates to enumerate aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, King’s B agar for fluorescent pseudomonads, and
Mn-dioxide agar (5 g of Mn-dioxide, 30 g of sucrose, 1 g of Difco yeast extract, 15 g of agar) for Mn-reducing bacteria. Three plates of each media per dilution were prepared and incubated in the dark for 2 to 3 days at 25°C. Soil moisture was deter mined independently. For total bacteria, 10% tryptic-soy agar plates that contained between 30 and 300 colonies were counted, averaged over the three plates, and expressed as log colonies of bacteria/g soil (oven dry weight equivalent). Fluores cent pseudomonads were enumerated by viewing King’s B agar under shortwave
UV light 2 days later. Mn-reducing bacte ria were detected 2 weeks later on Mn dioxide agar by the zones of clearing that appeared around the colony. Fluorescent pseudomonads and Mn-reducers were expressed as log densities/g soil (oven dry weight equivalent).
Tissue analyses. The leaf samples col lected in 1996 were dried to constant weights at 50°C and ground to powder in a mortar with a pestle. Dried tissue (1 g) from the three replicate plants in one block were bulked, and 1 g of dried tissue from three plants in the other block were bulked.
Dried tissue (0.5 g) from these two bulked samples was digested with 5 ml of HCl and 10 ml of HNO3 in a CEM MDS 81D mi crowave (CEM Co. Matthews, NC). Sam ples were brought up to 50 ml with deion ized water. The elements K, P, Ca, Mg, S,
Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B were quantified by plasma spectrophometry on a Thermo Jar rell Atom Scan spectrophotometer and expressed as µmol/g dry weight. Nitrogen was determined using the Kjeldahl proce dure. Leaf tissue (0.25 g) from the two bulked samples were heated and digested in 4 ml of H2SO4 and 10 ml of H2O2 and analyzed colorimetrically for total N. Val ues were averaged and presented as µmol/g dry weight.
Statistical procedures. Data were sub jected to analysis of variance for a blocked factorial design. Since there were no sig nificant interactions between the treat ments and the Hamden site or with the
Windsor site at P = 0.05, values from both sites were combined for analysis and pres entation. Mean separation was done using the Student-Newman-Keul Test at P = 0.05.RESULTS
Differences in leaf area were found in 
July 1996 (Table 1), but not in June (data not shown). Plants fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 had 36% more leaf area (P = 0.02) and 41% more runners (P = 0.02) than plants treated with Ca(NO3)2. Pre cropping with ‘Saia’ oats led to a 135% increase in runners (P = 0.04) when com pared to continuous strawberry culture. In
June 1997, early berry yields were greater from plants pre-cropped with Saia oats than controls (P = 0.04). Total yield was not significantly affected, but the trends reflected the same pattern observed with the early yield. The nitrogen fertilizers did not affect yield. In September 1997, the fresh weights of roots of the strawberry plants pre-cropped with Saia oats and treated with (NH4)2SO4 were larger than any other treatment combination (P = 0.05). In addition, fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 produced plants that were 17% larger than those fertilized with Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.05). Pre-cropping the soil with Saia oats produced strawberry plants that had more dry weight than controls (P < 0.001).
We calculated a fresh root weight to fresh top weight ratio to assess the treatment effects on distribution of plant weight.
Treatment with Ca(NO3)2 yielded plants with root systems that weighed proportion ately less than their tops when compared to plants fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 (P = 0.05).
There was an significant interaction between the two oat cover crops and (NH4)2SO4 fertilization in reducing the percentage of blackened roots when com 
Plant Disease / February 1999  121 pared to other treatments (P = 0.01; Table 2). There were also fewer blackened roots on plants treated with (NH4)2SO4 when compared to Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.01). Rhizoc tonia spp. were isolated from the straw berry roots 68% of the time, whereas
Fusarium and Pythium spp. were detected only 7.4 and 0.8% of the time, respec tively (data not shown). Of the three classes of roots, the perennial main roots were most colonized by Rhizoctonia spp., followed by feeder roots and then crown roots. Plants pre-cropped with ‘Garry’ oats had less colonization of feeder roots and main perennial roots by Rhizoctonia spp.
than roots from the control treatment (P = 0.05). The roots of strawberries that were pre-cropped with Saia oats or with sorgho sudangrass and then treated with (NH4)2SO4 had 66 or 51% fewer nema todes, respectively, than controls treated with (NH4)2SO4 (P = 0.001). Lesion nematode numbers did not differ between strawberries that were pre-copped with
Garry oats and control strawberries. Lesion nematodes were recovered in greater den sities from roots treated with (NH4)2SO4 than with Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.001).
The rhizosphere pH in soil treated with (NH4)2SO4 was 4.81, compared to 5.08 for
Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.001), but there were no differences between the cover crops (Table 3). The rhizosphere soil of (NH4)2SO4 treated plants had a 10- to 15-fold reduc tion in the number of fluorescent pseudo monads when compared to Ca(NO3)2 treated rhizosphere soil (P < 0.001). Total heterotrophic bacteria and Mn-reducing microbes were not affected by the treat ments.
The mineral composition of the straw berry leaves sampled in September 1996 did not significantly differ between the two sites except for the elements N, K, Mg, and
S, which were in greater concentration in
Windsor than in Hamden. Since there were no interactions between site and treat ments, values from both sites were com bined for analysis and presentation (Table 4). Leaf concentrations of N, K, S, and Zn in plants treated with (NH4)2SO4 were significantly increased by 7 to 30%, while
Mn levels were significantly increased by 103% compared to those fertilized with
Ca(NO3)2. Sorgho-sudangrass and both oat species increased the leaf concentration of
Ca and Mg when compared to controls plants.DISCUSSION
Combining Saia oats as a single season rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization pro duced larger strawberry plants, more early yield, and less damage from black root rot than if Saia oats were combined with
Ca(NO3)2 or if another rotation crop was combined with the (NH4)2SO4 treatment.
Rotating strawberry with sorgho-sudan grass and fertilizing with (NH4)2SO4 re duced lesion nematodes but did not affect disease severity or yield. Similarly, Garry oats reduced disease severity and root colonization by R. fragariae but did not increase plant growth or yield. Huber and

 122  Plant Disease / Vol. 83 No. 2 with oats and fertilizing with NH4-N as being suppressive to take-all of wheat. Our findings support the hypothesis that com bining rotation with oats with NH4-N fer tilization can reduce root diseases in plants.
Both oat cultivars suppressed black root rot under the (NH4)2SO4 regime but dif fered in their effect on the two main patho gens. Saia oats reduced the number of root lesion nematodes but did not affect root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. Garry oats reduced root colonization by Rhizoc tonia spp. but did not affect the numbers of lesion nematodes. Furthermore, the Saia oat pre-crop increased early berry yield but
Garry oats had no effect. The early yield increase following rotation with Saia oats may have been due to its unsuitability as a host for the lesion nematode which, in these soils, may have been a more yield reducing pathogen. In other experiments, we have found that Saia oats were similar in effect to Garry oats in reducing R. fra gariae recovery from soil (14; J. A. LaMondia, unpublished research). There fore, the failure of Garry oats to affect yield may have been its high susceptibility to the lesion nematode. The resistance of
Saia oats to the lesion nematode was first recognized by Colbran (3), who found that it was useful in suppressing the re-plant problem in apple orchards. Townsend (24) later showed that Saia oats were resistant to Pratylenchus neglectus Rensch and P. penetrans. However, the resistance to le sion nematode does not completely explain the effect of Saia oats on disease and yield because sorgho-sudangrass also reduced the number of lesion nematodes but had no significant effect on disease severity or yield. It is possible the reduction in nema tode densities by sorgho-sudangrass was insufficient to have an effect on yield. It is also possible that oat straw residues may have specific effects on the disease. Pa pavizas (18) reported that oat (presumably
A. sativa) straw residues increased the number of antagonistic bacteria to R. so lani and to other fungal pathogens in soil.
Since we did not examine antagonism, it is unclear whether or not the residues of
Avena spp. act differently toward soil mi crobes than those of sorgho-sudangrass.
The association of Rhizoctonia spp. with strawberry roots extends from being my corrhizal to being pathogenic (19). Past studies with this same soil type found nearly all isolates of Rhizoctonia from strawberry roots were members of the virulent anastomosis groups, AG-A, AG
G, and AG-I of binucleate R. fragariae (17). The very low frequency of isolating
Pythium or Fusarium spp. suggests that, in these soils, they were not a significant factor in the black root rot complex.
Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 led to more disease suppression and more plant growth than with Ca(NO3)2, but yield was not af fected. In past studies, (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot and increased yield in straw berry (6) and suppressed root diseases on other crops (5,10,11). Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 did not affect the recovery of
Rhizoctonia spp. from roots but did in crease root weight and the number of le sion nematodes. Because P. penetrans is an obligate parasite and must live in living roots, it may not be unreasonable to find lower densities of this pathogen on roots of dead and declining strawberries, as evi denced in the Ca(NO3)2-treated plants, than on larger, healthier (NH4)2SO4-treated plants.
The increase in mineral composition in (NH4)2SO4-treated plants compared to
Ca(NO3)2-treated plants has been observed before (5,6). The doubling of the Mn con

Plant Disease / February 1999  123 tent, however, was striking. Manganese may be associated with disease suppression in strawberry (6) and other plants (5,10,11,22). Manganese may increase synthesis of host defense products, reduce the virulence of the pathogens, and affect the biological suppression of the pathogen (11,12,22). We hypothesized that the oat cultivars might increase availability of Mn via microbial transformations. However, we found no detectable effect between any of the rotation crops on Mn-reducing or ganisms. The acidification of the rhizo sphere in (NH4)2SO4-treated plants proba bly played a major role in increasing Mn availability. The putative role of Mn in disease needs to be deciphered.
Hildebrand and West (9,25) found that diseased strawberry roots were associated with rapidly growing fluorescent and non fluorescent gram-negative groups of bacte ria. However, when black root rot was suppressed by rotation, they found that these bacterial groups were replaced by slow-growing bacteria (25). We found no effect of cover crops on microbial densities in the rhizosphere, but we observed that the fast-growing fluorescent pseudo monads were 10 to 15 times more abun dant in the rhizosphere of the more dis eased Ca(NO3)2-treated plants than in the rhizosphere of plants treated with (NH4)2SO4. The role of these bacteria in black root rot is unclear. Pseudomonads are common exploiters of the rhizosphere and root and can be associated with root dam age (21). Future investigations should de termine if these bacteria are involved with black root rot and how fertilization affects their proliferation in the rhizosphere.ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
