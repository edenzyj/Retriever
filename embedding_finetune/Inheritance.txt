Abstract. Two half diallel mating designs were conducted to study the inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds on runners of strawberry. The main design included six genotypes representing a range of responses to the pathogen: ‘Chan dler’ (very susceptible); FL 87-210 (tolerant); MS/US 541 (very resistant); NC 92-01 (Fragaria chiloensis Duch.) (resistant); NCH 87-10 (tolerant-susceptible); and NCC 89-39 (susceptible). The cross ‘Chandler’ x MS/US 541 was absent. The secondary test included ‘Chandler’ and selections FL 87-210 and NC 85-01 (Fragaria virginiana Duch.) (very resistant) as parents. Griffing’s methods 4 and 2, model I, were used to test for combining ability in the main and secondary tests, respectively. General combining ability and specific combining ability were highly significant in all analyses. This study indicated that nonadditive effects are more important than additive effects in the inheritance of resis tance of runners to anthracnose. The frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies suggests that resistance to C. acutatum on runners is quantitative. Therefore, breeding for resistance should be accomplished using progeny testing followed by indi vidual selection within progenies.

Inheritance of resistance to anthracnose in strawberry has been addressed by only a few authors. Gupton and Smith (1991) evaluated progenies of 40 parents crossed in a Comstock and Robinson Design II Mating scheme to determine the relative importance of the dif ferent components of genetic variance in the inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum spp. Petiole inoculation was used for disease rating. Estimates of dominance variance were 6–10 times higher than those for additive variance. Epistatic variance accounted for 35% to 38% of the total genetic variance. The frequency distribution of disease severity “ratings” appeared to be bimodal, suggesting major gene action may also be involved. Broad sense heritability estimates were 0.87 and 0.85 and narrow sense heritability estimates were 0.37 and 0.26 for females and males respec tively, which indicates the possibility of ge netic gain from recurrent selection. Faedi and
De Clauser (1991) and Winterbottom et al.
(1991), working with selections and commer cial cultivars, reported that plant resistance to
C. acutatum appeared to be conferred by a major gene. Neither of these studies specified which isolates (races) of C. acutatum were used in screening for resistance. In the latter study, runner inoculation was utilized. The inheritance of resistance was determined by screening parents, S1 and reciprocal F1 prog enies obtained from crosses between sus ceptible and resistant parents. This inconclu sive information about resistance to anthra cnose justifies more research. There is no information in the literature about estimates of combining ability for resistance to Colleto trichum acutatum. This study was undertaken to obtain more information about inheritance of resistance and estimates of general and specific combining ability in the resistance to
C. acutatum on runners of strawberry.Materials and Methods 
Plant material. Six parents that varied in reaction to C. acutatum were crossed in a half diallel design and the resulting progenies were used in this experiment. The parents included in the main test were F. ×ananassa genotypes, except where indicated and included: MS/US 541 (very resistant), NC 92-01 (F. chiloensis) (resistant), FL 87-210 (resistant-tolerant), NCH 87-10 (tolerant-susceptible), NCC 89-39 (sus ceptible-tolerant), and ‘Chandler’ (very sus ceptible). The F. chiloensis parent (NC 92-01) originated as an open-pollinated seedling from a mixed planting of collected wild clones of the species on a farm near Panguipulli, Chile. The total number of crosses was 15 [equal to p (p-1)/2, with p being the number of parents].
Due to a mistake in handling the seeds, the cross ‘Chandler’ x MS/US 541 was improp erly labeled. Therefore, it was eliminated from the analyses and its effects were considered equal to zero in the combining ability analysis.
In a secondary test, the only cross combina tions successfully accomplished were with the parents NC 85-01 (F. virginiana) (very resis tant), FL 87-210 (resistant-tolerant), and ‘Chan dler’ (very susceptible). NC 85-01 originated from open-pollinated seed collected from a wild F. virginiana population in Wake County,
N.C. Crosses were made during Spring 1994; and five hundred seeds from each cross were put under mist in 13-cm pots on sand in a greenhouse in Dec. 1994. Once seedlings reached the two true leaf stage, they were transplanted to 40-cell plug trays containing peat substrate (Fafard Mix No.4-P; Conrad
Fafard, Agawam, Mass.) and placed on green house benches. Dates of transplanting de pended on the rate of plant development, be ginning on 25 Jan. and finishing on 20 Feb. 1995. A total of 80 seedlings from each cross and 25 plants from each parent were trans planted. Plants were watered daily and fertil ized weekly with 20–20–20 (3 g·L–1 of water) to ensure proper growth and enhance runner formation. Flowers were completely removed from parent plants to avoid competition with runners. Seedlings were inoculated when they were ≈4 months old and runners were at least 15 cm long. Seedlings and plants of the parents were grown in the Horticulture Greenhouse facilities on the North Carolina State Univ. (NCSU) campus, Raleigh. 
Inoculation. Milholland’s technique was used to screen progeny and parents for resistance to anthracnose (Ballington and

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp.
is one of the most important factors limiting strawberry production in many southeastearn states of the United States (Ballington and
Milholland, 1993); and became a problem in
North Carolina during the mid-1970s.
Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds is now the main cause of anthracnose in North Carolina (Grand et al., 1990; Smith and Black, 1985).
The genetics of resistance to anthracnose is complicated. Differential reactions of culti vars over time and across locations have been found by several authors (Ballington and
Milholland, 1993; Delp and Milholland, 1980;
Smith and Black, 1985). This behavior could be explained by the existence of races (iso lates) and differences in pathogenicity and virulence within each of the Colletotrichum species, by the presence of vertical and hori zontal resistance, and by the presence of sig nificant cultivar × isolate interactions (Ballington and Milholland, 1993; Delp and 6797, p. 686-690 6/26/02, 3:21 PM686 687HORTSCIENCE, VOL. 37(4), JULY 2002 
Milholland, 1993). The most virulent isolate of C. acutatum (CA-1) evaluated in a previous study (Ballington and Milholland, 1993) was grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium in petri dishes for 10 d at room temperature (25 °C) under continuous fluorescent light.
Conidia were washed from the surface of the colony, filtered through cheese cloth and sus pended in sterile distilled water. Two drops per liter of the surfactant Tween 20 were added to the conidial suspension. Concentration of the inoculum was adjusted with a hemato cytometer to 1 × 106 conidia/mL. Runners of the seedlings were carefully sprayed to runoff using a hand sprayer. Once the inoculum dried, inoculated plants were placed in a wet chamber at 28 °C and 100% relative humidity for 48 h and then returned to a greenhouse held be tween 21 and 28 °C. Twenty seedlings of each cross and 5 plants of each parent were inocu lated each time and the test was repeated four times during Summer 1995 (80 plants/cross; 25 plants/parent). Disease development in each of two runners/plant was recorded 11 d after inoculation. A total of 1280 seedlings from crosses and 175 plants of the parents were screened for resistance, including the main and secondary tests with four replications. In oculations and incubation in the moist chamber were conducted at the Castle Hayne Research
Station, Castle Hayne, N.C. Incubation and disease readings were done in the Horticulture
Greenhouses on the NCSU Campus. 
Disease index. Disease severity was rated according to the length of lesion development on the runner: 0.0–1.9 cm = resistant; 2.0–2.9 cm = intermediate; and >3.0 cm = susceptible (Ballington and Milholland, 1993).
Statistics. Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using the general linear mod els procedure (PROC GLM, SAS Institute,
Cary, N.C.). Estimates of general and specific combining ability were determined using the standard methodology for analyzing data from diallel crosses (Griffing, 1956). Method 4, model I (fixed) based on F1’s , and Method 2, model I (fixed), based on parents and F1’s (half diallel) was used for the analysis of main and secondary test respectively. These methods and models for combining ability analysis were selected because of the characteristics of the experiments of this study (i.e. a reduced number of parents were used without recipro cal crosses). When a limited number of parents are evaluated (<10) and the selection of these parents cannot be considered random, then a fixed model is recommended (Baker, 1978;
Christie and Shattuck, 1992). Griffing’s analy sis of combining ability requires no special (genetic) assumptions beyond those necessary for the ANOVA and has been used to convey reliable information on the combining poten tial of parents (Baker, 1978; Christie and
Shattuck, 1992). Baker (1978) concluded that diallel analyses should be used only to esti mate combining ability, and to attempt to interpret diallel statistics in terms of compo nents of genetic variance is subject to failure in either of both assumptions of independent distribution of genes in the parent and absence of epistasis, unless parents have been pro duced by a process of random mating and nonselective inbreeding.Results and Discussion 
Main test. The ANOVA for the main test showed highly significant differences among genotypes (Table 1). The general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were highly significant (Table 1), suggesting that additive and non additive effects were involved in the inherit ance of resistance to isolate CA-1 of C. acutatum on runners in these populations.
Parent means for mean lesion length con firmed the resistance designations of these parental genotypes (Table 2). GCA effects for the parents refers to the average performance of a parent in hybrid combinations (Baker, 1978; Griffing, 1956; Sprague and Tatum, 1941) (Table 2). Negative values of GCA for a parent indicate that the hybrids involving that particular parent had shorter lesion lengths than the average of all hybrids. In contrast, positive values of GCA for a parent indicate that the hybrids of this parent had longer lesions than the average of all hybrids. Those parents with high negative GCA value repre sent a useful source for runner resistance. This resistance is very important to prevent plant and fruit infection in the field (Ballington and
Milholland, 1993). Therefore, based on GCA the best parents for resistance were MS/US 541 and FL 87-210. The highest GCA for susceptibility was recorded for ‘Chandler’.
The SCA for mean lesion length of each hybrid combination measured whether the performance of a progeny is superior or infe rior than the average performance of the par ents involved (Table 3) (Sprague and Tatum, 1941; Griffing, 1956; Baker, 1978). There fore, a negative value of SCA for a particular combination indicates a shorter mean lesion length for that progeny than would be ex pected based on the average performance of the parents. Overall, there did not appear to be much relationship between SCA values and the number of resistant seedlings (Table 3).
The largest deviation from expected for shorter mean lesion was obtained with NCH 87-10 x
NCC 89-39 and FL 87-210 x NC 92-01. Thus, these crosses are good hybrid combinations for runner resistance to anthracnose.
These two progenies also had the shortest mean lesion lengths, however, this did not translate into higher numbers of resistant seed lings than in the other parental combinations.
The largest deviation for longer mean lesion was observed on FL 87-210 x NCC 89-39 and
Chandler x NCH 87-10 crosses. Again, one of these crosses, FL 87-210 x NCC 89-39, per formed quite well for number of resistant seedlings in spite of high positive SCA and mean lesion length.
Secondary test. The ANOVA for the half diallel design using only ‘Chandler’, FL 87 210 and NC 85-01 also showed highly significant differences among genotypes (data not shown—for details see Giménez, 1997).
Both GCA and SCA mean squares were highly

BREEDING, CULTIVARS, ROOTSTOCKS, & GERMPLASM RESOURCES significant, and GCA variance was much greater than SCA variance. However, the small number of parents probably influenced the results, especially SCA effects. Small partial diallels give reasonable GCA esti mates but are less efficient in detecting SCA effects (Dhillon and Singh, 1978), and are subject to large sampling errors (Christie and
Shattuck, 1992). Based on GCA effects, NC 85-01 (GCA = –1.65) appeared to be a superior parent for reduced lesion length, and the com bination, NC 85-01 x FL 87-210, yielded twice as many resistant seedlings (30 out of 90) as the best of any other combination (Table 3).

Overall, these results emphasize the im portance of additive and nonadditive variance in the inheritance of resistance to anthracnose caused by C. acutatum on strawberry runners, which agrees with Gupton and Smith’s (1991) conclusions. The GCA/SCA variance ratio can be useful to compare the relative impor tance of the variance components. A relatively high ratio suggests the importance of additive gene effects, a low one implies the presence of nonadditive (dominant, epistatic, or both) gene effects (Griffing, 1956). In the main experi ment, although both combining abilities were significant, the SCA mean square was greater than GCA mean square, suggesting that non additive inheritance is important for anthra cnose resistance. Various authors have re ported that nonadditive variance is important for several horticultural characteristics of strawberry, including disease resistance (Aalders and Craig, 1968; Comstock et al., 1958; Hansche et al., 1968; Spangelo et al., 1971; Watkins and Spangelo, 1971; Watkins et al., 1970). This fact should be considered in breeding for resistance to anthracnose on run ners of strawberry. When nonadditive vari ance is present, the most appropriate breeding method is the one that exploits all the genetic 6797, p. 686-690 6/26/02, 3:21 PM688 689HORTSCIENCE, VOL. 37(4), JULY 2002 variance (Watkins and Spangelo, 1968). This could be accomplished by evaluating a large number of parental combinations (progeny testing) for identification and selection of the best combinations for resistance to anthra cnose. In a second phase, these best crosses should be grown on a larger scale to select the best genotypes among them. Recombination of the best selections can also be done to obtain improved populations. Selection in a breeding program usually involves considering several characteristics, therefore, the best crosses should combine anthracnose resistance with other desirable horticultural traits.

Nature of gene action. The frequency distribution of lesion lengths for representa tive progenies indicate that variation was continuous (Figs. 1 and 2). Therefore, resis tance to anthracnose caused by isolate CA-1 of
C. acutatum on strawberry runners appears to be quantitative in nature. This differs from previous studies (Gupton and Smith, 1991;
Faedi and De Clauser, 1991; Winterbottom et al., 1991), where major gene action was sug gested for inheritance of resistance. It should be noted that mating scheme, method of genetic analysis, parents and isolate of C. acutatum used in this study were different from the previous ones, which could have led to differ ent results.Conclusions 
The results of this study indicate that non additive and additive effects are important in the inheritance of resistance of strawberry runners to C. acutatum. However, since the estimate of SCA variance was greater than
GCA variance, nonadditive inheritance ap pears to be more important. The frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies suggests that the inheritance of resistance to C. 6797, p. 686-690 6/26/02, 3:21 PM689

Therefore, genetic progress for anthra cnose resistance can be made using progeny testing for selection of the best parental com binations followed by individual selection within the best progenies.Literature Cited
