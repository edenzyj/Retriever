Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry: discovery history, global diversity, prevalence in China, and the host range of top two species
Ying Ji1,2  , Xue Li1,2, Qing‑Hua Gao2*  , Chunnv Geng1 and Ke Duan2*   Abstract 
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species, is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry produc‑ tion worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, being ancient and co‑evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the top ten economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since it was first reported in United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In a sense, to produce organic strawberry is impracticable largely because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry have been widely characterized. The review focused on providing an accurate inventory of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry via revisiting the discovery history scrupulously over 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa were accepted as strawberry pathogens with global occurrence illustrated. The relative preva‑ lence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry was systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the prevailing C. fructicola and C. siamense, also the top two Colletotrichum species causing serious dam‑ ages on the earth was summarized, with a goal of diagnosing accurately and improving anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystem.

An introduction to Colletotrichum spp. and strawberry anthracnose
The genus Colletotrichum has been considered as one of the global top 10 important genera of fungal pathogens (Dean et  al. 2012). Indeed, Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus on the earth and has co-evolved with flower ing plants. The plant microfossils of Protocolletotri chum preserved on an angiosperm leaf cuticle suggest that the diversified pathogenic strategies have been well established in Colletotrichum spp. from the Late Creta ceous onwards (Kar et  al. 2004). Different complexes in the genus Colletotrichum might diverge between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al. 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments boosted the further diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have diversified to adapt to thousands of hosts, occurring as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et  al. 1998; Dean et  al. 2012; Hirayama et  al. 2018; da Silva et al. 2020; Jayawardena et al. 2020). Currently, a total of 257 Colletotrichum species grouped into 15 complexes and 13 additional singletons have been accepted in this Open Access

Page 2 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42 genus, with C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (s.l., complex, aggregate) and C. acutatum s.l. being the top two com plexes consisting of 57 and 41 species, respectively (Tal hinhas and Baroncelli 2021).
Rosaceae has been reported as the top plant family with most records of association with Colletotrichum genus, hosting as many as 41 Colletotrichum species (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Postharvest fruit rot, Glomerella leaf spot, and pre-mature defoliation are common symp toms caused by Colletotrichum fungi on apple (Zhang et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2022), pear (Fu et al. 2019), peach (Tan et  al. 2022), strawberry (Eaton et  al. 2021; Wang et  al. 2022), and many other rosaceous plants (Dowling et  al. 2020). Among these Rosaceae crops, strawberry is most vulnerable to fungal diseases with a short plant stature and soft berry without protective skin. One Colle totrichum species could infect all organs of strawberry (Adhikari et  al. 2019). Anthracnose has been a limiting factor for the ecological and sustainable development of strawberry production, posing a serious and continu ing threat to strawberry security (Zhang et  al. 2012). In particular, anthracnose crown rot holds a destructive influence on strawberry remarkably higher than other diseases. The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot is attributable to that Colletotrichum spp. could kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tis sue with a long latent period without symptom visible, no long-term effective fungicides available, and diverse ori gins of the causal agents unpredictable (Peres et al. 2017; 
Forcelini and Peres 2018; Hirayama et al. 2018). In addi tion, Colletotrichum spp. on asymptomatic plants can be dispersed by transportation over long distance, whereas relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are absent in China. 
The prerequisite for disease control is to recognize the causal agents. Originally, identification of the causal agents largely relied on morphological observation and virulence test. Repeated subculture of microbes in  vitro might alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics vary with the choice of host or environmental conditions forms a serious con cern in fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks 1931). Via using PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, scientists revealed the genetic delimitation among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberry, and sorted those patho gens of worldwide origins into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Martínez-Culebras et  al. 2000, 2003). Still, doubtfully annotated data for Colletotrichum species were frequent in GenBank and full of confusions (Nilsson et  al. 2006; Hyde et  al. 2009). Later, the emer gency of multi-locus phylogeny provides a decisive help for the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists greatly expanded the knowledge of Colle totrichum systematics (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a, b; Weir et al. 2012), setting solid basis for future research. A landmark work corrected many synonymous names and provided a valuable reference for understand ing Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et  al. 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and description of new species keep on proceeding with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jaya wardena et al. 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al. 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).
To detect Colletotrichum pathogen, especially the asymptomatic latent infection could avoid the spread of pathogen and prevent severe outbreak of anthracnose in strawberry fields. DNA microarray (Furuta et  al. 2017), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Wu et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021) and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay (Yang et al. 2022) were developed to detect 
Colletotrichum spp. for disease management in straw berry fields, although the targets of detection supposed to certain species complex were not clearly validated in those reports. A complete delineation of Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberry is not only crucial for strawberry health managers and government quarantine personnels, but also provide basic information for straw berry breeders aiming to improve resistance.
Despite intensive researches already contributed to understanding Colletotrichum genus pathogenic to strawberry, there is as yet short of an accurate inventory of these causal agents, and the pathogen population and prevalence of strawberry-virulent Colletotrichum spp. have not been systematically investigated in a large pro ducer such as China. To meet with these gaps, current review seeks to first sum up the biodiversity of Colletotri chum spp. pathogenic to strawberry via going through the global discovery history. Thereafter, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry in 
China was analyzed with data available. Finally, we sorted the host range of top two predominant species caus ing strawberry crown rot. Together, such knowledge has important applications for biosecurity risk manage ment (for example, proper estimation of the risk involved in strawberry seedling trade), accurate diagnosis, and anthracnose control, further sets a basis for systemati cally managing Colletotrichum genera in agricultural eco systems not only for strawberry industry.
The diversity of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberry: a historical perspective
From a historic perspective, revealing the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose has gone through many con fusions at the species level for a long period, gradu ally from a coarse estimate to fine identification along 
Page 3 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42  with the taxonomic placement of some species revised and novel species revealed. As far as we know, the first report was the infection of strawberry by C. fragariae in southeastern USA more than 90 years ago (Brooks 1931) (Fig. 1). Based on a morphological observation, it’s hard to distinguish C. fragariae from C. gloeosporioides, which had been described in the nineteenth century for the pathogen isolated from citrus in Italy (Penzig 1882). 
Therefore, in most cases strawberry anthracnose at early stage was believed to be caused by C. fragariae or C. gloe osporioides. A milestone occurred as the separation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides when the former was described as the causal agent of strawberry fruit rot in Australia (Simmonds 1965).
In 1980s, it was suggested that C. gloeosporioides was the same as C. fragariae on strawberry (Howard 1983; 
Smith and Black 1987). Although many pathologists tried to draw distinctions among C. fragariae, C. gloeospori oides, and C. acutatum (Smith and Black 1990; Gunnell and Gubler 1992), the discrimination of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose based on morphology remained obscure. During the last decade of the twentieth cen tury, strawberry anthracnose became a global disease. A primer CgInt targeting the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal gene was supposed to be specific to C. gloeosporioides (Mills et  al. 1992), which was used for a long time for strawberry anthracnose diag nosis even until 2015 (Rahman et al. 2015). At the end of the twentieth century, molecular tools were widely availa ble. Accordingly, the highly genetic diversity was revealed within C. acutatum (Buddie et  al. 1999; Martínez-Cule bras et  al. 2000, 2003; Denoyes-Rothan et  al. 2003) C. gloeosporioides (Suzuki et  al. 2010). Subsequently, C. boninense was separated from C. gloeosporioides (Mori waki et al. 2003; Damm et al. 2012b). C. simmondii was re-assessed as a member of C. acutatum s.l. (Shivas and 
Tan 2009). C. theobromicola, synonymous with C. fragar iae, was described as a member of the C. gloeosporioides complex with wide host range in tropical and subtropical regions (Rojas et al. 2010; Weir et al. 2012). In addition, strains formerly named after C. truncatum were re-iden tified as C. lineola (Damm et al. 2009), which were con fused for their similarly curved conidia (Sato et al. 2015).
In 2012, there occurred a race to learn more about the genetic boundaries within Colletotrichun spp. Based on analysis of multi-locus phylogeny, previous inaccurate synonymies were distinguished and a new era boosted the understanding of Colletotrichum. Species within the 
C. gloeosporioides complex were reliably distinguished on the basis of multi-gene phylogenies including ITS, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase-encod ing gene (GAPDH), calmodulin-encoding gene (CAL), 
Fig. 1  A timeline of reports about Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry. Years for reports (in brackets) and original sampling (if available) were indicated, and abbreviations of geographic locations (if specific) were shown for pathogen origins. Relevant findings of mycologists (unshaded) and strawberry pathologists (shaded) were sequentially marked on the central time axis not to scale. Early reports not distinguished at the species level were indicated in gray boxes. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species currently accepted were illustrated in distinct colors, which include orange for nine species of C. gloeosporioides s.l., light blue for seven of C. acutatum s.l., yellow for two of C. dematium s.l., light green for two of C. boninense s.l., and dark green for one of C. truncatum s.l., respectively, as well as two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. s.l. and s.s indicate sensu lato (complex) and sensu stricto, respectively 
Page 4 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42 actin-encoding gene (ACT ), and chitin synthase-encod ing gene (CHS) (Weir et  al. 2012). Multi-loci phyloge netic analysis using ITS, GAPDH, ACT , CHS, histone 3 (HIS3), and beta-tubulin (TUB2) clearly delimited vari ous species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et  al. 2012a). C. fructicola (from USA and Canada), C. siamense (from USA), and C. theobromicola (from USA) of the C. gloeosporioides complex were formally accepted as strawberry pathogens (Weir et al. 2012). In addition to 
C. simmondii (from Australia) (Shivas and Tan 2009), five additional species of the C. acutatum complex including 
C. acutatum sensu stricto (s.s.), C. fioriniae (from USA, 
UK, and New Zealand), C. godeiae (widely in Europe), 
C. nymphaeae (from USA, Israel, and Europe), C. sali cis (from New Zealand) were classified as distinct causal agents of strawberry anthracnose (Damm et  al. 2012a). 
Furthermore, C. miaoliense (isolated from crown and leaf tissues) of the C. acutatum complex was recognized to infect strawberry in Taiwan Province, China, although with weak virulence (Chung et  al. 2020). So far, a total of seven species of the C. acutatum complex have been known as strawberry pathogens.
C. aenigma of the C. gloeosporioides complex was reported to infect strawberry in UK (Baroncelli et  al. 2015). C. gloeosporioides s.s. was isolated from diseased strawberry leaf, petiole, and stolon in Hubei Province, 
China, where C. murrayae was also reported as a causal agent of the disease (Han et al. 2016). In the same year, C. murrayae was proved to be conspecific with C. siamense (Liu et  al. 2016). Two isolates from diseased strawberry (rhizome) in northern China were identified as a novel species named after C. changpingense of the C. gloe osporioides complex (Jayawardena et  al. 2016a). Within the same species complex, C. alienum (from Australia) was reported as strawberry pathogen (Shivas et al. 2016) 
C. kahawae was first reported from diseased strawberry in Chiba, Japan (Gan et  al. 2017). An additional species 
C. viniferum of the C. gloeosporioides complex was first reported to infect strawberry leaves in Shandong Prov ince, China (He et al. 2019). Hereto, a total of nine spe cies of the C. gloeosporioides complex have been reported to be pathogenic to strawberry.
In addition to species of the C. acutatum and C. gloe osporioides complexes, C. dematium was reported to be virulent to strawberry in USA nearly 50 years ago (Beraha and Wright 1973), which was again reported to infect strawberry in India (Singh et  al. 2003). Later, C. dema tium was accepted as a species complex with curved conidia, and C. lineola of this complex was isolated from diseased strawberry in Canada (Damm et al. 2009). 
C. dematium s.s. was again reported to be virulent to strawberry in India (Sharma et al. 2013). In addition, C. boninense s.s. of the C. boninense complex was reported to cause strawberry fruit rot in Lou-Di, Hunan Province, 
China (Bi et al. 2017a) C. karstii of the same complex was revealed to infect strawberry leaves in Taiwan Province, 
China (Chung et al. 2020). Besides, C. truncatum s.s. was isolated from diseased strawberry in Changping District, 
Beijing (Bi et al. 2017b). Hitherto, at least five Colletotri chum species from three additional complexes beyond C. acutatum s.l. and C. gloeosporioides s.l. have been known to be associated with strawberry.
Apart from these species from distinct complexes, there are two singleton species of Colletotrichum genus, which were not clustered with other species of any com plex (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021) but reported to infect strawberry. Typical strain of C. nigrum from Fra garia spp. petiole (UK) was previously reported in a work to circumscribe distinct anthracnose pathogens of several crops (Liu et al. 2013). C. coccodes causing straw berry fruit rot was reported in Australia (Shivas et  al. 2016). Indeed, these two singletons were phylogenetically close to each other (Liu et al. 2013).
In addition, C. paranaense of the C. acutatum com plex once was suggested to be associated with Fragaria in Australia (Moreira et  al. 2019), but no additional record of C. paranense virulent to strawberry is available. 
When examined with the barcodes of that potential C. paranaense strain from strawberry (Moreira et al. 2019) in GenBank, it was found to be a strain of C. simmond sii from Europe (data omitted). Indeed, C. paranaense has been considered as an endemism associated with apple, peach, and nectarine from Brazil only (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Recently, in an effort to reveal the causal agent of strawberry crown rot in USA, C. clidem iae was isolated from strawberry fields together with C. siamense (86%), C. theobromicola, and C. fructicola, but 
C. clidemiae was suggested as the only species not patho genic to strawberry (Oliveira et al. 2022). Therefore, these two species (C. paranaense and C. clidemiae) are not included in current list of strawberry pathogens.
In sum, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, namely, nine spe cies of the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeospori oides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species of the C. acutatum com plex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miao liense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii,), two of the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two of the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and 
C. dematium s.s.), and one of the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.) as well as two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct 
Colletotrichum species could be found in recent publica tions (Vieira et al. 2020; Bhunjun et al. 2021; Jayawardene 
Page 5 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42  et al. 2021). Undoubtedly, the archives of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry will expand in the future.
The diversity of Colletotrichum spp. virulent to strawberry: a geographic perspective
So far, anthracnose epidemic has affected strawberry nursery and production fields worldwide. Reports on 
Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberry from literature curation at PubMed and Clarivate combined with Fungal database search (Farr and Rossman 2022) were retrieved to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthrac nose. As far as we could reveal, since 1931 till July 9, 2022, there were over 220 citations and 310 records referring to the identification of causal agents of straw berry anthracnose at Colletotrichum genus level in 36 countries on six continents, of which 282 records provided pathogen identification at a species or spe cies complex level. Moreover, following the timeline of identification history, 189 records (Fig. 1) were sup posed to delimit strawberry pathogens at a species level and included in the statistics (Table  1). It should be noted that, early reports largely provided pathogen information at a species complex level. Although only relevant reports on C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides after the year of Weir et al. (2012) and Han et al. (2016), respectively were accepted in Table 1, the frequent use of species complex name or outdated, misleading name for Colletotrichum pathogen cannot be completely excluded. For example, C. theobromicola (syn. to C. fra gariae) of the C. gloeosporioides complex has been clar ified many years ago (Rojas et al. 2010), but the name C. fragariae was still used in some publications later (Fang et al. 2012; Rojas-Flores et al. 2019). A similar situation occurs with the use of C. acutatum and C. gloeospori oides associated with strawberry in literatures. There fore, how many of these records are really attributable to C. acutatum s.s., C. gloeosporioides s.s., or C. theo bromicola still remains unknown.

The global diversity of Colletotrichum spp. virulent to strawberry was illustrated with the identification records supposed at a species level (Fig. 2a, b). Those reports on the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose doubtfully at a species level were excluded. Africa produces very small amount of strawberry. In Egypt, both the C. gloeospori oides and C. acutatum complexes were reported to infect strawberry although they were not identified at a species level (Embaby et al. 2010). C. nymphaeae was identified as the unique Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose in Kenya (Martínez-Culebras et  al. 2003; 
Baroncelli et  al. 2015) and South Africa (Jayawardena et al. 2016b).
Strawberry is widely cultivated in America, where the diversity of strawberry pathogens is fostered. In Canada, three species including C. fructicola (Weir et  al. 2012), 
C. nymphaeae, and C. lineola (Jayawardena et al. 2016b) were reported to be infectious to strawberry. At least six 
Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry were revealed in USA, namely, C. simmondsii (Faedda et  al. 2011), the dominant C. nymphaeae (Wang et al. 2019) C. siamense (Adhikari et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021; Oliveira et  al. 2022), the less prevailing C. fioriniae (Wang et  al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021), C. fructicola, and C. theobromi cola (Weir et  al. 2012; Oliveira et  al. 2022). In Mexico, only Colletotrichum spp. (genus level) from strawberry was reported (Alvarez 1976; Rojas-Flores et  al. 2019). 
C. nymphaeae infectious to strawberry was recorded in 
Colombia and Costa Rica (Baroncelli et al. 2015). C. sia mense (Capobiango et  al. 2016) C. karstii (Soares et  al. 2021) were identified to infect strawberry in Brazil. In 
Argentina, only the Colletotrichum species complexes (C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides) were reported to infect strawberry (Mónaco et al. 2000; Ramallo et al. 2000).
Strawberry anthracnose is widely prevailing in Asia. 
In Thailand, although both the C. acutatum and C. gloe osporioides complexes had been reported to be associated with strawberry (Photita et al. 2004; Than et al. 2008a, b; 
Hyde et al. 2018), the identification of Colletotrichum in strawberry at a species level was absent. In India, C. dem atium was isolated from diseased strawberry (Sharma et a. 2013). In Bangladesh, C. siamense was shown to cause strawberry crown rot (Gupta et  al. 2019). In Israel and 
Iran, C. nymphaeae was revealed to infect strawberry fruits (Jayawardena et  al. 2016b; Karimi et  al. 2017). In 
Japan, virulent C. fructicola (predominant) and C. sia mense, as well as less virulent C. aenigma and C. kaha wae were identified as strawberry pathogens (Gan et  al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018). In Korea, only C. fructicola was confirmed virulent to strawberry (Nam et al. 2013), although C. acutatum (specie complex) from diseased strawberry had ever been documented before (Nam et al.

Page 7 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42  2008). In China, a total of 11 Colletotrichum species have been reported as strawberry-infectious, which will be comprehensively introduced later.
In Europe, strawberry anthracnose was largely attrib utable to the C. acutatum complex. C. godetiae strains infectious to strawberry were present in Ireland and Nor way (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Chethana et al. 2016). C. nym phaeae was the only Colletotrichum species reported as strawberry pathogen in Denmark (Braganca et al. 2016), 
Bulgaria (Bobev et al. 2002; Jelev et al. 2008; Jayawardena et al. 2016b), Switzerland, and Portugal (Baroncelli et al. 2015). Both C. godetiae and C. nymphaeae were identi fied as strawberry pathogens in Netherlands (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Jayawardena et al. 2016b) and Spain (Damm et  al. 2012; Baroncelli et  al. 2015). In United Kingdom, five species including C. nigrum (Liu et  al. 2013), more aggressive C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae as well as less aggressive C. godetiae and C. aenigma (Baroncelli et  al. 2015) had been reported as strawberry pathogens, of which C. nigrum and C. aenigma were beyond the C. acu tatum complex. In Belgium, four species of the C. acu tatum complex: C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, and C. salicis were identified as strawberry pathogens (Grammen et al. 2019). Both C. fioriniae (Baroncelli et al. 2015) C. nymphaeae (Jayawardena et  al. 2016b) were also isolated from diseased strawberry in France. In Italy, pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose were identi fied as C. simmondsii (Faedda et al. 2011), C. nymphaeae (Damm et  al. 2012), C. acutatum s.s. (Vitale and Infan tino 2014), and C. siamense (Jayawardena et  al. 2016b). 
Besides, there were reports of C. acutatum (complex) causing strawberry anthracnose rot, although not delim ited at a species level in four additional countries of 
Europe: Germany (Nirenberg et al. 2002), Czech Repub lic (Novotný et  al. 2007), Finland (Lilja et  al. 2011), and 
Montenegro (Latinovic et  al. 2012). Generally speaking, 
Colletotrichum spp. infectious to strawberry beyond the 
C. acutatum complex was only reported in United King dom and Italy of Europe. 
In Australia of Oceania, at least five Colletotrichum spe cies including C. simmondsii (Damm et al. 2012), C. acu tatumm s.s., C. nymphaeae, C. alienum, and C. coccodes (Shivas et  al. 2016) were reported to cause strawberry diseases. In New Zealand, distinct species including C. salicis (Jayawardena et al. 2016b) C. fioriniae (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Braganca et al. 2016) were recorded as straw berry pathogens.
An overview on the global distribution of strawberry pathogenic Colletotrichum spp. showed that the num ber of common species frequently found worldwide and those of potential endemism reported only in one region are roughly the same (Table  1). Generally, Colle totrichum spp. of the C. acutatum complex pathogenic to strawberry are epidemic in Europe, Africa, and Oce ania, whereas species of the C. gloeosporioides com plex are prevailing in strawberry fields in East Asia and 
North America. C. nymphaeae and C. acutatum s.s. of the C. acutatum complex are cosmopolitan pathogens of strawberry reported in six continents. C. fructicola, 
C. siamense, and C. theobromicola of the C. gloeospori oides complex are among the top five species threatening strawberry. In Africa, Europe and western Asia, C. nym phaeae is more prevailing in strawberry fields than other species. In northern China, Korea, and Japan of eastern 
Asia-Pacific region, C. fructicola is prevailing. Recently, 
C. siamense is increasingly prevailing in USA (Adhikari et  al. 2019; Oliveira et  al. 2022) and China (Wang et  al. 2022), which is in accordance with the tolerance of C. siamense to high temperature observed in several labs (Han et  al. 2016; Chung et  al. 2020; Zhang et  al. 2020). 
It is expected that the diversity and global distribution of Colletotrichum pathogens of strawberry are undergo ing plentiful changes with the gradual shift of agricultural system under a global warming context.
The prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberry in China
China has become the largest strawberry producer in the world since 2010 (annual statistic data of the Straw berry Division, Chinese Society for Horticultural Sci ence). Strawberry growers in Chinese mainland planted 173,333 hectares and produced fruits of five million tons in 2021 (Zhang 2021). Diversified cultivation and climate conditions in China favored a high biodiversity of vari ous pathogens for strawberry. The first formal report of strawberry anthracnose in China (Jiangsu Province) was by Hu (1990) on the fifth annual conference of Chinese 
Society of Plant Pathology. In Shanghai, C. fragariae and 
C. acutatum were identified as strawberry pathogens (Shao 1992; Ye et al. 1997). Later, fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was reported in Shanghai based on morphol ogy identification (Dai et  al. 2006). Molecular analysis with ITS sequences facilitated the identification of 16 C. gloeosporioides isolates and one C. acutatum isolate sam pled during 1996–2006 in Shanghai (Ren et  al. 2008). 
Based on ITS sequences and restriction enzyme diges tion, 31 Colletotrichum isolates isolated from diseased strawberry during 2006–2007 in Shanghai and Zhejiang were identified as C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and 
C. fragariae (Xie et al. 2010). Afterwards, C. gloeospori oides and C. fragariae were again reported as pathogens for strawberry in Zhejiang (Ren et al. 2011). There were 114 fungal isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex col lected from diseased strawberry during 2010–2013 in 
Zhejiang Province, although not distinguished at a spe cies level (Lin et al. 2016). 
Page 8 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42 
The first use of multi-locus phylogenetic analysis inte grated with morphological characterization by Han et  al. (2016) created a new situation for understanding strawberry anthracnose in China. Based on 11 published works (Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Bi et al. 2017a, b; He et  al. 2019; Chen et  al. 2020; Chung et  al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; 
Wang et  al. 2022) and current work distinguished at a species level, we provided a glimpse of the overall popu lation structure and relative prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. in strawberry fields in China (Fig. 3). Since 2016, a total of 492 isolates belonging to 11 Colletotrichum spe cies of four complexes C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, 
C. boninense, and C. truncatum have been identified as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in China. 
Analyzing the prevalence of Colletotrichum species revealed that the C. gloeosporioides complex was most widely reported. Currently, C. siamense (226 isolates, 45.9% of the total) is the most predominantly reported species in strawberry fields of China across a wide range of latitudes and is distributed in nearly all provinces except for Liaoning, followed by C. fructicola (189 iso lates, 38.4%) similarly distributed across whole China. 
We acknowledge limitations in above illustration (Fig. 3) due to the availability of data sources. But the broad prev alence of the C. gloeosporioides complex on strawberry is not limited in China. C. fructicola has been identified as the predominant fungus causing strawberry anthracnose in both South Korea (Nam et  al. 2013) and Japan (Gan et al. 2017).
Actually, the occurrence of C. acutatum s.l., C. bonin ense s.l., and C. truncatum s.l. species was essentially ran dom in China. Notably, C. nymphaeae and C. miaoliense were only identified in temperate zones including Hebei and Beijing or from subtropical regions with an elevation approximately 1000 m (1100 m in Enshi, Hubei; 1300 m in Renai or 960 m in Shitan Nantou, Taiwan) (Han et al. 2016; Chung et al. 2020).
Concerning the regional biodiversity in Colletotri chum spp. pathogenic to strawberry, a higher diver sity could be observed in Beijing (Jayawardena et  al. 2016a; Bi et  al. 2017a, b; Zhong et  al. 2021), Hubei (Han et al. 2016) and Taiwan (Chung et al. 2020) than other regions, which might be partially interpreted from the diversified geographic conditions and sub climates in these regions. Actually, C. fructicola was most prevalent in Sichuan Province (Jian et  al. 2021). 
In Shanghai, Shandong, and Anhui Provinces, C. fruc ticola and C. siamense exhibited a matched occurrence in strawberry fields (Jayawardena et al. 2016; He et al. 2019; Zhang et al. 2020; Zhong et al. 2021). However, 
C. siamense took the predominant position in straw berry fields of Hubei and Taiwan, where the climate is subtropical with higher annual average tempera ture. Latitude and elevation in relation to temperature variations might play some roles in affecting the geo graphic distribution of Colletotrichum pathogen (Han et al. 2016).
Host ranges of C. siamense and C. fructicola, the most prevailing causal agents of strawberry crown rot
The vast majority of Colletotrichum fungi are not host specific but adapt to a wide range of hosts. This is one of the main difficulties in managing Colletotrichum spp. and reducing their destructive effects in agricultural produc tion. Comparative analysis of host range might partially reflect the prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum spp. in strawberry fields. Of the five Colletotrichum complexes associated with strawberry, the number of Colletotri chum species–host species combinations by complex was 516, 295, 129, 58, and 37 for the C. gloeosporioides, 
C. acutatum, C. boninense, C. truncatium, and C. dem atium complex, respectively (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Obviously, the host range of Colletotrichum specie complex is positively correlated with their prevalence in strawberry fields (Fig. 2).
As the most prevailing pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose crown rot in Asia-Pacific region (Nam et al. 2013; Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Gan et al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; 
Zhong et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022), 
C. siamense and C. fructicola are actually the top two 
Colletotrichum species most frequently occurred world wide (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Both two species are cosmopolitan fungi adapting to a wide range of host plants, most reported in tropical and sub-tropical regions but with significantly higher occurrences in Asia than in other continents. In vitro mating of fungal isolates dem onstrated that C. fructicola is homothallic whereas C. siamense is heterothallic (Oliveira et al. 2022), hinting the latter with a relatively higher capability of genetic muta tions and flexibility, partially congruent with a wider host spectrum than C. fructicola.
To provide practical information for strawberry anthracnose management, we updated the host ranges of C. fructicola and C. siamense through website search at Fungal database (on July 8, 2022 at https:// nt. ars- grin. gov/ funga ldata bases/) and determined the taxonomy of these hosts (on July 15–16, 2022 at https:// www. iplant. cn/). This analysis resulted in a significantly wider range of hosts for C. siamense and C. fructicola. than ever sug gested in previous publications (da Silva et  al. 2020; 
Bhunjun et  al. 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/ https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/ https://www.iplant.cn/ https://www.iplant.cn/ 
Page 9 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42  
Accordingly, the host ranges of these two predominant pathogens were sorted based on their taxonomy (Table 2 and Additional file 1: Table S1). 
A total of 314 and 358 plant host records were obtained for C. fructicola and C. siamense at Fungal Database (July 8, 2022), respectively. Four additional host records of C.

Pie charts were generated with log‑10 transformed numbers of fungal isolates in certain region obtained from 11 publications since 2016 (Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Bi et al. 2017a, b; He et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022). A strain of C. siamense from Yunnan Province was isolated in current work, with its ITS, Actin, and ApMAT barcodes deposited in GenBank under the accession numbers OM362512, OM362513, and 
OM362514, respectively.

Since some host records were not deter mined at a species level, we sorted these hosts at a genus level based on taxonomic analysis at https:// www. iplant. cn/. C. siamense is associated with hosts of 111 genera including one genus of gymnosperm (Cycas), 10 genera of basal angiosperms, 26 genera of monocots, and 74 genera of dicots. Rosales and Malpighiales are the top two orders of plants containing nine genera, followed by Fabales (8), 
Sapindales (8), Lamiales (6), Malvales (6), Asparagales (6), and Alismatales (6) hosting C. siamense. By con trast, C. fructicola is associated with hosts of 75 genera, a relatively smaller spectrum than that of C. siamense. No gymnosperm was recorded as C. fructicola host, and the top three plant orders hosting this species are Rosales (9 genera), Sapindales (7), and Caryophyllales (6).
Records of plant hosts cross-infected or co-infected by multiple Colletotrichum species were not scarcely (Dean et  al. 2012; Hirayama et  al. 2018; da Silva et  al. 2020). Indeed, the co-occurrence of C. fructicola and 
C. siamense has been simultaneously identified in a same strawberry production field in Shanghai (Liu et al. 2021). The combined host range of the top two Colle totrichum species was expanded to 152 genera, including one of gymnosperm, 12 of angiosperms (six orders), 38 of monocots (10 orders), and 101 of dicots (22 orders). 
Among the combined hosts of C. fructicola and C. sia mense, Fabales, Sapindales, Rosales, and Asparagales are the top four orders each consisting of 12, 12, 11, and 11 genera, respectively. Furthermore, there were plants of 34 genera in 19 orders recorded as shared hosts of 
C. fructicola and C. siamense, including two genera of basal angiosperms (Annona and Persea), six of mono cots (Anthurium, Areca, Cymbopogon, Dioscorea, Musa, and Pennisetum) and 26 of dicots. Notably, the common hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense are composed of seven genera of Rosales order, namely, Fragaria, Malus, 
Pyrus, Prunus of Rosaceae, as well as Artocarpus, Ficus, and Ziziphus. 
The taxonomic positions of all hosts of C. siamense and 
C. fructicola were illustrated in Fig. 4, which provides a global evolutionary picture of all the plants (by genus) hosting the top two Colletotrichum species on the earth. 
The wide diffusion of C. siamense/ C. fructicola hosts in whole phylogenetic tree of angiosperms reinforced that they diverged very early, reasonably maintaining patho genic strategies well established during coevolution with flowering plants (Kar et al. 2004; Bhunjun et al. 2021).
Conclusions, implications, and perspectives
In this work we revisited the discovery history of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose and provided a global glimpse of the genetic diversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry. Under the current knowledge, 23 species of Colletotrichum, clustering in five species complexes as well as two singleton taxa have been listed as the causal agents of strawberry anthrac nose. Two species have been rejected as they turned out to be a confused citation (C. paranaense) or not patho genic to strawberry (C. clidemiae). Notably, it has been suggested that about 30% ITS sequences in open data bases including GenBank are relevant to wrong taxon of fungi such as Colletotrichum genus (Hofstetter et  al. 2019; Boufleur et  al. 2021). Thus, future identification and acceptance of novel species as causal agents of crop anthracnose should be performed rigorously following the rules of both taxonomy and plant pathology, relying on not only multiple barcode genes but whole genome sequencing suggested.
Based on published data available we discussed the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in China. C. siamense and C. fructicola of C. gloeospori oides s.l. are currently most prevailing. The prevalence of

Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42  certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in one region is influenced by the whole agricultural ecosystem and especially interconnected with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of differ ent Colletotrichum species varied with geographic region and dynamically changed in certain region. In Shang hai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et  al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report showed that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et  al. 2010), but a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberry in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shift also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift of prevailing Colletotrichum species related to strawberry in several regions might be associated with global warming, changes in cultivation pattern from open field to protected cultivation or soil less elevated cultivation, and substitution of strawberry varieties. The wide application of raised plastic-mulched

Page 12 of 16Ji et al. Phytopathology Research            (2022) 4:42 beds in a protected cultivation significantly increased the temperature for strawberry production. It has been revealed that Colletotrichum species of C. gloeospori oides s.l. displayed an advantageous tolerance to high temperature than those of C. acutatum s.l. (Han et  al. 2016; Chung et  al. 2020). Besides, the prevalence of C. siamense and C. fructicola in China might be closely cor related with the wide cultivation of a highly susceptible cv. Benihoppe, since a susceptible host imposes a strong and direct selection on pathogen populations (Chen et al. 2017). It is expected that the biodiversity of Colletotri chum associated with strawberry in China would change in the future following the gradually expanded cultivation of resistant or partially resistant cultivars such as ‘Kanto seika’, ‘HongYu’, ‘YueXin’, ‘Tongzhou Princess’, and ‘Shang hai Fragrance’ in several provinces and regions.
There exists a high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species enabling them a powerful adaptation capability (Gan et  al. 2021). In the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloe osporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex composed of as many as 57 species, which has been considered as a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting more than 700 plant species (O’Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Bar oncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevail ing C. siamense and C. fructicola in Chinese strawberry fields belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l., actually the top two Colletotrichum species most frequently occurred on the earth, although with remarkably more records in Asia than in other continents. Both C. siamense and C. fruc ticola could affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed in the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. As compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects signifi cantly more plants including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry even infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For example, the prevalent C. siamense in straw berry fields had been reported as a human pathogen resulting in skin lesions in the immune compromised host (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum was reported as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et  al. 2018). C. dematium has also been reported to be capable of infecting human tissues such as cornea (Tal hinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations of straw berry pathogens with human invite our special attention to biosecurity during scientific research and agricultural practices.
The longest summer ever in Shanghai lasted 162 days in 2021 till middle Oct., with 52 days more than the summer 60 years ago, which evidenced the broad out burst of several diseases including anthracnose crown rot-caused mortality after transplanting in strawberry production fields. It is tempting to speculate that global warming will exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, the change in tem perature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the response of the specific “disease tri angle” to these variations (Velásquez et al. 2018). In an era of anthropogenic habitat modification and climate change, how can we mitigate the impacts of global warming on strawberry sustainable development? 
To meet with this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry, especially those prevailing ones such as C. siamense and C. fructicola in life cycle and pathogenesis. For a better control of anthracnose crown rot, it is essential to produce disease-resistant strawberry varieties. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot integrated with enhanced tolerance to high tem perature would be one of the most important aims for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, apparent latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration rather than adap tation to new climates in situ is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates, and host jumps and transitions occur frequently (Bebber et  al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). In turn, shifts in host range also facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Corredor-Moreno and Saunders 2020). The evolution and hence flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges of the destructive Colletotrichum spp. would simultaneously contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, much atten tions should be ongoingly paid to changes in the biodi versity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.
The present study provided a comprehensive list of 
Colletotrichum species virulent to strawberry and the global diversity of these fungi with their occurrence data, which will help to establish an improved disease management and to design appropriate quarantine monitoring in trade for strawberry. The relative preva lence of distinct Colletotrichum species will guide the studies on fungicide sensitivity of pathogens and strain- or species-specific susceptibility of strawberry varie ties. Knowledge of pathogen host range can further help to manage plant disease in choice of crop rotation, intercropping, elimination of reservoirs such as weeds, quarantine, forecasting disease emergence, and risk assessment (Morris and Moury 2019). Since the most prevailing C. siamense and C. fructicola causing straw berry crown rot infect many economically important crops, such knowledge will hold implications in agri cultural practices not confined to strawberry.
