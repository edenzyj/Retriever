Abstract Colletotrichum fungi belonging to the Col letotrichum gloeosporioides species complex include a number of economically important postharvest pathogens that often cause anthracnose. Until now, different species within this group could only be distinguished from one another reliably using multigenic phylogenetic analyses.
Using a comparative genomics approach, we developed a marker that can differentiate Colletotrichum fructicola, 
Colletotrichum aenigma and Colletotrichum siamense within the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on 
PCR amplicon size differences. When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing different species of Col letotrichum infecting strawberries in Japan and contributes to our understanding on the diversity of anthracnose pathogens in Japan.

Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often cause anthrac nose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthrac nose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, causing at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.
Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum may be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories (Cai et al. 2011). Several of these lineages have now been systematically classified as species complexes comprising closely related sibling species (Weir et al. 2012). Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). In addition, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences alone, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing dif ferent species within this species complex. However, it is important to distinguish between species within the same species complex since different species may warrant dif ferent infection management strategies (Cai et al. 2011).
For example, it is known that, while Colletotrichum kahawae is an aggressive pathogen of coffee, Col letotrichum asianum, Colletotrichum fructicola and Col letotrichum siamense are opportunistic pathogens and thus

In Japan, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed toC. gloeosporioides and, at least to our knowledge, there have not been studies to determine whether different members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex are associated with strawberry infections. In previous studies, however, rep 
PCR analysis indicated that even within Japan alone, infec tions are caused by strains that can be subdivided into groups that can be distinguished genetically (Suzuki et al. 2010, 2012). In this study,we found that at least three distinct species, C. fructicola, C. siamense and Colletotrichum aenigma, were responsible for strawberry anthracnose dis ease in the Chiba Prefecture in Japan. Using genomic anal yses, we designed a set of PCR markers that can distinguish these species within theC. gloeosporioides species complex.
Using these markers, we identified isolates that were col lected in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, between 1994 and 2014.
Our data suggest thatC. fructicola has been the predominant species in this region during the last two decades.Materials and methods 
Isolation of anthracnose pathogens from infected strawberry 
Here we use ‘‘isolate’’ to refer to a pure culture of a single sample from an infected plant; the term ‘‘strain’’ refers to a defined isolate that can be distinguished from other isolates using phylogenetic methods, in this case, based on six combined loci (ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, TUB and GAPDH). 
Isolates from the C. gloeosporioides species complex were collected from anthracnose lesions on strawberry (Fra garia 9 ananassa) or randomly sampled, latently infected strawberry plants from the Inba, Chiba, Kimitsu, Awa, 
Chosei, Sanbu and Kaiso regions in Chiba Prefecture between 1994 and 2014. From latently infected plants, conidia were isolated using the ethanol immersion technique (Ishikawa 2003). These isolates were identified as members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex using the primer 
CgInt and the universal primer ITS4 (Mills et al. 1992).Comparative genomic analysis 
Pairwise alignments of genome assemblies were carried out using the nucmer program with default settings (Kurtz et al. 2004). Conserved regions present in the genomes of 
C. fructicola (Cg38), C. aenigma (Cg56; MAFF 305913) and C. siamense (Cg363; P. Gan et al. unpublished data) were identified using the bedtools suite of programs (Quinlan and Hall 2010). The sequences encompassing the marker regions have been deposited in GenBank (accessions KX247845–KX247850). Nucleotide BLAST searches were carried out using the nucleotide sequences between the predicted primer binding sites as queries against specific individual genome assemblies in CLCGe nomicsWorkbench8 (QIAgen) (E-value cutoff = 1E-5).Phylogenetic analysis 
Sequences from actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH), b-tubulin 2 (TUB) and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) were amplified from isolates using primers in Table 1 from fungal DNA extracted using the DNeasy kit (QIAgen).
PCR reactions were set up with 29 PCR mix (Promega), 0.5 lM each of forward and reverse primers (Table 1) and 25–75 ng of purified fungal DNA per tube. DNA sequences from these isolates have been deposited in GenBank (ac cessions KU642469–KU642552 and KX513878– 
KX513929). PCR was carried out at 95 �C for 3 min; followed by 35 cycles of 95 �C for 30 s, 55 �C for 30 s and 72 �C for 1 min; and a final extension step at 72 �C for 5 min. The DNA sequences obtained were aligned with sequences of previously classified isolates (Weir et al. 2012) using the program MAFFT version 7.215 (Katoh et al. 2002) and trimmed using the trimAl program version 1.2rev59 (Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009) with the auto mated1 settings. Concatenating the sequences resulted in an alignment consisting of 2854 positions, which were then partitioned according to genes and used for phylogenetic tree analysis using a maximum likelihood analysis in 
RAxML version 8.2.4 (Stamatakis 2014) and a Bayesian inference analysis using MrBayes version 3.2.6 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). The program Partitionfinder ver sion 1.1.1 (Lanfear et al. 2012) was used to identify the best nucleotide substitution models for the analysis of each partition using the BIC criteria (Lanfear et al. 2012). Both 
RAxML and MrBayes analyses were performed using the 
GTRGAMMA ? I model for each partition, allowing each partition to evolve under different rates. MrBayes was run twice for 20,000,000 generations with samples taken every 1000 generations with the first 25% of generations dis carded as burnin. Trees were visualized in FigTree version 1.4.2 (http://tree.bio.ed.ac.uk/software/figtree/). Sequences from Colletotrichum boninsense (Weir et al. 2012) were included as an outgroup.Genotyping of isolates 
PCR reactions were carried out using extracted fungal DNA and the Marker 1 and Marker 2 primer pairs (Table 1) for 30 cycles at 95 �C for 1 min, 55 �C for 30 s and 72 �C for 30 s; followed by a final extension step at 72 �C for 5 min before separation in a 1% agarose gel.

The genomes of three strains isolated from infected straw berry plants, Cg38 (isolated fromChiba), Cg56 (isolated from 
Tochigi) and Cg363 (isolated fromChiba), which belonged to different groups based on a previous rep-PCR analysis (Suzuki et al. 2012), were sequenced. These strains were then classified using the multigenic phylogenetic analysis of the 
ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, GAPDH and TUB sequences (Fig. 1). In the multigenic phylogenetic trees (Figs. 1, 2), the three strains were separated into three separate species within theC. gloeosporioides species complex:C. fructicola (Cg38), 
C. aenigma (Cg56) and C. siamense (Cg363).
The Cg38 strain was found to be closely related to the previously sequenced C. fructicola Nara gc5 (Gan et al. 2013) and was used as a reference strain in subsequent analyses. Pairwise alignments of the genome assemblies were carried out using theC. fructicola (Cg38) assembly as a reference strain. A total of 5987 genomic regions identified using the nucmer analysis (Fig. 3), comprising 6.35 Mb of sequence that were present in the reference strain, were not conserved in the C. siamense and C. aenigma assemblies.
Among the 5897 genomic regions, 2203 genomic regions were specific to the reference C. fructicola strain. Of the other 3784 regions, 3110 unconserved regions were flanked by at least 2 kb of sequence in the reference strain. Of these 3110 unconserved regions, 1025 target regionswere between 200 bp and 1 kb in size. As a condition for primer design, it was necessary to identify target regions flanked by highly conserved regions. Thus, sequences including these 1025 target regions were queried for overlap with 6153 genomic regions that were conserved among the three strains men tioned. A total of 1365 potential conserved regions were found to flank the target regions (Fig. 3).
Among these, two loci were manually selected for fur ther analysis. Approximately 1.5–4 kb of the selected loci from the reference strain were then used as queries for a 
BLAST search of the available genome assemblies. Pri mers were then designed based on sequences that were conserved in all isolates and present in single-copy regions.
Primers were tested on a number of isolates that were classified based on phylogenetic trees based on ACT, CAL, 
CHS-1, ITS, TUB and GADPH sequences including sequences from members of the previously classified C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012).Test of markers Marker 1 Test of markers 
In the C. fructicola genome, the region targeted by Marker 1 was found to overlap with the CGGC5_05943 gene,

C. fructicola Nara gc5 (Gan et al. 2013), C. sublineola (Baroncelli et al. 2014a), C. fioriniae (Baroncelli et al. 2014b), and C. gloeosporioides (Alkan et al. 2013) showed that the amplified region was specific to C. fructicola, C. aenigma and C. siamense. Indeed, according to BLAST analysis (cutoff E-value = 1E-5), the sequence was also absent in the genome assembly of the closely related C. gloeosporioides strain sequenced by Alkan et al. (2013). In 
PCR reactions, Marker 1 amplified a single band from various C. gloeosporioides species complex members including C. kahawae strains (Fig. 4a).Marker 2 
PCR with Marker 2 showed amplification of bands of *1 kb from Cg38 (C. fructicola), *550 bp in Cg363 (C. siamense) and *300 bp from Cg56 (C. aenigma; Fig. 3) strains. The locus containing Marker 2 is located in an intergenic region and includes a region with multiple related sequences in other parts of the genome assemblies according to the BLAST search, indicating that while the primer binding regions are specific, they flank a potential repeat region. To confirm that the different PCR amplicon sizes are correlated with different species, at least five isolates from each pattern (Table 2) were classified using multilocus phylogenetic trees that were drawn using 
Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods (Figs. 1, 2).
Both methods were found to result in trees that were consistent in terms of their topologies (Figs. 1, 2). Cg192, 
Cg231, Cg255, Cg131 and NK24, which all showed the same sized amplicon of *550 bp (Fig. 4b), were all classified as C. siamense according to the multilocus phy logenetic trees (Figs. 1, 2). In addition, amplicons of *300 bp were amplified from the DNA of Cg111, Cg112, 
Cg132, Cg191 and NK18, which all clustered together with known strains that have previously been identified as C. aenigma. All four of the isolates that did not show ampli fication with Marker 2 but that could be amplified by 
Marker 1 were classified as C. kahawae (Fig. 4a, b). The lack of PCR products indicate that the region amplified by 
Marker 2 may be specific to members within the Musae subclade in the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Figs. 1, 2).
Genotyping of isolates from the Chiba Prefecture between 1994 and 2014 
A total of 115 Colletotrichum isolates from strawberry plants in Chiba Prefecture were identified as belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex using the CgInt and ITS4 marker sequences (Mills et al. 1992). These were then classified as virulent or less virulent using a previously designed primer pair (Suzuki et al. 2008). According to these results (Fig. 5), 88 isolates were identified as virulent and 27 as less virulent isolates. When the isolates were then tested using Marker 2, 81 of the 88 virulent isolates tested (92%) were classified as C. fructicola, while the remaining seven were classified as C. siamense based on the amplified 
PCR band sizes (Fig. 5a). On the other hand, 14 of the 27 less virulent isolates were identified as C. aenigma, while eight were identified as C. siamense and one as C. fructi cola (Fig. 5b). The identification of C. fructicola as the predominant virulent species of anthracnose growing on strawberry in the Chiba Prefecture was consistent from 1994 to 2014.Discussion 
In recent years, the need to reclassify plant pathogens such as Colletotrichum using molecular-based techniques has been recognized because previous classifications based on morphology and host range have been found to be likely incorrect or less definitive (Ko Ko et al. 2011). Studies to characterize which specific species are associated with infections are important since different species may be associated with different infection outcomes in the field as mentioned for coffee anthracnose (Prihastuti et al. 2009).

To divide strains into different groups, other studies have made use of random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphisms, internal transcribed spacer-re striction fragment length (ITS-RFLP) polymorphisms or classification by ITS sequences (Gautam 2014; Smith 2008). While RAPD and ITS-RFLP polymorphisms give an indication of genetic variability among isolates, specific polymorphisms have not yet been associated with specific species. Further, the classification of strains using a single marker sequence has been found to be insufficient to dis tinguish strains belonging to different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012).
Using a comparative genomics strategy, we successfully developed a single marker to distinguish among three 38 54 232 39 78 363 131 192 255 NK 24 231 130 56 111 112 132 191 NK 18 129 128 303 190

Fig. 5 Numbers and types of virulent (a) and less virulent (b) isolates of Colletotrichum from the field by year 20 J Gen Plant Pathol (2017) 83:14–22 123 common pathogens of strawberry, C. fructicola, C. sia mense and C. aenigma. The described marker flanks a short repeat that is expanded in C. fructicola relative to C. sia mense and C. aenigma. It is likely that this sequence was gained/expanded in this group because it was absent in closely related C. kahawae strains. It is believed that the comparative genomics method utilized in this study is a practical strategy that can be further utilized to develop markers for other distinguishing traits or species differences.
The multilocus phylogenetic analysis of 20 isolates isolated from Japan indicated that these isolates tended to group with one another within each species, hinting at single, rather than multiple introductions of the different species into the field. This result is perhaps unsurprising given that the isolates were from a restricted geographical region, but remains to be confirmed with further phyloge netic analyses since this analysis was restricted to only 20 isolates.
From the analysis of isolates collected within Chiba 
Prefecture over 20 years, we showed that at least four species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex can infect strawberry plants in the field. This mirrors findings on mango anthracnose, which had previously been attrib uted to C. gloeosporioides infections (Lima et al. 2013). In more recent years, mango anthracnose has been revealed to be caused by different species which also belong to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, namely C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. tropicale, C. karstii and C. dianesei (Lima et al. 2013). Different species also seem to contribute to strawberry anthracnose infections. Recent studies have found that different species of the C. gloeosporioides species complex are associated with strawberry plants including C. fructicola, C. siamense and C. theobromicola in the United States (Weir et al. 2012), C. fructicola in 
Korea (Nam et al. 2013) and C. murrayae, C. gloeospori oides, C. fructicola and C. aenigma in China (Han et al. 2016). In our study, we found that species from both the 
Musae and to a lesser extent, the Kahawae clades can infect strawberries in Japan. In addition, although C. fructicola was identified as the predominant virulent species in the field, both virulent and less virulent isolates of C. fructicola and C. siamense were identified in the present study, indicating that specific species are not strictly correlated with virulence on strawberry plants, unlike what has been observed for coffee anthracnose (Prihastuti et al. 2009).
The identification of multiple species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberry plants indicates the diversity of strawberry anthracnose pathogens, which in turn suggests that this population of pathogens can adapt to changing conditions (McDonald and Linde 2002), which may then inform disease management strategies.
