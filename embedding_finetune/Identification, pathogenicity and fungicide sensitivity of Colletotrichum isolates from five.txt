Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an economically important woody nut and edible oil tree all over the world. However, walnut production is limited by walnut anthracnose, which is a disastrous disease that causes signifi cant yield losses. Studying the etiology of anthracnose on walnut and the pathogens’ virulence and sensitivities to fungicides would be beneficial for effective control. This study was conducted to identify the pathogen of walnut anthracnose and reveal the population diversity of pathogens through virulence, sensitivities to fungicides, and genetic variation. A to tal of 13 single-spore Colletotrichum isolates were collected from walnut anthracnose-diseased fruits and leaves from 13 walnut commercial or chards in Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces in China. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) according to multilocus phylogenetic analyses (internal tran scribed spacer, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase), morphological as well as cultural characters, and path ogenicity. When the same walnut tissue was inoculated with different isolates, the disease lesion size was different. The results showed that the virulence of all isolates was considerably different, and the differ ences were not correlated with geographic origins. The virulence to wal nut leaves and fruits inoculated with the same isolate was significantly different. Based on the virulence to walnut leaves and fruits, the 13 iso lates were divided into three groups. Virulence of 69.2% of the isolates to walnut fruits was higher than that to leaves; 15.4% of isolates had no difference in pathogenicity, and the virulence to walnut leaves was higher for 15.4% of isolates. Tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim inhibited the growth of fungal mycelia, and the concentra tion for 50% of maximal effect (EC50) values were 0.4 to 20.5, 0.6 to 2.6, 0.2 to 1.6, and 0.002 to 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, with average values of 6.5 ± 6.9, 1.5 ± 0.6, 0.9 ± 0.4, and 0.1 ± 0.05 mg/ml, respectively. All isolates were more sensitive to difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbenda zim than tebuconazole (P < 0.01). Isolate sensitivities to the same fungi cide were different. Isolates SL-31 and TS-09 were the least sensitive to carbendazim and tebuconazole, respectively, and the resistance ratios were 87.3 and 51.6, respectively. Sensitivities to difenoconazole and flu silazole were largely consistent among all isolates, and the resistance ra tios were from 1 to 4.6 and from 1 to 7, respectively. Therefore, difenoconazole and flusilazole could be chosen for disease control.
The differences of pathogenicity and fungicide sensitivity were not cor related with geographic regions. These results indicated that there was high intraspecific diversity of populations in C. gloeosporioides s.s. that caused walnut anthracnose. For effective management, the targeted con trol strategy should be implemented based on the different geographic regions.

Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an important woody nut and edible oil tree throughout the world. Walnut trees are planted largely for their nuts, which are mainly used for food and oil expression (Blomhoff et al. 2006; Cortés et al. 2006). Walnut production is threatened by several insects and diseases (Khan and Kundoo 2018; Tian et al.
1991; Wang and Tang 2018). Among these diseases, anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a crucial constraint to wal nut production in many walnut-planting areas in the world, and it of ten results in huge yield losses and even total losses in some walnut orchards (Da Lio et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2016). In Shandong prov ince, China, walnut anthracnose occurred from late June to harvest.
The spots were about 5 to 10 mm in diameter in mid- to late July. Some spots were merged into large necrotic areas in the middle of
August, and the fruits and leaves failed to develop normally or drop ped prematurely. The fruits and leaves infected in August would shed in a large area before harvest (late August to early September) (Zhu et al. 2014).
The genus Colletotrichum Corda is one of the most important and destructive plant pathogens worldwide. From the perspective of sci entific and economic significance, the genus Colletotrichum was considered as the eighth most important group of phytopathogenic fungi worldwide (Dean et al. 2012) and could attack >3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants (Manire et al. 2002; O’Connell et al.
2012), including many crops of cereals, fruits, vegetables, and orna mentals (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2010; Honger et al. 2016;
Huang et al. 2016). Several species of the genus Colletotrichum have been isolated from J. regia, such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato in Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa (Chen 2003; Cho and Shin 2004; Crous et al. 2000; Gadgil et al. 2005;
Gorter 1977; Kobayashi 2007; Pennycook 1989); Colletotrichum sp. in Mexico (Alvarez 1976); C. gloeosporioides from walnut fruits in Slovenia, which caused spots on green walnut fruits (Juhásová et al. 2005); Colletotrichum godetiae in Australia (Damm et al.
2012); Colletotrichum acutatum in Australia (Simmonds 1966); and C. acutatum sensu lato (s.l.; geographic origin and pathogenicity were unknown) (Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas 2005). In France,
Colletotrichum fioriniae, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides s.l. were isolated from walnut leaves, nuts, and buds, and they were confirmed to be the pathogens of walnut †Corresponding author: X.-Q. Wu; xqwu@njfu.edu.cn

In Brazil, C. nymphaeae caused wal nut anthracnose (Savian et al. 2019). In China, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (Chen 2003; Qu et al. 2011), C. acutatum (Liu et al.
1995), C. fioriniae (Zhu et al. 2015), Colletotrichum siamense (Wang et al. 2017), Colletotrichum fructicola (Wang et al. 2018), and Colletotrichum viniferum (He et al. 2019) were isolated from walnut. The pathogen of walnut anthracnose was not only C. gloeo sporioides but also, C. fructicola and C. siamense (Wang et al.
2017, 2018) in China. C. fioriniae could infect walnut leaves, and the symptoms were similar to anthracnose (Zhu et al. 2015).
C. viniferum only infected walnut leaves, and the symptoms were not typical (He et al. 2019).
There was a difference in pathogenicity of Colletotrichum iso lates. Zhang et al. (2014a) considered that the pathogenicity of the genus Colletotrichum from different sources to the same litchi cultivar was different. The virulence of C. siamense to walnut fruits was not consistent with that to leaves (Wang et al. 2017). Chemical control methods are the most commonly used strategies against anthracnose. These reports showed that the C. gloeosporioides causing grape ripe rot was resistant to thiophanate-methyl and diethofencarb (Chen et al. 2013). C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango, litchi, longan, etc. in Hainan province showed high resis tance to carbendazim (Zhang et al. 2014b). However, any differ ences in fungicide sensitivities of isolates causing walnut anthracnose remain unknown. There were abundant interspecies and intraspecific diversities of populations. The genetic diversity of grape anthracnose pathogens in Yunnan province was complex and inconsistent with geographic origins, host specificities, colony or spore morphologies, and pathogenicity to red globe grape (Deng et al. 2015). The diversity of populations of the isolates, which caused anthracnose in tea and other woody plants in Fujian prov ince, was consistent with host specificities, not with geographic origins (Liu et al. 2017). The genetic differences of walnut anthrac nose pathogens are largely unknown.
The objectives of this study were (i) to identify the species of the genus Colletotrichum causing walnut anthracnose using multilocus phylogenetic analyses and morphological characteristics, (ii) to de termine the pathogenicity of the isolates obtained from walnut fruits and leaves in China, and (iii) to examine the sensitivity of isolates to four fungicides (tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and car bendazim) using in vitro methods.Materials and Methods
Plant materials, pathogen isolation, and purification. From 2013 to 2014, walnut fruits and leaves with anthracnose symptoms were collected from 13 walnut orchards in Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Shandong provinces in China (Table 1).
Pure cultures were obtained from diseased walnut fruits and leaves as well as from single-spore isolation. The walnut fruits and leaves were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, and margins of the healthy and diseased tissues were cut into 3- to 4-mm2 segments. The seg ments were sterilized with 1% NaOCl for 60 s and 70% ethanol for 60 s, and they were washed in sterile distilled water three times. Five segments were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA; 1.5%, Difco
BD Diagnostics) and incubated at 28°C. Seven days later, hyphae were transplanted to PDA plates for sporulation. Using serial dilu tion, monosporic isolates were obtained (Choi et al. 1999; Than et al. 2008) and stored at 4°C on PDA slants. Most of the isolates were stored and preserved in the China Forestry Culture CollectionCenter (Table 2).
Morphological analysis. The isolates were cultured on PDA at 28°C for 5 days. The colony color, conidial masses, and zonation were observed and documented. A drop of sterile water was placed on a glass slide, and then, three acervuli were placed on the slide and gently crushed under a cover glass; a few drops of cedar oil were added under the cover glass to decrease water evap oration. Appressoria developed on the surface of the glass slide.
Acervuli, conidia, appressoria, conidiophores, and conidiogenous cells were observed under a compound microscope (Nikon
Eclipse 50i), and photomicrographs were taken with a high resolution QImaging camera system (QImaging); the sizes of con idia and appressoria were measured by cellSens standard software (Olympus).
DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses. Mycelia (growing for 5 days on PDA) were dried with sterile filter paper and collected in a sterile centrifuge tube. Mycelial powder was obtained by the trituration method in liquid nitrogen.

The mycelial powder was dissolved in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer (2% [wt/vol] CTAB, 1.42 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.0], and 0.2% [wt/vol] b-mercaptoethanol) and then, incubated at 65°C for 30 min. Geno mic DNAs of all isolates were extracted in conformity to the method described by Freeman et al. (1996). The PCR amplifications were conducted with the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and chitin synthase (CHS-1). Four loci were amplified: ribosomal DNA region using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 for ITS (Gardes and
Bruns 1993; White et al. 1990), GAPDH gene using primers
GDF-1 and GDR1 (Templeton et al. 1992), CHS-1 gene using pri mers CHS-79F and CHSI-354R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), and
ACT gene using primers ACT-512F and ACT-783R (Carbone and
Kohn 1999). Information about primer sequences, amplicon size, and PCR conditions is listed in Table 3.
The PCR reaction system was (with the total reaction volume of 25 ml) mixed with Taq DNA polymerase mix (12.5 ml), primer-F (1.0 ml), primer-R (1.0 ml), genomic DNA (2.0 ml), and ddH2O (8.5 ml). The PCR amplification procedure consisted of 36 cycles, and information about initial denaturation, denaturation, annealing, extension, and final extension are listed in Table 3. After PCR, all of the PCR amplification products were sequenced by Shanghai Per sonal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. All sequences have been deposited inGenBank (Table 2).
All ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences were com pared with the sequences of the already described species in the
Q-Bank (www.q-bank.eu) by blasting, and the sequences of 46Col letotrichum isolates were downloaded from GenBank (Table 2).
Colletotrichum boninenseMAFF 305972 was used as an outgroup, which was an ex-holotype culture that was isolated from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum. The sequences of each locus were aligned

Four genes per region were concat enated in an order of “ITS-GAPDH-ACT-CHS-1” using Fasta alignment joiner software (http://users-birc.au.dk/palle/php/fabox/ alignment_joiner.php). Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the concatenated sequence dataset using MEGA 7.0 software (Kumar et al. 2016), and two multilocus phylogenetic trees were generated with neighbor-joining method or maximum parsimony method.
The phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale, and the optimal tree with the sum of branch length was measured according to the num ber of substitutions per site to evaluate the relative stability of the branches.
Pathogenicity and virulence in leaves and fruits. Pathogenicity experiments were conducted at the experimental station of the Re search Center for the Prevention and Control of Invasive Forest Pests of Shandong Province. Healthy fruits (cultivar Xiangling, 1 month old) and leaves (fully expanded) were inoculated in vitro with plugs (⌀ = 5mm) of isolates cultured for 5 days. Thirteen isolates were used (Table 2). In total, 280 fruits and 168 leaves were rinsed with running tap water for 60 s, surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, and rinsed with sterile distilled water three times. All of the fruits and leaves were punctured with a red-hot needle (⌀ = 0.5 mm) on the surface.
The leaf was inoculated with two hyphal plugs, and the fruit was in oculated with one hyphal plug; the needle-wounded leaves and fruits were inoculated with blank agar plug as a control. Each isolate was inoculated to 20 fruits and 12 leaves; an additional 20 fruits and 12 leaves were treated with blank agar plugs as controls. All treatments and controls were placed into sterile tissue culture bottles (⌀ = 92 mm, h = 274 mm, v = 690 ml) containing two layers of wet paper towels to keep them moist at 28°C under a 12-h light/dark cycle. An thracnose symptoms were evaluated at the seventh day after in oculation. The fungus was reisolated from symptomatic lesions using the aforementioned method. The morphological characters

The lesion sizes and areas on fruits or leaves were measured at the 10th day after inoculation to evaluate virulence. The virulence of the isolates was compared using one-way analysis of variance, and means were compared by Tukey’s honestly significant difference (HSD) test at the 1% significance level using IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software.
In vitro sensitivity of isolates to four fungicides. The inhibitive activities of tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbenda zim to the isolates were estimated using a mycelium growth rate method in the laboratory.
Tebuconazole (97% a.i.; provided by Jiangsu Changlong Agro chemical Co., Ltd.) and difenoconazole (95.8% a.i.; provided by
Qingdao Hansen Biologic Science Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in ace tone; flusilazole (92% a.i.) and carbendazim (97.5% a.i.; provided by
Qingdao Hansen Biologic Science Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in cy clohexanone and 1% (wt/wt) hydrochloric acid, respectively. The concentration of all solutions was 10,000 mg/ml, and they were stored at 4°C.
Four fungicides were added to autoclaved PDA cooled to ca. 50°C.
PDA media were amended to result in 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/ml a.i. of tebuconazole, flusilazole, or difenoconazole and 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0mg/ml a.i. of carbendazim. PDAmedium without fungicide was used as control. Approximately 15 ml of PDA medium was decanted to each plate (⌀ = 90 mm). The isolates were cultured on PDAwithout fungicides at 28°C for 5 days, and the hyphae were cut into plugs (⌀ = 5 mm) with a cork borer. The plugs were placed at the center of PDA plates.
Additionally, one plug per plate was cultured at 28°C for 3 days.
Each treatment and control had four replicates, and the experiments were performed twice. The colony diameters were measured in a cross pattern. The original plug diameter was subtracted and mean of the colony diameters was calculated. All data were analyzed using
IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software, and concentration for 50% of max imal effect (EC50) values were estimated by the probit analysis. The frequency distribution of EC50 of the 13 isolates was plotted using
PROC FREQ and tested for normality (Fan et al. 2016).Results
Description of symptoms in the field. In major walnut production areas, walnut anthracnose disease mainly damaged leaves and fruits.
When the leaves were infected, the spots were nearly round or irreg ular, water soaked, and brown to dark brown. The spots expanded along the veins and formed long strip lesions. In a later stage, the older lesions became necrotic and perforated, and this resulted in early defoliation (Fig. 1A). When the fruits were infected, some sub circular or irregular spots appeared in the initial stage. The spots were water soaked, sunken, and brown to black (Fig. 1B). Some spots en larged and merged into large necrotic areas. In the necrotic areas, some acervuli were in concentric rings and oozed gelatinous pink co nidial masses (Fig. 1C). When the disease was serious, multiple spots merged and expanded to the whole fruit (Fig. 1D), and the pathogen reached the immature endocarp (nut shell). The fruits failed to

Disease symptoms on walnut kernels. 1362 Plant Disease /Vol. 104 No. 5 develop normally; most fruits dropped prematurely, and the kernels (nutmeat) were inedible (Fig. 1E). The degree of the severity of wal nut pericarp was in substantial agreement with walnut kernels. With the walnut pericarp spot expansion, the risk of damage to walnut ker nels increased. At the initial infection period, the spots were only in walnut pericarp, not in kernels, at this time, and the walnut kernels quality was not influenced by walnut anthracnose. When the walnut pericarp spot area was up to one-fourth of the whole fruit, the kernels were infected, and some spots were in kernels. At this point, the qual ity and quantity of the kernels were reduced (Fig. 2).
Isolate collection. The incidence was different in the 13 orchards, the highest incidence was in orchards 2 and 3, and the walnut variety was Xiangling (Table 1). A total of 59 isolates were obtained from diseased fruits and leaves. In orchard 7, the genera Colletotrichum and
Fusarium were isolated. The genera Colletotrichum and Alternaria were isolated in orchards 4, 6, and 8, and the genera Colletotrichum and Xanthomonas were in orchards 10 and 11. One Colletotrichum isolate was selected to represent an orchard (Table 1), and 13 isolates were preserved.
Morphological characteristics. On PDA, aerial mycelium was dense and cottony; the colonies were milky, pale gray to medium gray toward the center, in reverse, gray, and olivaceous gray to blue gray at the center, with sporadic dark gray flecks on the edge (Fig. 3A to C). Colonies were with the entire margin, and orange conidial masses were visible in acervuli. Sexual morph was absent. Asexual morph was present on PDA. Hypha was hyaline to medium brown, smooth, septate, and branched. Acervuli were observed (Fig. 3D).
Setae were not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline, smooth walled, and sometimes branched. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth, and cylindrical, often with a septum (Fig. 3G and H).

Conidia were straight and mostly cylindrical with broadly rounded ends that were sometimes slightly and gradually acute to the end (Fig.
3E). The size was (14.8 −) 16.7 − 17.3 (− 19.5) × (4.3 −) 5.0 − 5.3 (− 6.1) mm (�x = 16.9 ± 1.0 × 5.2 ± 0.4, n = 51), and L/W = 3.3. Ap pressoria were simple or in a small group, subglobose or ellipsoid, and rarely irregular (Fig. 3F). The size was (5.2 −) 6.7 − 7.6 (− 8.9) × (2.7 −) 5.0 − 5.9 (− 7.1) mm (�x = 7.2 ± 1.1 × 5.4 ± 1.0, n = 26), and 
L/W = 1.3. Consequently, the isolates were identified as C. gloeosporioides.
Phylogenetic analyses. Using the Blast option in the Q-Bank, all 
ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences were compared with the sequences of the known species.
Compared with the sequences of C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) isolates ICMP 17821 and ICMP 12939, the similarity of ITS

The isolates in bold are ex-types. 1364 Plant Disease /Vol. 104 No. 5 was from 99.3 to 100%; the CHS-1 sequences of all isolates showed 99.2 to 100% similarity. The similarity of GAPDH was from 89.9 to 98.6%, and the ACT sequences of isolates SL-30, LZ-02, SQ-141,
ZZ-27, YT-172, SL-31, HB-49, SL-37, SL-34, SMX-42H, and
ZQ-29 showed 100 and 99.6% similarity with C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates ICMP 17821 and ICMP 12939, respectively (Supple mentary Table S1). To compare with the sequences of 46 isolates downloaded from 
GenBank, ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 of all isolates were con catenated with the Fasta alignment joiner software. The aligned sequence was from 98.0 to 99.5% homologous to ex-type C. gloeo sporioides s.s. ICMP 17821. The multilocus phylogenetic trees were generated using neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony meth ods. There were a total of 1,061 sites in the final dataset, and con served sites, variable sites, parsimony informative sites, and singleton sites were 715, 312, 163, and 140, respectively. In the max imum parsimony phylogenetic tree, the tree length was 465, the con sistency index was 0.56, and the retention index was 0.84. The composite indices were 0.57 for all sites and 0.47 for parsimony informative sites. The isolates tested were in the same cluster with
C. gloeosporioides s.s. with 98% bootstrap support (Fig. 4). In the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, the sum of the branch length was 0.57. All 13 isolates studied were clustered with C. gloeospor ioides s.s., including its ex-type with 100% bootstrap support (Sup plementary Fig. S1). The multilocus phylogenetic analyses of four genes as well as mor phological characters, including colony, conidia, appressoria, coni diophores, and conidiogenous cells, demonstrated that all of the isolates were C. gloeosporioides s.s.
Pathogenicity and virulence to leaves and fruits. Walnut fruits and leaves were inoculated with 13 isolates. The infection occurred at the inoculation sites on leaves or fruits (Supplementary Fig. S2A to M), and symptoms resembled the anthracnose disease symptoms in the field (Fig. 1). The fruits and leaves in the controls had no symp toms 7 days after inoculation with blank agar plugs (Supplementary
Fig. S2N). The typical symptom appeared as a roughly circular or ir regular spot, and the infections were water soaked, sunken, and brown to black. The black lesions expanded and turned into necrotic areas. The fungus was reisolated from lesions using the aforemen tioned methods. Koch’s postulates were completed, and the results indicated that all 13 isolates obtained were the walnut anthracnose pathogen.
There were significant differences (P < 0.01) among the 13 isolates that caused anthracnose disease on walnut leaves or fruits. The lesion areas on leaves were from 0.44 ± 0.03 to 1.42 ± 0.21 cm2. Isolate ZQ 29 showed the highest virulence, whereas isolate YT-172 was the weakest in pathogenicity to walnut leaves. At the P < 0.01 level, all 13 isolates were divided into seven groups (Fig. 5). Based on the fruit lesion size, the isolate SQ-141 was the most virulent, and the lesion size was 2.53 ± 0.25 × 1.97 ± 0.25 cm. Isolates LZ-02,
SL-34, and HB-49 showed the weakest virulence, and the lesion sizes were 0.73 ± 0.05 × 0.63 ± 0.05, 0.77 ± 0.11 × 0.67 ± 0.05, and 0.77 ± 0.05 × 0.67 ± 0.05 cm, respectively. There were no significant differ ences (P < 0.01). The 13 isolates were distributed into five groups (Fig. 5).
The disease lesion on leaves and fruits inoculated with the same isolate showed considerable differences. The 13 isolates were di vided into three groups by comparing the virulence to walnut leaves and fruits. In group 1, the virulence to walnut fruits was higher than that to leaves, and nine isolates (69.2%) were in group 1. In group 2, there was no difference in pathogenicity, including isolates LZ-02 and ZQ-29. In group 3, the virulence of isolates to walnut leaves was higher, and isolates ZZ-01 and HB-49 were clus tered in group 3.

In vitro sensitivity of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to four fungicides. Four fungicides inhibited the growth of fungal myce lium. Tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbenda zim EC50 values were 6.5 ± 6.9, 1.5 ± 0.6, 0.9 ± 0.4, and 0.1 ± 0.05 mg/ml, respectively (Table 4). C. gloeosporioides s.s. was more sensitive to difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim than to tebuconazole (P < 0.01). The toxicities of carbendazim, flusilazole, and difenoconazole to C. gloeosporioides s.s. were not different (P < 0.01).
The result confirmed that the resistance ratios of all of the isolates to four fungicides were different (Fig. 6). The sensitivities to carben dazim and tebuconazole were significantly different among all iso lates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim were from 1 to 87.33; isolate HB-49 was the most sensitive one, whereas isolate SL-31 was the least sensitive to carbendazim. The resistance ratios to tebu conazole were from 1 to 51.59. Isolate SL-31 was the most sensitive one, and isolate TS-09 was the least sensitive one of all isolates. The sensitivities to difenoconazole and flusilazole were largely consistent among all isolates, and the resistance ratios were from 1 to 4.55 and 7, respectively.
There was a significant difference in resistance ratio of carbenda zim among the isolates. Therefore, difenoconazole and flusilazole could be used for disease control.Discussion
Tode was the first one to observe the genus Colletotrichum in 1790, and Corda (1831) legitimately described it in 1831. Since 2009, Cai et al. (2009) have proposed a Colletotrichum systematics approach based on a multigene phylogeny, comparing the isolates under study with type specimens. A clearly defined phylogenetic lineage should be combined with decipherable polyphasic characters, including morphology, physiology, pathogenicity, cultural charac teristics, and secondary metabolites. The taxonomy of the genus Col letotrichum has been significantly changed, and it has gone through numerous revisions, with the addition, typification, and synonymy of many species. Some new species were introduced; some species were segregated, and some species were abolished. As of 2019, there are 213 accepted species in the genus Colletotrichum (Dar et al. 2018; de Silva et al. 2019; Douanla-Meli and Unger 2017; Fu et al. 2019;
Gan et al. 2019; Jayawardena et al. 2016, 2017; Lee and Jung 2018; Marin-Felix et al. 2017; Sharma et al. 2017; Sun et al. 2019;
Xu et al. 2018). Most members of the genus Colletotrichum are im portant plant pathogens. Colletotrichum spp. may cause walnut anthracnose. Before 2015, the pathogen was identified as C. gloeosporioides based on morphologic characters or ITS data analy sis in China (Qu et al. 2011; Xiao et al. 2010; Zhu et al. 2014). C. gloeosporioides is a species complex and includes 38 closely related species (Jayawardena et al. 2016; Marin-Felix et al. 2017; Weir et al.
2012). These reports failed to determine the species to which the pathogens belonged in C. gloeosporioides s.l. Subtle differences in colony morphology exist among the sibling species, whereas the col onies of different isolates of the same species are morphologically different. Different Colletotrichum species could infect the same host, and the same species could infect different hosts. Several my cologists who worked on Colletotrichum taxonomy opined that the taxonomy system of the genus Colletotrichum based on morpholog ical characteristics, host range, and ITS data was confusing and that identification results were problematic (Than et al. 2008; Weir et al.
2012; Yang et al. 2009). Proper identification of the pathogen is the basis for developing effective management strategies. Therefore, it is very important to accurately distinguish the species from each other.
In this paper, by using multigene phylogeny, morphologic charac ters, and cultural properties, we confirmed that C. gloeosporioides s.s. was one of the species of the genus Colletotrichum responsible for walnut anthracnose in China. Several Colletotrichum species have been associated with walnut anthracnose, such as C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. fioriniae, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeospor ioides s.l. (Da Lio et al. 2018; Savian et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2017, 2018; Zhu et al. 2015). It is safe to state that walnut anthracnose is a complex disease. With more and more walnut anthracnose samples collected from more walnut orchards in wider geographic areas in
China, it is possible that moreColletotrichum species or new species responsible for walnut anthracnose will be determined or de scribed. Da Lio et al. (2018) obtained C. fioriniae and C. godetiae from nuts and buds in the same orchard, and they all caused wal nut anthracnose. Multiple Colletotrichum species can occur in the same orchard and from different walnut isolation sites. Whether multiple species may occur in the same walnut tissues remains

It is necessary to conduct further studies on infection time; infecting walnut independently or collaboratively; and disease occurrence patterns of C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. gloeosporioides s.s.
There was a high variability of virulence among the isolates of the same species (C. siamense, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae), which caused walnut anthracnose (Da Lio et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2017).
In this paper, virulence varied among isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. based on inoculation on walnut leaves or fruits. However, the vir ulence of the isolates to walnut fruits was different between C. gloeo sporioides s.s. andC. siamense. The virulence ofC. siamense isolates to walnut fruits was similar, whereas the virulence of C. gloeospor ioides s.s. isolates was significantly different. Even if the isolates were from the same geographic origin, the virulence of the isolates to walnut leaves or fruits showed a great discrepancy, and it appeared that the virulence differences were not correlated with geographic or igins. Compared with the virulence to walnut leaves and fruits, C. gloeosporioides s.s. and C. siamensewere more aggressive to walnut fruits than leaves. From the perspective of pathogen characters, the results probably explained why walnut anthracnose caused serious damage in some orchards, whereas much less damage occurred in other orchards. However, the results need be further confirmed by artificially inoculating living walnut trees in the fields. The virulence of isolates from different tissues in the same orchards remains un known and needs further study.
For controlling walnut anthracnose, the main management strat egy was to rely mainly on timely application of fungicides. We de termined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim, in this paper. Although the number of isolates was relatively restricted, the results still showed that there were dif ferences in resistance ratio to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole were from 1 to 87.3 and from 1 to 51.6, respectively. Isolates SL 31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37 were from Shangluo county, Shaanxi province, and the resistance ratios to tebuconazole were 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole were exten sively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the differences of sensitivities were perhaps consistent with frequency of the carben dazim or tebuconazole usage locally. The sensitivities of C. gloeo sporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim were different (Cao et al. 2017). Meanwhile, our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeo sporioides s.s. displayed differential sensitivities to carbendazim.
The results reflected the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. caus ing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To increase the control effect, it is important for practitioners to ascertain the isolate sensitivities to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratio, difenoconazole and flusilazole would be expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given planta tion. However, the efficacies need to be verified with more field trials in the future. For controlling walnut anthracnose effectively, it is im perative to identify the pathogen accurately. Meanwhile, it is also necessary to determine fungicide sensitivities of the different isolates of the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be cautiously chosen for the disease management, and fungicides with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.
In conclusion, the 13 isolates from the orchards were C. gloeo sporioides s.s. All of the isolates had been confirmed to be the path ogen of walnut anthracnose in China. The isolates from different geographic regions showed differences in virulence and fungicide sensitivities. The results preliminarily indicated that there was a high intraspecific diversity among the populations of C. gloeosporioides s.s. The study provided crucial information for managing this disease in China. For example, the targeted control strategy should be imple mented in accordance with the different geographic regions to reduce the losses caused by C. gloeosporioides s.s.Acknowledgments
