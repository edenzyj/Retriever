The small fruit crop, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and USA. It has gained remarkable acceptance from both growers and consumers. 
However, with the expansion of acreage, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) disease is posing a big challenge to the strawberry growers. In March 2016, typical ACR symptoms were observed on strawberry cultivar ’Strawberry Festival’ in a farmer’s field in Rajshahi district of 
Bangladesh.  Symptoms were evident on approximately 10% of the plants and included flagging of young leaves, mimicking lack of water, and wilting of entire plant in the heat of the day. A lengthwise cut through the crown of diseased plants showed characteristic shades of red and white marbling similar to that described by Weir et al. (2012) (Appendix 1a). 
Crowns of seven symptomatic strawberry plants were obtained after excising foliage and roots, and washed under running water for one hour. Crowns were then surface disinfested with 70% ethanol followed by 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 and 3 minutes, respectively. 
Small pieces (2 mm × 2 mm) of the internal infected marbled red-coloured tissues were cut with a sterile scalpel and placed on Corn Meal Agar medium, and incubated for 7 days at 25°C. Conidia grown on tissue pieces and hyphal mats came out from the tissues were streaked on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates to obtain single conidial colonies. Two of the single-conidial isolates (BRSP08 and BRSP09) that had white margins with circular, dull orange centres were selected to prove Koch’s postulates (Appendix 1b). The average mycelial growth rate was 9.8 mm per day at 25°C on PDA with cottony aerial growth and pale yellowish to pinkish in color. Conidia were hyaline cylindrical with round ends, and measuring 14.90 - 18.19 µm × 4.05 - 6.20 µm (average ± SD, 16.22 ± 1.20 × 5.90 ± 0.84 µm) (n = 30). Appressoria were brown, globose to cylindrical, lobbed, and measuring 7.50 - 12.70 Page 1 of 5Pl an t D is ea se  "

The morphological characteristics of these isolates are consistent with some Colletotrichum species within the C. gloeosporioides complex including C. siamense (Weir et al. 2012; 
Afanador-Kafuri 2003). Isolate BRSP09 was used for molecular identification. Internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS), and genes encoding chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the Apn2– 
Mat1–2 intergenic spacer and partial mating type (Mat1–2) gene (ApMat) of the selected isolate (BRSP09) were amplified using primers ITS1F/ITS4, Bt2a/Bt-2b, CHS-79F/CHS 354R, ACT512F/ACT783R, CL1C/CL2C and AM-F/AM-R, respectively (Silva et al. 2012; 
Weir et al. 2012). Sequencing of the purified Polymerase Chain Reaction products were performed by Macrogen Inc., Korea, and sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession 
Nos. LC420017 -LC420022). Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) v. 6.0. (Tamura et al. 2013) based on the multilocus alignment (ITS, TUB2, ACT, CHS-1, CAL, and ApMat) of the present isolate and related Colletotrichum spp. sequences previously deposited in the 
GenBank. BLAST search and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate BRSP09 from ‘Strawberry Festival’ is C. siamense (Appendix 1c-d) (Mills et al. 1992). To confirm the pathogenicity of the fungus, ten three-month-old tissue-cultured ‘Strawberry Festival’ plants were inoculated by dipping the roots and crowns into either a 300 ml of conidial suspension (with 8 × 10 6  conidia/ml) of the isolates BRSP08 and BRSP09 or into sterile distilled water (control) for 30 min. The inoculated plants were transplanted into plastic pots with artificial peat-based soil mix and maintained in the greenhouse with 28°C and 20°C day and night temperature, respectively. The experiment was conducted twice. After 4 weeks, all plants inoculated with isolates BRSP08 or BRSP09 were stunted and developed typical wilt symptoms similar to those observed in the field (Appendix 1c), while the control plants remained healthy. C. siamense was re-isolated from crown tissues with typical ACR symptom, and identified using morphological and molecular methods mentioned above fulfilling Koch’s postulates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose crown rot of strawberry caused by C. siamense, the members of C. siamense complex in Rajshahi District of Bangladesh.
