For the past two decades, the causal agent of anthrac nose occurring on strawberry in Korea was considered
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, the recent mole cular analysis has shown that the genus Colletotrichum has undergone many taxonomic changes with introduc tion of several new species. As a result, it revealed that
C. gloeosporioides indeed consisted of more than 20 distinct species. Therefore, the Korean pathogen iso lated from strawberry should be reclassified. The shape and size of the conidia of the pathogen were not distinct ly different from those of C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola, but it differed in shape of the appressoria. A combined sequence analysis of partial actin, glycer aldehydes-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, and the internal transcribed spacer regions showed that the strawberry isolates formed a monophyletic group with authentic strains of C. fructicola. On the basis of these results, the anthracnose fungi of the domestic strawberry in Korea were identified as C. fructicola and distin guished from C. gloeosporioides.
Keywords : anthracnose, Colletotrichum fructicola, straw berry 
Anthracnose crown rot, to which all currently grown straw berry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) cultivars are susceptible, is a major disease in over 30% of nurseries and after trans planting stage in Korea (Nam et al., 2009). The causal pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was first reported by Kim et al. (1992).
C. gloeosporioides that occurs in many crops is a species aggregate containing a number of polymorphic subgroups which show varying degrees of pathogenicity, host-specifi city and genetic homogeneity (Hyde et al., 2009a). How ever, the recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides has enabled accurate classification by comparative analysis with pathogens isolated from the various plants (Cannon et al., 2008). The sequence analysis of the type strains was an important element in the research of identification and phylogenetic relationship of Colletotrichum (Cai et al., 2009; Phoulivong et al., 2010). Anthracnose pathogens, previously reported to be Colletotrichum sp., that occur on coffee in Thailand were shown as three new species of C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense based on the multi gene sequence analysis and morphological characteristics (Prihastuti et al., 2009). In the past few years, anthracnose pathogens from tropical fruits, which were identified as C. gloeosporioides based on their morphological characteristics, are subdivided into C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. horii, C. kahawae, and C. gloeosporioides by comparing of the nucleotide sequences with that of the C. gloeosporioides epitype (Phoulivong et al., 2010). As a result, many species of Colletotrichum, including C. gloeosporioides, have been defined, mainly based on the results of molecular phylo genetic analysis (Damm et al., 2010). Although the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence do not separate C. gloeo sporioides complex, some single genes or combinations of genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glutamine synthetase, can be used to reliably distinguish most taxa (Weir et al., 2012).
Therefore, C. gloeosporioides, previously reported patho gen on strawberries in Korea, is necessary to re-evaluate, taking into account the changed species boundary and the recent phylogenetic results of the genus Colletotrichum. 
Isolation and culture of strains. Eleven strains isolated from strawberry plants from 2005 to 2011 (Table 1).
Diseased petiole, roots, and crown tissues were surface sterilized by dipping in 2% NaOCl for 2 min, rinsed thrice with sterile water, and dried on sterile tissue paper. Samples were then placed on water agar and incubated at 27 oC. The growing edges of any fungal hyphae developing from the tissue were then transferred aseptically to potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA). Single spore iso lations were also carried out using the procedure described *Corresponding author.

Note Open Access 318 Nam et al. by Prihastuti et al. (2009). Pure cultures were stored at 4 oC on PDA slants.
Pathogenicity test. Each isolated pathogen was prepared at 1 × 105 conidia/mL and spayed 1 mL per plant on the 
Seolhyang cultivar of strawberry plants. Six plants per an isolate were used for test. The inoculated plants were incubated in a dew plastic house at 27 oC and 100% relative humidity (RH) for 2 days and then moved to a plastic house held between 24 oC and 30 oC. After 60 days, disease index on each plant was rated on a scale of 0–4: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% of petioles affected; 2, > 50% of petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on the entire plant (Nam et al., 2006). Disease index data from isolates were subjected to analysis of means and standard error. All data analysis was performed using the Costat program (CoHort software, 
Berkeley, CA). All isolates caused anthracnose symptoms on the Seolhyang strawberry cultivar (Table 1). Disease index of the isolates was the highest (DI > 3) for 
CGF071204, CGF100713, and CGF110101. Smith and 
Black (1990) showed that pathogenicity of C. gloeospori oides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae can be differentiated by factors such as strawberry tissue and cultivars. C. gloeo sporioides and C. acutatum were reported to have a wide host range, while C. fragariae were restricted to strawberry plants (Freeman et al., 1998; Hyde et al., 2009b). Colleto trichum isolated from strawberry in Korea and Japan was pathogenic to strawberry and apple fruit (Nam et al., 1998), and avocado, broad bean, common sowthistle, cyclamen, pea, and strawberry under non-wound inoculation condition (Okayama and Tsujimoto, 1994), respectively.

The colony diameters were measured daily for 7 days, and the growth rate for these 7 days was calculated as the average of mean daily growth (mm per day). The colors of the conidial masses and zonation were recorded at 7 days.
Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, in which a conidial suspension was placed in a hole on the glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The slide was placed in an empty Petri dish with wet filter paper and incubated at 28 oC for 2–4 days. Colonies of the isolates on 
PDA first appeared as white, then becoming grey to dark grey at the center over time, and growth rate was shown 9.98 ± 1.8 mm per day (Table 2). The shape and size of the conidia were cylindrical and 14.6 ± 0.47 × 3.99 ± 0.11 μm, respectively. The shape and size of the appressoria were ovoid, sometimes clavate and 9.93 ± 0.32 × 4.90 ± 0.10 μm, respectively (Table 2). Prihastuti et al.

Size of conidia and appressoria of the strawberry isolate differed from C. fragariae by Gunnell and Gubler (1992). Therefore, Colletotrichum isolates from strawberries in Korea were similar to C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola in shape and size of conidia, but the shape of the appressoria was close to C. fructicola rather than C. gloeosporioides.
Phylogenetic analysis. The sequences of eleven strains from strawberry and the ex-type or authentic strains of anthracnose available from GenBank (Table 3) were used in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted by using the method of Park et al. (2005). For the amplification of the 
ITS, partial actin (ACT), and GAPDH genes, 3 different primer sets were used: ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990); 
ACT512F and ACT783R (Prihastuti et al., 2009); and 
GDF1 and GDR1 (Peres et al., 2008); respectively. The am plification was performed with Maxime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PreMix (I-Taq, iNtRoN BioTechnology, 
Korea) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 pmol of each primer set and PCR conditions were performed as described by Prihastuti et al. (2009). PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified using a PCR quick-spin 
PCR product purification kit (iNtRON BioTechnology, 
Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The nucleotide sequences were determined by Bioneer Corpo ration (Chungwon, Korea). The sequences were proofread, edited, and merged onto comparable sequences using the 
PHYDIT program version 3.2 (Chun, 1995). To determine the phylogenetic positions of the Colletotrichum isolates, the alignments of the 3 gene sequence of 11 Korean isolates and 34 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank were performed with Clustal × 1.81 (Thompson et al., 1997).
Nucleotide sequences were aligned manually where necessary.
A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in MEGA v. 5.05, using TN93+I that was selected as the most suitable nucleotide mode by Modeltest (Tamura et al., 2011). Boot strap analysis was performed with 1,000 replications for branch stability. Sequences of ITS, ACT, and GAPDH regions of three isolates CGF080901, CGF090501, and 
CGF100713 were deposited in GenBank (JX125050, 
JX125051, and JX125052; KC283023, KC283024, and 
KC283025; KC283017, KC283018, and KC283019, respec tively).
PCR amplification of the ITS region generated 466 bp fragments for all isolates from strawberry plants. Sequence analysis of ITS region showed no sequence difference among all isolates and authentic of C. fructicola (ICMP 18581, ICMP 18646, and ICMP 17921) (data not shown).
PCR amplification of the ACT gene generated 217-226 bp fragments for all isolates from strawberry plants. Korean isolates present two haplotypes (K1 and K2) (Table 1). The 
ACT sequence of K1 (CGF050604 and CGF060617) differ ed from those of other nine Korean isolates (K2) by 3nt polymorphic characters at 14, 96, and 129 position and 7nt deletion at 23−29 position (Table 4). ACT sequence of K1 is identical to that of C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921 (syn.
Glomerella cingulate var. minor), whereas K2 showed a sequence similarity of 99.4% with C. fructicola ICMP 18646 (syn. C. ignotum).
PCR amplification of the GAPDH genes generated 232 bp fragments for all isolates. K1 differed from those of other 
Korean isolates (K2) by 3nt polymorphic characters at 47, 57 and 117 position (Table 4). GAPDH sequence of K1 showed a sequence similarity of 99.5% with that of C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921, whereas K2 showed a sequence similarity of 99.1% with C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and C. fructicola ICMP 18646.
The combined analysis showed that the 11 strains isolated from Korea formed a monophyletic group with authentic of 
C. fructicola (ICMP 18581, ICMP 18646, and ICMP 17921) and clearly distinct from other C. gloeosporioides complex (Fig. 1). All isolates were divided into two subgroups: one subgroup (K1) contained two Korean isolates and C. fructi cola strain ICMP 17921 with a bootstrap value of 77%. The other subgroup (K2) contained 9 Korean isolates and C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and C. fructicola ICMP 18646 with a bootstrap value of 63%.
Since C. fructicola was first isolated from the berries of 
Coffea arabica in the Chiang Mai region of Thailand (Prihastuti et al., 2009), it has been found in tropical fruits such as chili, papaya, and longan (Phoulivong et al., 2010).
Recently, G. cingulata var. minor and C. ignotum placed in synonymy with C. fructicola (Weir et al., 2012). K1 was

Colletotrichum Isolated from Strawberry 321 more closely related to C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921 (syn. G. cingulata var. minor) from Ficus than K2, whereas 
K2 grouped to C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and C. fructicola ICMP 18646 (syn. C. ignotum).
The Colletotrichum species isolated from strawberries worldwide are as follows: C. gloeosporioides (Gunnell and 
Gubler, 1992), C. fragariae (Smith et al., 1990), C. acutatum (Smith et al., 1986), C. dematium (Beraha and Wright, 1973), and Gloeosporium spp. (Wright et al., 1960), but as C. gloeosporioides (perfect stage: G. cingulata) in Korea (Kim et al., 1992; Nam et al., 1998). Three anthracnose stains (KACC 40695, KACC 40696, and KACC 40812) from strawberry plants stored in Korean Agricultural Culture 
Collection (KACC) were identified as C. gloeosporioides based on sequence analysis of ITS and partial β-tubulin gene and cultural characteristics (Kim et al., 2006). In ITS analysis, KACC 40695 and KACC 40812 formed the mono phyletic group with K2 and showed 100% sequence similarity among K2, while KACC 40696 was closely related to C. aenigma strain ICMP 18608, C. alienum strain ICMP 12071, and C. siamense ICMP 18578 (syn. C. hymenocallidis) and differed from ex-types of C. fructicola (data not shown). As we performed comparative analysis with three KACC strains using ITS sequence in the present study, phylogenetic analysis with combined genes will be needed to establish for accurate identification of the three stains. The C. frag ariae, originally reported as a disease of strawberry in 
Florida, USA (Brooks, 1931), placed in synonymy with C. theobromicola (Weir et al., 2012). All isolates from Korea were clearly distinguished from C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) based on morphological and molecular phylo genetic analysis.
In the present study, anthracnose fungi that occur in the domestic strawberry were identified as C. fructicola and
