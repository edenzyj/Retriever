Mango (Mangifera indica) is widely grown across southern China, especially in the provinces of Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, and
Taiwan. Guangxi itself has over 86,667 ha of mango production. The purpose of this study was to identify Colletotrichum species associated with mango in different parts of Guangxi and examine their pathogenicity on leaves and fruits of mango in vitro. Diseased leaves were collected from 25 mango orchards in different areas of Guangxi province. Sixty five isolates were obtained from mango leaves with anthracnose symp toms, and these were further characterized based on morphology and
DNA sequencing. Twenty-nine isolates from different areas were se lected for sequencing and analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, partial actin, b-tubulin, and chitin synthase genomic regions. The most common fungal isolates were these three species: Colletotrichum asianum,
C. fructicola, and C. siamense. C. asianum was the most common and widely distributed in Guangxi (51.7%), followed by C. fructicola (37.9%) and C. siamense (10.2%), both found in Tiandong, Tianyang, and Wuming counties. There was no evidence of geographical speciali zation of the different species. Pathogenicity assays showed that all iso lates were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruit (cultivar Tainong). No relationship was found between origin of isolates and their virulence.
This is the first description of C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense as causal agents of mango leaf anthracnose from Guangxi province,China.
Mango, Mangifera indica (L.), is considered one of the most im portant tropical or subtropical fruit crops (Nelson 2008). In China, mango is cultivated mainly in southern and southwestern provinces.
The planted area of mango was almost 130,000 ha, producing almost 900,000 tons in China during 2012 (Li et al. 2013). Guangxi province is the largest producing area of mango in China, and the mango indus try contributes significantly to the local economy of Guangxi (Li et al.
2013). Anthracnose disease of mango caused by several Colletotri chum species is considered the most important disease of mango in
China (Hong et al. 2016). Mango anthracnose is mainly caused by
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, but sometimes C. acutatum has also been reported as the causal agent (Freeman et al. 1998; Jayasinghe and
Fernando 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Mango anthracnose appears as irregularly shaped, black necrotic spots on upper and lower sides of mango leaves. Symptoms can also be found on stalks and flowers. Al thoughmany parts of the plant may be affected, themajor losses occur during ripening and postharvest, when black lesions appear on mango fruit surfaces (Arauz 2000; Freeman et al. 1998).
Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species is usually based on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009;
Photita et al. 2005), such as conidial morphological, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences are not sufficient to separate Colletotrichum species because there are differences for the same specimen when grown in the lab and under different growth conditions. Hence, molecular techniques are needed to separate species of Colletotrichum and to examine genetic variation within and between species and populations (Cai et al. 2009; Hyde et al.
2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Studies on the systematics of Colleto trichum species recently have placed species of this genus into nine major clades plus small clusters and isolated species, with clades probably representing species complexes (Cannon et al. 2012).
The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA has been frequently used to separate Colletotrichum species (Freeman et al.
2000) but not always satisfactorily (Cannon et al. 2012). Other markers, such as actin (ACT), b-tubulin (TUB2), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene have been used to resolve relationships among Colletotrichum spe cies (Weir et al. 2012). Considering recent changes in classification of Colletotrichum species, and the lack of information on the iden tity and characteristics of isolates causing mango anthracnose in
China, the objectives of this study were as follows: (i) identify and characterize species of Colletotrichum associated with mango anthracnose in Guangxi, China, based on morphology and DNA se quence comparisons; (ii) examine virulence of isolates from different parts of Guangxi province and whether there are geographical differ ences; and (iii) investigate relationships among isolates ofColletotrichum spp. from mango using sequences of ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, andGAPDH.Materials and Methods
Fungal isolation. Mango leaves with symptoms of anthracnose were collected from production fields of six counties (Tiandong,
Tianyang, Tianlin, Youjiang, Wuming, and Qinzhou) in Guangxi province, ranging over an area of 450 by 300 km. Small (3 × 3-mm) sections were cut from lesion margins and were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 15 s and 0.1% (v/v) mercuric chloride for 45 s, followed by rinses in sterile water. The sections were then plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C. Fungal growth was examined daily up to 14 days. Isolates were subcultured onto fresh PDA and purified by single-spore culture. Isolates were stored on PDA slants at 4°C.

Morphological characterization. Isolates were cultured on PDA plates at 25°C under continuous fluorescent light for 5 days. Plugs (6-mmdiameter) from colonymargins were placed in the center of each 90-mm-diameter plate with four replications. The colony color and culture diameters (two perpendicular directions) were recorded after 3, 7, and 10 days at 25°C. Colony diameters were used to calculate hyphal growth rate (mm/day). Isolates were incubated at 25°C for 21 days on PDA plates to examine conidial production and the shape and size of conidia. The length and width of 150 conidia per isolate were measured.
DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing. Isolates were cultured on PDA in Petri plates overlaid with cellophane for 7 days at 25°C. Mycelia were harvested with a flamed spatula, and genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted with the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method (Taylor et al.
1993). All strains in this study were subjected to analysis of the rDNA-ITS, partial GAPDH, partial ACT, partial TUB2, and partial
CHS-1 genomic regions (Table 1). PCR amplification of GAPDH was done using the primers GDF1 and GDR1 (Templeton et al.
1992) and that of CHS-1 with CHS79F and CHS354R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). The partial ACT, TUB2, and ITS regions were am plified with the primer pairs ACT512F and ACT783R (Carbone and
Kohn 1999), T1 and Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and ITS1 and
ITS4 (White et al. 1990), respectively. All PCR reactions were con ducted in 50-ml volumes containing 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM concen trations of each dNTP, 4 mMMgCl2, 0.5 mM concentrations of each

The amplification products were sent to Shanghai
Sangon Company for purification and sequencing. Sequences of mango Colletotrichum isolates obtained from Guangxi were submit ted to GenBank. Phylogenetic analyses. Sequences were edited and assembled using DNAMAN (version 5.2.2; Lynnon Biosoft) to produce con sensus sequences that were compared by BLAST (Altschul et al.
1990) against the NCBI nonredundant database. Sequences from extype or ex-epitype isolates of Colletotrichum species from GenBank were selected for use in the phylogenetic analyses (Table 2). Sequence alignments of each gene and combined genes weremadewithClustalX version 1.83. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA4 soft ware version 4.0 using the maximum parsimony method.
Pathogenicity and virulence on mango tissues. Select isolates were used for pathogenicity and virulence tests on detached fruits and leaves of mango (cultivar Tainong) in controlled conditions. Iso lates were incubated on PDA plates for 7 to 10 days at 25°C in the laboratory. Fresh young leaves and fresh harvested mango fruits without visible disease from Tiandong, Guangxi, were used for inoc ulation. The leaves and mango fruits were washed with running wa ter, surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 30 s and 1% NaClO for 1 min, and finally rinsed with sterile distilled water.
After air drying, detached young healthy leaves (12 to 15 cm) were placed into plastic containers (252 × 174 × 93 mm) lined with moist absorbent paper and, and six stab wounds were made in the midre gion forming a circle with a 5 mm diameter using a sterilized needle.
Hyphal plugs from actively growing margins of PDA cultures were placed on each wound spot on the leaves. The experiment was completely randomized with three replicates per isolate involving five leaves per replicate. Fifteen leaves were inoculated for each iso late, and in controls, leaves were treated with sterile agar plugs. The containers were partially sealed in plastic and incubated at 25°C in the dark in a growth chamber. Virulence was assessed by measuring lesion length at 7 days post inoculation (DPI) in two perpendicular directions on each leaf.
After washing and air drying, nearly ripened mango fruits (~200 g) were wounded in the protruding fleshy parts by stabbing with a flamed needle through the skin a depth of 3 mm, again forming a cir cle with a 5 mm diameter. Mycelial plugs of 6-mm diameter from
PDA cultures were placed on wound sites. Control treatments used sterile agar plugs. Inoculated fruits were placed in plastic containers (252 × 174 × 93mm) overlaid with moist absorbent paper to maintain humidity. The containers were placed in unsealed bags and incubated at 25°C in the dark. Fruits were checked for development of symptoms up to 10 days. Isolates were considered pathogenic when lesions ex panded beyond the 5-mm diameter initial wound site. Virulence was evaluated by measuring lesion length at 10 DPI in two perpendicular directions. Significant differences in virulence caused were assessed by an analysis of variance, and when significant treatment effects were found, means were compared by LSD (P = 0.05) using Data Process ing System software (DPS 3.0) for Windows (Zhejiang University,Hangzhou, China). Results
Fungal isolation. From 2011 to 2014, leaves of mango with anthracnose symptoms were collected from 25 mango orchards in
Guangxi province, China. At least one isolate from each field was chosen for further analysis. In total, 65 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from different areas of Guangxi, and 29 single-spore

Plant Disease / July 2018 1285 isolates were used for further study (Table 3) (one isolate from each orchard, but for some large orchards more than one isolate was chosen for further study). Among the 29 isolates, 15 were identified as C. asianum, 11 as C. fructicola, and 3 as C. siamense using mor phological and molecular methods. Other species isolated such as species of Alternaria, Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria, or Pestalotia were not considered further in this study.
Phylogenetic analyses. In the present study, 29 isolates from dif ferent areas were selected for sequencing and analyses of ITS,
GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, and CHS-1. BLASTn searches of generated
DNA sequences from 15 isolates against GenBank showed high sim ilarity (>99%) with the sequences of C. asianum, 11 isolates showed high similarity with the sequences of C. fructicola, and 3 isolates showed high similarity (99 or 100%)with the sequences ofC. siamense.

ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences of Colletotri chum from mango trees in Guangxi province were submitted to
GenBank (Table 3) and aligned with GenBank sequences of Colleto trichum species from different hosts and other countries (Table 2).
The gene boundaries in the alignment were as follows: ACT (282 to 289 bp), TUB2 (699 to 701 bp), CHS-1 (299 bp), GAPDH (277 to 280 bp), and ITS (546 bp).
A phylogenetic tree of 29 Colletotrichum isolates from this study and sequences from extype or ex-epitype isolates from GenBank us ing combined ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, and CHS-1 genes with maximum parsimony analysis is shown in Figure 1. The combined data set produced three well-separated clades. FifteenColletotrichum isolates composed a highly supported clade (99% bootstrap support) with C. asianum isolates ICMP18580 from Coffea arabica in Thai land and IMI313839 from Mangifera indica in Australia. Eleven isolates composed a supported clade (69% bootstrap support) with 
C. fructicola isolates ICMP18727, ICMP18613, and ICMP12568 and
C. ignotum (= C. fructicola) isolates ICMP125397 and UASB-Cg-50. Three isolates composed a supported clade (51% bootstrap support), which closed with C. siamense isolate ICMP17795. The diversity analyses from 29 isolates of Colletotrichum species showed the following distribution: 15 isolates (51.7%) belonging to C. asianum, 11 isolates (37.9%) to C. fructicola, and 3 isolates (10.2%) to C. siamense.
Morphological and cultural characterization.All tested isolates developed white colonies that turned to gray to black after 14 days on
PDA (Fig. 2). Colony sectoring was observed in 8 of 29 isolates.
There was considerable variation in mycelial growth rate among the 29 isolates of Colletotrichum (Table 2). The average mycelial growth rate forC. asianumwas 6.7 to 10.7 mm/day, forC. fructicola, 7.3 to 12.4 mm/day, and for C. siamense, 9.4 to 11.1 mm/day.
Conidia were all hyaline, guttulate, one-celled, and cylindrical. The

Plant Disease / July 2018 1287 average conidial sizes for isolates wereC. asianum, 12.1 to 18.6 × 4.2 to 5.6 mm; C. fructicola, 14.1 to 20.2 × 3.7 to 4.3 mm; and C. sia mense, 15.0 to 18.5 × 5.0 to 5.5mm. The various Colletotrichum spe cies reported here showed differences in conidial size and growth rates (Table 4).
Pathogenicity and virulence in tissues. All 29 tested isolates were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits. Ripened fruits with an thracnose develop sunken, dark brown to black decay. The virulence of the 29 isolates of Colletotrichum from Guangxi province showed significant differences, with lesion diameters ranging from 7.0 to 30.0 cm on leaves and from 6 to 21 mm on fruits. The lesion diameter of C. asianum on leaves ranged from 9.2 to 28.2 mm and on fruits ranged from 6.2 to 21 mm. For C. fructicola it was 8.8 to 30.0 mm on leaves and 5.8 to 13.6 mm on fruits. For C. siamense it was 7.0 to 22.2 mm on leaves and 6.0 to 6.5 mm on fruits. The virulence of C. fructicola isolates TD1 and TD4 from the same field showed significant differences (P # 0.05) (Table 4).Discussion
This is the first report characterizing Colletotrichum species asso ciated with anthracnose of mango in Guangxi province, China, using morphological identification and phylogenetic analysis. The mor phological features of the isolates agreed with the description of
C. gloeosporioides, but cultural characteristics, which may be diverse owing to cultural conditions, and conidial morphology cannot distin guish between species within the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012). Based on morphological identification, single gene se quence analysis, and the five-gene combined phylogenetic analysis, the isolates obtained from mango in Guangxi included in this study belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex. C. gloeosporioides has previously been shown to be the causal agent of tropical fruit rots in cludingmango, and the present study showed that all 29 isolates from mango leaves with anthracnose symptoms across a 450 by 300 km region belonged to the species complex C. gloeosporioides. In the contrast, Phoulivong et al. (2010) reported that C. gloeosporioides was not a common pathogen in the tropics and was not the cause of mango anthracnose in Thailand or Laos. The species complex C. gloeosporioides has been separated into many different species (Weir et al. 2012). Three species were found to be associated with mango leaf anthracnose: C. asianum, C. fructi cola, and C. siamense. These species have also been previously recorded from mango in Brazil (Phoulivong et al. 2010). Among the genomic regions tested, C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense could be separated by all except for ITS. This does not agree with the results of Weir et al. (2012), who found C. asianum can be separated from these other taxa using any of the genes tested, including ITS. ITS sequences do not reliably separate C. asianum, C. siamense, and
C. fructicola, butC. siamense andC. fructicola can be distinguished us ing TUB2, and this agrees with the previous reports (Weir et al. 2012).
C. asianum was well separated using five-gene combined phylo genetic analysis in this study, and it was the predominant species as sociated with mango in Guangxi, South China, in agreement with
Vieira et al. (2014), who found that C. asianum was the most com mon endophytic species from mango trees. C. asianum is a well known pathogen of mangoes from India, Australia, Panama, andThailand (Sharma et al. 2015).

C. fructicola is diverse morphologically and geographically. The species has been found on coffee berries (Thailand), Pyrus pyrifolia (Japan), Limonium (Israel), Malus sp. and Fragaria × ananassa (U.S.A.), Persea americana (Australia), Ficus sp. (Germany), Malus sp. (Brazil), Dioscorea sp. (Nigeria), Theobroma sp. and Tetragastris sp. (Panama) (Weir et al. 2012), and Vitis sp. (China) (Peng et al.
2013). C. fructicola has been described in association with mango in
Brazil and Korea (Joa et al. 2016); however, this is the first report of
C. fructicola infecting mango in China. C. ignotum = C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), and our genetic analyses showed the isolates from these two species were in one clade but two subgroups.
C. siamense has been associated with mango anthracnose in 
Colombia (Pardo-De la Hoz et al. 2016) and on mango fruit (Qin et al. 2017) in Sanya, Hainan province, China, and also in postharvest of mango fruits from supermarkets in Changchun, northeast China (Liu et al. 2017), but this species is not common on mango in
Guangxi province, and only three isolates were found to be C. sia mense. In this study, this species was not well separated from the
C. gloeosporioides complex with the combined five genes, and more genes may be needed in future study.
Pathogenicity tests using three species of Colletotrichum isolates showed that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits in wound-inoculation studies. Symptoms may vary considerably with factors such as variety and conditions of the fruit, humidity and temperature, and the inoculum concentration (Freeman et al. 1998).
Hence, the observations from this study may not reflect the full vir ulence potential. Additional research should be conducted to deter mine the virulence potential of Colletotrichum species under field conditions with natural inoculum rather than just in vitro artificial inoculation.
The Colletotrichum isolates from mango examined in this study showed diversity based on sequence analysis and morphological fea tures. Higher genetic diversity is often correlated with higher evolution ary potential andwith greater ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions (McDonald and Linde 2002). In addition, sensitivity of
C. gloeosporioides andC. acutatum species frommango to carbendazim and thiabendazole are significantly different from each other in China (Hu et al. 2005). Such information can be used by pathologists and breeders to develop strategies and cultivars towardmore effective man agement of mango anthracnose disease. Future studies should focus on surveys of more isolates and tests on other features such as fun gicide sensitivity.Literature Cited
