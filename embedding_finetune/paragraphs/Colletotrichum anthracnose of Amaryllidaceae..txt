Amaryllidaceae. Fungal Diversity 39: 123-146.  
Twenty strains representing eight species of Colletotrichum were isolated from lesions of various species of amaryllids (monocotyledons, Amaryllidaceae) in Yunnan, Guangxi and Guizhou Provinces in China and Chiang Rai Province, 
Thailand. They are characterized through morphological studies and from phylogenetic analyses based on actin, β tubulin (tub 2), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase A (CHS I), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) and the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequence data. Colletotrichum cliviae, C. hippeastri and C. hymenocallidis are new species described and illustrated in this paper based on morphological characters and multi gene sequence data. Pathogenicity testing indicated that the three new taxa from Amaryllidaceae are not host-specific.

Colletotrichum is among the most im portant genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide and species cause disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Some of the better known species include Colletotrichum linde muthianum (Sacc. & Magnus) Briosi & Cavara, 
C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc., C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds ex J.H. Simmonds, C. falcatum Went, C. nupharicola D.A. Johnson, 
Carris & J.D. Rogers and C. nymphaeae (Pass.) 
Aa. Some plant pathogenic species have high significance to quarantine because they could be introduced into countries where the disease does not occur (Farr et al., 2006). 
The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum is confused (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthrac nose was found on a host substratum for which no records of that fungus/host relationship were known, then the species was interpreted as new, and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). 
This practice was later rejected (von Arx 1957; 
Sutton 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), but new species are still occasionally described in 
Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Naka nura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). There are now more than 688 epithets listed in Index fungorum (www. index fungorum.org/names /names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum each with a short description.  
In recent years, molecular tools have been employed to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morpho logical characteristics, some species have been segregated from the Colletotrichum gloeo sporioides complex, such as C. boninense 
Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib. which has been 124 shown to cause disease of eight host plants in 
Japan (Moriwaki et al., 2003). Although ITS sequence data may help in Colletotrichum species identification, it cannot alone be used to adequately address species delimitation for closely related species (Crouch et al., 2009a). 
Researchers have recently tried to examine multiple genes sequence data to distinguish species in Colletotrichum (Du et al., 2005; 
Johnston et al., 1997; Crouch et al., 2006, 2009b,c; Farr et al., 2006; Shenoy et al., 2007a,b; Than et al., 2008a,b; Moriwaki and 
Tsukiboshi, 2009). Using multilocus phyloge netics, Crouch et al. (2006; 2009b) separated C. cereale and C. eleusines from C. graminicola and introduced six new Colletotrichum species from warm-season grass hosts. Multigene sequence analyses are helpful in clarifying the confusion in the Colletotrichum systematics.  
Amaryllids (members of the Amaryllida ceae) are bulbous herbs with distichous or rarely rosulate leaves and a lateral, solid, naked scape which is terminated by an umbel-like cluster of showy flowers (Meerow et al., 1998). 
Several amaryllids have economic value as medicine, while species and/or hybrids of 
Nerine, Amaryllis and Crinum are cultivated in many countries for their elegant flowers (Dahlgren et al., 1985). 
Colletotrichum species causing anthrac nose on Amaryllidaceae have been reported from Japan (Horie et al., 1990; Moriwaki et al., 2003) and China (Liu et al., 2000). The disease symptoms include depressed reddish brown lesions on leaves or scapes, limiting the com mercial production of ornamental and medici nal plants (Liu et al., 2000). Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib.,  
C. crassipes (Speg.) Arx, C. dematium (Pers.) 
Grove and C. capsici (Syd.) E.J. Butler & 
Bisby have been reported to infect Amaryllis sp., Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum and Clivia miniata (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003; http://194.203.77.76/herbIMI/Name.asp). In this study we use combined morphological and molecular characteristics to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in China and Thailand. Materials and methods  Isolation of Colletotrichum 
Colletotrichum samples were collected from anthracnose lesions on Clivia, Crinum, 
Hippeastrum, Hymenocallis (Amaryllidaceae) in Guangxi, Guizhou and Yunnan provinces, 
China and Chiang Rai Province, Thailand from 
June 2008 to September 2009 (Table 3). Isola tion was carried out through two methods depending on the status of fungal sporulation. 
Isolates were obtained from lesions without visible sporulation using the procedure des cribed by Photita et al. (2005). Single-spore isolations from infected leaves or scapes with sporulation were also carried out using the procedure described by Choi et al. (1999). 
Spore masses were picked up with a sterilized wire loop and streaked on to the surface of water agar (WA) plates which were then incubated overnight. A single germinated spore was picked up with a sterilized needle and transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). 
Pure cultures were stored at 4°C on PDA slants. 
Isolates were deposited in Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China and Mae Fah 
Luang University (MFLU) Culture Collection and National Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC), Thailand.  
Morphological and cultural characterization 
Starter cultures were prepared by plating each isolate onto PDA at 25°C. Five 4 mm plugs were aseptically cut from actively sporu lating areas near the growing edge of a 5-day old culture of each isolate using a sterile cork borer. Each plug was placed onto PDA plates (Petri dishes diameter: 90 × 15 mm) and grown in alternating 12 hours near UV/12 hours dark at 25ºC (Sutton, 1980). Colony diameter was measured at day six (for the fastest growing cultures, at day four). Growth rate was calcu lated as the 6-day or 4-day average of mean daily growth (mm per day). After 7-10 days, size and shape of 50 conidia harvested from culture were assessed. The colour of the coni dial masses and zonation were recorded at day seven. Mycelial appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique (Sutton, 1980), 
Fungal Diversity   125 where 10 mm squares of potato carrot agar (PCA) were placed in an empty Petri dish, the edge of the PCA was inoculated with small sections of mycelia, and a cover slip was placed over the inoculated agar. After 5-14 days, appressoria formed across the underside of the cover slip and their shape and size were then recorded. Conidial appressoria of some strains with cylindrical spores were also recorded. Conidial appressoria were induced by inoculating with conidia in two drops of distilled water on a microscope slide, then placing it inside Petri dishes containing moistened cotton with distilled sterile water, and incubated at 25ºC in darkness. After incubating 24 hours, conidial appressoria were formed from germ tube and then measured.  DNA extraction and sequencing 
DNA was extracted from all isolates growing on PDA at room temperature for 8-10 days using a modified protocol of Chen et al. (2007). The gene regions were amplified using the primers listed in Table 1. The PCR amplifi cations were performed in a 25 µl mixture containing 9.5µl ddH2O, 12.5 µl 2×PCR 
Master Mix (TIANGEN Co. China), 1 µl of 
DNA templates, 1 µl of each primers (10 µM). 
The reactions were performed with a thermal cycler (MyclerTM, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, 
USA) using the following thermal program: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C for 30 s), annealing (30 s at 59°C for Actin, CAL and β-tubulin, 56°C for 
GPDH and CHS I, and 53°C for ITS), elongation (72°C for 90 s), and a final 7 min extension at 72°C. PCR products were examined by electrophoresis stained with ethidium bromide, and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions of a TIANGEL 
Mini Purification kit (TIANGEN Co. China).  
Purified samples were sequenced using the above-mentioned PCR primers in an Applied 
Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzers at Sino max Co., China. Two of gene amplicon, CAL and β-tubulin, were cloned into DH5α (TIANGEN Co., China) with pMD18-T vector (Takara), and then sequenced at the same company.  
Molecular phylogenetic analysis 
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using six gene regions. The accession numbers of all sequences are listed in Table 3. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using 
ClustalX 2.0.10 (Larkin et al., 2007). Gaps were treated as missing data. 
Each of the single and combined sequence alignments were analyzed using maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP* 4b10. 
Ambiguously aligned regions were excluded from all analyses. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with tree bisection reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were unlimited, branches of zero length were collapsed and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics such as tree length [TL], consistency index [CI], retention index [RI], rescaled consistency index [RC], and homoplasy index [HI] were calcu lated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. Clade stability of the trees resulting from the parsimony analyses were assessed by bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Trees were figured in Treeview. 
When analyzing ITS and β-tubulin sequence, some reference sequences were obtained from GeneBank (Table 2). 
The model of evolution was estimated by using Mrmodeltest 2.2 (Nylander, 2004). 
Posterior probabilities (PP) (Rannala and Yang, 1996; Zhaxybayeva and Gogarten, 2002) were  determined by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC) in MrBayes 3.0b4 (Huel senbeck and Ronquist, 2001). Six simultaneous 
Markov chains were run for 3,000,000 genera tions and trees were sampled every 100th generations (resulting 30,000 total trees). The first 2,000 trees, which represented the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded and the remaining 28,000 trees were used for calculating posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree.  
Pathogenicity testing and host range 
A representative isolate of each species from Amaryllidaceae was selected for patho- genicity testing (Table 6). For testing the host range, 12 plant species were selected belonging to 6 families (Table 6), most being hosts of 
Colletotrichum species that are morphologi cally similar to our isolates from Amaryllida ceae. Single spore cultures of each isolate were 126

Spores were then harvested by adding 10 ml of sterilized distilled water onto the culture, which was then gently swirled to dislodge the conidia with the concentration adjusted to 106conidia/ml using a haemocytometer, and used as the standard inoculum for pathogenicity and host range testing. The conidial suspension was filtered through two layers of muslin cloth (Than et al., 2008a). Healthy leaves or fruits were picked and washed with tap water; and then disinfected in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5-7 minutes (disinfection time was adjusted according to whether the surface was smooth or coarse). Disinfected leaves and fruits were washed three times with distilled, sterilized water, and then dried with sterilized filter paper. 
Leaves or fruits were kept individually in a 12 cm diam Petri dish or tissue culture bottle (for tomato and grape fruit) with a swab of cotton wall (about 1 cm in diam.) containing distilled water to maintain humidity. 
The inoculation method has been described by Than et al. (2008a). The wound /drop inoculation method involved pin pricking the leaf or fruit wall to a 1 mm depth and then placing 6 µl of conidia suspension (106coni dia/ml) onto the wound /non wound. Control fruits and leaves were inoculated with 6 µl of sterilized, distilled water onto the wound. Each plant was inoculated with four replicates per selected strain. The inoculated fruits and leaves were then incubated at 25°C for 24 hours and then at room temperature (22-27°C). After 6-7 days and 14-15 days of incubation leaves and fruits were checked for lesions with a stereo microscope on a superclean bench. Spore masses or acervuli on leaves or fruits were checked with a compound microscope and spores were transferred to PDA medium, and then incubated at 25°C for checking the colony and spore characters. All infected leaves or fruits were sterilized and then disposed.  Results  
Collection of Colletotrichum species 
Colletotrichum isolates used in this study are listed in Table 3. Twenty strains of 
Colletotrichum were isolated from anthracnose associated with Clivia, Crinum, Hippeastrum and Hymenocallis (Amaryllidaceae). Morpho logical examination classified twenty isolates into 6 morphogroups; while analysis of ITS sequence reveal 8 phylogenetic lineages (see below). For comparison, reference strains of several important Colletotrichum species were included in this study including Colletotrichum simmondsii R.G. Shivas & Y.P. Tan (holotype, 
BRIP 28519), C. truncatum (Schwein.) Andrus & W.D. Moore (CBS 120709), C. coccodes (Wallr.) S. Hughes (CPOS1), C. gloeospor ioides (epitype, CBS 953.97) and C. trichellum (Fr.) Duke (HKUCC 10378).  Phylogenetic analysis 
The ITS dataset comprised 570 charac ters after alignment, of which 138 characters were parsimony informative (24.2%). The 
Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test showed that 556 trees generated from parsimonious analysis were not significantly different. One of the most parsimonious trees (TL =549, CI = 0.692, 
RI = 0.867, RC = 0.600, HI = 0.308) (Table 4.) is shown in Fig. 1. The dataset of combined six genes comprised 2973 characters after align Fungal Diversity   127

Abbreviation: NPIC, Number of (included) parsimony informative characters.  ment, of which, 1081 characters were parsi mony informative (36.3%). KH tested showed that 2 trees inferred from parsimonious analysis were not significantly different. The phylo grams deduced from dataset of combined six gene regions is shown in Fig. 2, and descriptive tree statistics are listed in Table 4. The phylograms inferred from single gene Actin, 
CHS I, β-tubulin, CAL and GPDH show essentially similar topology as that from ITS and combined datasets and are, therefore, not shown. 
The isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose on Amaryllidaceae clustered into 8 clades based on phylograms inferred from ITS region (Fig. 1). Clade 1 was mono phyletic with high bootstrap support (97%) and comprised isolates CSSX3, CSSX5 and 
CSSX10 representing Colletotrichum spaethia num (Allescher) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous. 
Isolates CSSK4, CSSS1 and CSSS2 constituted another monophyletic lineage (clade 2) with 100% bootstrap support and appeared as a sister clade to Colletotrichum orbiculare (Berk. & Mont.) Arx. Isolates CSSG1 and CSSG2 clustered in the monophyletic clade 3 with 96% bootstrap support and appeared basal to 
Colletotrichum boninense. Isolates CSSN1 and 
CSSX8 clustered with two strains of Colletotri chum boninense (holotype and paratype) from 
Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum in clade 4 with 92% bootstrap support. Clade 5 (100%) included isolates CSSX2, CSSX4, CSSX9, 
CSST3 and CSST5. These five strains formed a distinct lineage together with two strains of 
Colletotrichum truncatum (CBS151.35 (epi type) and CBS120709). Isolates CSST1 and 
CSST4 clustered with the type specimens of 
Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & 
K.D. Hyde (Clade 6). In addition, the phylo genetic position of isolates CSSX7, CSSN2 and CSSN3 remain uncertain in the ITS tree, in which, CSSX7 were close to C. fructicola 
Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde. 
Phylograms inferred from CAL gene sequences delimited isolate CSSX7 together with C. fructicola (strain BPD-I16, holotype) in a distinct lineage (clade 7) with 96% bootstrap. 
In phylograms inferred from CHS I, as compared to that from ITS, clades 1-6 are very similar. The phylograms indicated that isolates 
CSSN2 and CSSN3 represented a separate lineage (clade 8) with 67% bootstrap support. 
In addition, the bootstrap support for clade 6 (CSST1 and CSST4) is higher than that inferred from ITS (89% vs 58%). The position  of isolate CSSX7 was not resolved in this single gene tree (trees not shown). 
Phylograms inferred from combined da tasets of Actin, β-tubulin, CHS I, CAL, GPDH and the ITS regions support eight well-defined clades (Fig. 2), representing eight distinct species. Clades 1 to 6 correspond with phylo grams constructed using ITS and CHS I. The bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probabilities of the six clades are also very high (equal or above 98%). Isolate CSSX7 represented a distinct clade (clade 7) with 100% bootstrap support. In addition, isolates CSSN2 and 
CSSN3 also represents a distinct clade (clade 8) with 95% bootstrap support and 100% Baye sian posterior probabilities (Fig. 2). Clades 1, 4, 5, 6 and 7 are Colletotrichum spaethianum,

Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib. 
This species occurs on leaves of Crinum asiaticum as reddish brown, ellipsoid to irregular spots and forms pink conidial masses with rare setae (Fig. 6A). In this study, although the conidia of C. boninense (CSSN1 and CSSX8) are wider than those of the holotype and paratype, their shape and cultural characteristics are similar and they cluster in one clade with high bootstrap support (there is one base difference in the ITS sequence among them and the holotype). In addition, the holotype and paratype of C. boninense was collected from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum in Japan.

Pathogenicity testing and host range 
The three new species are not host specific (Table 6). Isolate CSSN2 (Colletotri chum hymenocallidis) from Hymenocallis americana can infect fruits of Capsicum annuum and Lycopersicon esculentum by wound/drop inoculation forming salmon-pink conidial masses, without setae. Both non wound/drop and wound/drop inoculation re sulted in leaf infection of Hymenocallis americana, with similar symptoms to the field infection. Isolate CSSG1 (Colletotrichum hippeastri) from Hippeastrum vittatum caused disease on the leaves of Crinum asiaticum by wound/drop inoculation. Reddish brown spots formed with acervuli and few setae on Crinum asiaticum leaves. Isolate CSSK4 (Colletotri chum cliviae) can infect Bletilla striata by wound/drop inoculation resulting in numerous pale yellow conidial masses on the leaves. In addition, CSSK4 can infect Crinum asiaticum by non-wound/drop and wound/drop inoculation forming a similar symptom as that in field.  Discussion  
The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryl lidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, 
Thailand based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data. A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), in which a polyphasic approach is suggested since single phenotypic character has been proven to be inadequate to differentiate Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In the current study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morph-types using morpho logical characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages but with low support for 2 clades. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight, well-supported, distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa and these met the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). 
Four of the species had type or epitype data in 
GeneBank, which was used for comparison. 
Three species are described as new species, and each taxon is uniquely characterized by the Fungal Diversity   141

Species of Colletotrichum on Amaryllidaceae 
Colletotrichum boninense (MAFF 3060 94, CBS 119185, CBS 241.78), C. capsici (IMI 233426; synonymy, C. truncatum (Hyde et al., 2009)), C. crassipes (IMI 165604, IMI 304052,IMI 259839) and C. dematium (IMI 208403, IMI 124329) have been previously recorded from Amaryllidaceae anthracnose (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003; http:// www.cbs.knaw.nl/fungi/BioloMICS.aspx, http: //194.203.77.76/herbIMI/Name.asp). Colleto trichum boninense was reported as the causal agent of anthracnose on Dracaena sanderiana and Euonymus japonica (Lee et al., 2005; Farr et al., 2006), and an endophyte on a number of hosts worldwide (Lu et al., 2004). Recent indications are that C. boninense may be a species complex (P.W. Crous and R.G. Shivas, pers. comm.). Colletotrichum capsici and C. dematium also cause disease of a number of host plants from tropical to temperate regions (Sutton, 1992; Hyde et al., 2009; Damm et al., 2009). In this study, C. dematium and C. crassipes were not encountered. Six other taxa, 
Colletotrichum cliviae, C. fructicola, C. hippeastri, C. hymenocallidis, C. siamense and 
C. spaethianum, were recorded for the first 142

Phoulivong et al., pers. comm.).  
Justification of new species   Colletotrichum cliviae 
Colletotrichum cliviae is similar to C. boninense, C. crassipes and C. orbiculare in conidial width. However, conidial shape is different; conidia of C. crassipes are truncate at the base while those of C. boninense have a hilum-like low protuberance at the base (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003). In addition, 
Colletotrichum cliviae grows faster in culture than C. orbiculare and C. boninense (15.2-16 mm/day in C. cliviae vs 10.4-12.2 mm/day in C. boninense and 5.1-5.3 mm/day in C. orbiculare) (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003; Asakura et al., 2009). In the phylogram derived from single and combined multi-gene dataset, three 
C. cliviae isolates clustered together and phylogenetically separated from above mor phologically similar species (Figs 1, 2).  Colletotrichum hippeastri  
Conidia of Colletotrichum hippeastri overlap in size with those of C. dracaeno philum D.F. Farr & M.E. Palm, C. sansevieriae 
M. Nakamura & M. Ohzono and C. nupha ricola D.A. Johnson, Carris & J.D. Rogers (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; 
Nakamura et al., 2006). Colletotrichum hippea 
Fungal Diversity   143 stri differs in several other characters (Table 7). 
In C. hippeastri the conidia are distinct in being usually narrower near each end or at the centre, while the conidia of C. dracaenophilum and C. nupharicola do not narrow (Johnson et al. 1997; 
Farr et al., 2006). Germinating conidia of C. hippeastri form 2-4 cells (Fig. 4), a character distinct from other species of Colletotrichum. 
The conidia of C. nupharicola become 2-celled and secondary conidia form from germ tubes (Johnson et al., 1997). The appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. nupharicola (10.5-17.5 × 8-12.5 µm vs. 6-10 × 7-9 µm), and they are irregular, crenate or lobed (Figs 4H, I, K-N), whereas those of C. nupharicola are ovoid to clavate. The conidia of C. hippeastri are longer than those of C. sansevieriae (mean 29.2 × 8.8 µm vs 18.4 × 6.4 µm). In addition, C. sansevieriae is highly host specific to Sansevieria (Nakamura et al., 2006). 
Colonies of C. hippeastri grow faster than those of C. dracaenophilum, C. sansevieriae or 
C. nupharicola, and other colony characters are also different (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2006) (Table 7). 
Because the ITS sequence of C. sansevieriae is very short (159 bases pairs, in GeneBank), we did not include these sequences in our ITS phylogenetic analysis. The ITS2 of C. hippeastri and of C. sansevieriae (AB212991, strain:Sa-1-2; MAFF239721, ex-holotype) have nineteen base differences. Finally, C. hippeastri clustered separately from C. dracaenophilum in phylograms inferred from ITS sequences (Fig. 1).  Colletotrichum hymenocallidis 
The conidial size and shape of Colleto trichum hymenocallidis is similar to that of C. siamense, however, their colony characters is different; reverse of C. siamense is yellowish white while that of C. hymenocallidis is greenish black. The conidial and mycelial appressorium in C. hymenocallidis are larger than those of C. siamense (Prihastuti et al., 2009) (Table 5). Based on the phylograms deduced from CHS I and combined datasets of six genes, they occur in two different clades (Fig. 2). Although the conidial size and shape in C. gloeosporioides is similar to C. hymeno callidis, the latter grows slower than C. gloeosporioides under the same conditions (10 mm/d in C. hymenocallidis versus 26.5 mm/d in C. gloeosporioides) (Cannon et al., 2008). In the single and combined gene trees, C. hymeno callidis formed a distinct lineage separated from C. gloeosporioides (Figs. 1, 2).  
Comparison of conidial appressoria with mycelial appressoria 
Appressorium shape and size are im portant characters for species identification in 
Colletotrichum (von Arx, 1957; Johnston and 
Jones, 1997; Crouch et al., 2009b;), and both conidial and mycelial appressoria have been induced and characterized in various studies (Sutton, 1980, 1992; Johnston and Jones, 1997; 
Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001; 
Crouch et al., 2009 b). In the present study, we tried inducing both conidial and mycelial appressoria but mycelial appressoria often failed to develop. Conidial appressoria were usually smaller and had less variation in shape than mycelial appressoria (Table 5). In addition, induction of mycelial appressorium, especially for cylindrical-spored species, often took more than 10 days (Cannon et al., 2008; Crouch et al., 2009b). It is therefore easier to characterize conidial appressoria and this has been suggested by Cai et al. (2009).   Pathogenicity analysis 
With the exception of the three new species, five other species identified in this study have been previously reported from several other hosts (Sutton, 1980; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Moriwaki et al., 2003; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009; Phoulivong et al., pers. comm.). We therefore selected the three new species for pathogenicity testing in vitro against 12 plants belonging to 6 families. The results showed that C. cliviae, C. hippeastri and 
C. hymenocallidis are not host-specific as they are able to infect two or three different hosts (Table 6). The virulence potential of Colletotri chum species has been shown to be dependent on interplay of various factors such as plant varieties, humidity, temperature and the concentration of inoculum (Simmonds, 1965; 
Freeman et al., 1998). The pathogenicity and virulence of these new species therefore needs testing in vivo.  144 Future study 
The Amaryllidaceae comprises 51 genera, with over 800 species and a worldwide distribution (Meerow et al., 1998, 2000). A high diversity of Colletotrichum species, including many undocumented new species, could be expected if more hosts are studied.  Acknowledgements
