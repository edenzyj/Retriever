Although C. acutatum was recently investigated and shown to be a species complex comprising about 30 species, the name is still used in its broad sense for anthracnose pathogens of fruits in Brazil. In this study, a multilocus molecular analysis was carried out based on a dataset of ITS, HIS3, GAPDH, CHS-1, TUB2 and ACT sequences of Colletotrichum strains belonging to the C. acutatum species complex from fruits collected in different regions in Brazil combined with sequences of ex-type and other reference strains of species belonging to this complex. The strains were revealed to belong to C. nymphaeae, C. melonis, C. abscissum and one new species, namely C. paranaense, from apple and peach. Morphological descriptions of the new species and a strain closely related to but diverging from C. melonis are provided. From the data presently available, the most common species on apple fruits in Brazil is C. nymphaeae. In a pathogenicity test, strains of all four species caused lesions on detached apple, peach and guava fruits, except for strain 
CBS 134730 that did not infect guava fruits.  MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT Research highlights  
A new species of the Colletotrichum acutatum complex was reported in this study 
Colletotrichum nymphaeae was the most common species associated with apple fruit in Brazil 
Different Colletotrichum species are associated with fruits in Brazil   
Keywords: Identification; multilocus phylogeny; pathogenicity; Plant pathogenic fungus; systematics;   1. Introduction  
Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, especially in tropical, subtropical and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts (Sutton 1992). The most common symptoms associated with Colletotrichum infections are sunken necrotic lesions, on which often orange conidial masses are produced, and that are referred to as anthracnose (Freeman et al. 1998). 
Colletotrichum species are considered as major pathogens associated with pre- and post-harvest fruit diseases, which cause yield losses mainly in tropical and subtropical areas (Baylei et al. 1992; Hyde et al. 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). 
Bitter rot, for example, is considered as one of the most important diseases of apple fruit that can cause up to 50 % yield loss (Sutton 1990).  
In the pre-molecular era, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species was predominantly based on morphological and cultural characters such as size and shape of conidia and appressoria, presence or absence of setae, colony colour and growth rate (von Arx 1957; Sutton 1980, 1992). However, these characters are not always reliable for species differentiation due to their variability under changing environmental conditions (Cai et al. 2009).  
To date much attention has also been given to conidium morphology (shape and dimensions). For instance, the acute conidial ends resulting in the typical fusiform shape are supposed to be one of the most important morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum was applied to many species with more or less fusiform conidia, most of them being MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT closely related to C. acutatum s. str., and conidial shape can show significant variation within the species and even among the strains of the same species (Damm et al. 2012). Several studies have demonstrated that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For example, 
Talhinhas et al. (2002) observed that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (= 
C. lupini) form different proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, corresponding with rather cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent study, many strains that were previously identified as C. gloeosporioides based on the more or less cylindrical conidia that are typical for the species (Cannon et al. 2008), were revealed to belong to different species of the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Furthermore, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, for example, C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013). 
Colletotrichum acutatum is known to be genetically highly variable and was divided in infraspecific groups on the basis of molecular data (Guerber et al. 2003; 
Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas 2005). Later it was suggested to be a species complex and separate species were accepted, for example C. clavatum, C. fioriniae and C. phormii (Farr et al. 2006; Shivas & Tan 2009; Faedda et al. 2011). Only recently, the C. acutatum species complex was revised applying a multilocus molecular approach on a large number of strains from numerous hosts worldwide, recognising 31 species (Damm et al. 2012). 
Bitter rot of apple is a serious disease of this crop caused by numerous species within the C. acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum fioriniae seems to be the species within the C. acutatum complex most frequently associated with apples in the USA, while strains from New Zealand belong to C. acerbum, C. fioriniae, C. pyricola and C. salicis (Guerber et al. 2003; Damm et al. 2012). Most of the Colletotrichum strains from apple causing bitter rot in Croatia were identified as 
C. fioriniae and some as C. clavatum (synonym of C. godetiae) based on ITS sequences (Ivic et al. 2012). A first report of apple bitter rot in the United Kingdom has been also associated with C. godetiae (Baroncelli et al. 2014). A further strain MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT had the same ITS sequence as strains BBA 65797 and IMI 345581, the latter previously identified as C. salicis by Damm et al. (2012). However, related species may have the same ITS sequence, as this locus is not always informative at the species level in the C. acutatum species complex. Other strains from apples in 
Europe included in the study of Damm et al. (2012) also belong to C. fioriniae and 
C. godetiae. In contrast, strains from apple in Japan identified by Sato and Moriwaki (2013) based on a multilocus analysis belong to C. nymphaeae and C. godetiae. 
Strains from bitter rot of apple in Korea in the study of Lee et al. (2007) probably belong to C. fioriniae and a species of C. acutatum clade 2 (C. nymphaeae and related species) according to Damm et al. (2012). However, previously isolated strains from apple and other fruits from Brazil belonging to the C. acutatum species complex were only identified as C. acutatum s. lat. (González et al. 2006; Giaretta et al. 2010). If sequences of these strains were generated at all, only ITS sequences are available on GenBank that do not allow accurate species identification within this complex. Therefore, the name C. acutatum is still used in its broad sense in Brazil (Serra et al. 2011; De Souza et al. 2013; Barquero Quirós et al. 2013; Ciampi-Guillardi et al. 2014). To date, only few studied species within the 
C. acutatum species complex occurring in Brazil have been identified, including a disease report of C. nymphaeae causing apple bitter rot in southern Brazil (Velho et al. 2014). The aim of the present study, therefore, was to identify Colletotrichum strains belonging to the C. acutatum species complex associated with different fruit crops from different localities in Brazil by means of multilocus molecular as well as morphological data, and to describe the new species encountered.   2. Material and Methods  2.1. Isolates  
A total of 17 Colletotrichum strains isolated from anthracnose symptoms on apple, peach and guava fruits from different localities in Brazil and tentatively identified as MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 
C. acutatum s. lat. based on conidial morphology was included in this study (Table 1). Type material of new species recognised in this study was deposited in the fungarium of the CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre (CBS), Utrecht, The 
Netherlands. Subcultures of the ex-type and other isolates used for morphological and sequence analyses are maintained in the culture collections of the CBS and 
CPC (personal collection of Pedro Crous), Utrecht, The Netherlands and in the 
Colletotrichum collection of the Mycology laboratory, Escola Superior de Agricultura “Luiz de Queiroz”, in Piracicaba, Brazil.   2.2. Phylogenetic analyses  
Genomic DNA used in this study was extracted according to Murray and Thompson (1980). The PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 12.5 µL using a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, MA, USA). The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), an intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and partial sequences of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2) and histone 3 (HIS3) genes were amplified and sequenced using the primers ITS-1F (Gardes & Bruns 1993) and ITS-4 (White et al. 1990), GDF1 and GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003), 
CHS-354R and CHS-79F (Carbone & Kohn 1999), ACT-512F and ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), BT2Fd (Woudenberg et al. 2009) and Bt-2b (Glass & 
Donaldson 1995) and CYLH3F and CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b), respectively. The conditions for PCR of ITS were the same as described by Woudenberg et al. (2009), while those for the other genes were carried out with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 min followed by 40 cycles of 30  s at 94 °C, 30 s at 52 °C and 30 s at 72 °C, and a final step at 72 °C for 7 min. The amplicons were visualized in 1 % agarose gels stained with GelRed™ (Biotium, USA). The sequencing was performed using the BigDye terminator sequencing kit v.3.1 (Applied Biosystems, 
USA) and an ABI PRISM® 3100 DNA sequencer (Applied Biosystems). 
The forward and reverse sequences generated were assembled using the software SeqMan v.9.0.4 (DNASTAR®, Madison/USA). Sequences of 59 ex-type MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT and other reference strains of species belonging to the C. acutatum complex as well as C. orchidophilum CBS 632.80 (as outgroup), all available on GenBank, were added to the dataset and the sequences aligned with MAFFT v.6.7 (Katoh & Toh 2008). The multiple sequence alignment was manually edited with MEGA v.5.2 (Tamura et al. 2011).  
Evolution models were estimated in MrModeltest v.3.7 (Huelsenbeck and 
Ronquist 2001; Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each locus. A Bayesian inference was used to reconstruct the phylogeny based on the multilocus alignment (ITS, HIS3, GAPDH, CHS-1, TUB2 and ACT). The partitioned analysis was performed twice in MrBayers v.3.2 (Ronquist et al. 2003) using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian posterior probabilities (BPP). Four 
MCMC chains were run simultaneously for random trees for 1 × 107 generations. 
Samples were taken every 1000 generations. The first 25 % of trees were discarded as burn-in phase of each analysis and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. 
Sequences derived in this study were lodged in GenBank (www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/genbank), the alignment in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org/treebase-web/home.html), and taxonomic novelties in 
MycoBank (www.mycobank.org, Crous et al. 2004a).  2.3. Morphological analysis  
Strains were cultivated on synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; 
Nirenberg 1976) with autoclaved filter paper and Anthriscus sylvestris stems placed on the surface and on oatmeal agar medium (OA; Crous et al. 2009). The cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with 12  h photoperiod for 10 d. 
Measurements of morphological characters were made according to Damm et al. (2007). Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid and 30 measurements per structure were made for each strain using a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope (DM) and a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope using MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. Appressoria were observed on the reverse side of the plates containing SNA medium. Unless mentioned otherwise, descriptions are based on the ex-type strains and only conidia from conidiomata were included in the morphological examination.   
Colony characteristics on SNA and OA medium were observed after the incubation period. To calculate the growth rates, the diameters of colonies were measured after 7 and 10 d. Colony colours were determined according to Rayner (1970).  2.4. Aggressiveness test   
To verify whether the species identified in this work are different in virulence or aggressiveness, a pathogenicity test was conducted by inoculating physiologically mature peach (Prunus persica cv. ‘Chimarrita’), apple (Malus domestica cv. ’Gala’) and guava (Psidium guajava cv. ‘Pedro Sato’) fruits. The maturation stage of the fruits was standardised on the basis of peel colour and pulp firmness using a colorimeter (Minolta, model CR-300, Japan) and a penetrometer (Tr Turoni, model 53200, Italy), respectively. Prior to the inoculation, the fruits were immersed in 0.5 % sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 min, then rinsed twice in sterile distilled water and air dried in the laminar flow cabinet. 
Strains CBS 134727, CPC 20897, CPC 134729, CPC 134730, CPC 134728 and Col 20 (Table 2) were grown on PDA for 7 d at 26 °C under near UV light (12 h photoperiod), to induce sporulation (Cai et al. 2009). After incubation, spores were harvested by adding 10 ml sterile distilled water to each culture followed by scraping the surface with a sterile brush. The resulting spore suspensions were filtered through sterile cheesecloth and the spore concentration was adjusted to 1x105 mL-1 using a haemocytometer. 
The fruits were placed in a plastic box with a lid containing water-soaked cotton wool and inoculated by wounding the fruits with a sterile needle and placing 40 µL spore suspension on the wound. Control fruits were inoculated with sterile distilled water. The plastic boxes were kept in an incubation room at 25 °C and 12 h MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT photoperiod. After 48 h, the lid of the box was removed and the boxes remained in the room for another 5 d. At the 7th day the lesion size was measured and the fungus re-isolated from the margin of the lesion.  
The experimental design was randomised with 10 fruits (replicates). Lesion length data were subjected to analysis of variance with the statistical programme “R” v. 3.0.1 (R Core Team 2013) and the means of each treatment compared using 
Tukey’s test at 95 % of probability.   3. Results   3.1. Phylogenetic analysis 
The molecular analysis of 76 isolates of C. acutatum s. lat. and the outgroup (C. orchidophilum, strain CBS 632.80) was performed on a sequence alignment with 2222 characters, of which 1702 were conserved, 200 were parsimony-uniformative and 320 were parsimony-informative. The gene boundaries were: ITS: 1–549, HIS3: 550–936, GAPDH: 937–1203, CHS-1: 1204–1482, TUB2: 1483–1974, ACT: 1975–2222. Based on the AIC criteria, the following evolution models were selected for the partitioned Bayesian inference: GTR+G for ACT and 
GAPDH, HKY+G for TUB2, K80+I+G for CHS-1, GTR+I+G for HIS3 and GTR+I for ITS.  
The phylogeny with the Bayesian posterior probability values (Fig. 1) exhibits five main clades with > 30 clades, most of which representing previously defined species of the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). The majority of the strains from fruits in Brazil grouped in clade 2, with the ex-epitype strain of C. nymphaeae. 
The C. nymphaeae clade was well supported with a Bayesian posterior probability value (BPP) of 1.0. However, it showed high intraspecific variability. Within C. nymphaeae, one strain from guava (CPC 20893) and all strains from apple in Brazil including one from a previous study (IMI 370491, see Table 1), formed an intraspecific subclade (BPP value 0.99).

ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT melonis (CBS 159.84). However, within C. melonis, strains Col 20 and CBS 159.84 formed a sister clade (BPP of 1.0) to strain CBS 134730. Strain CBS 134729, also from apple in Brazil, grouped with a strain from Caryocar, also from Brazil, that was treated as Colletotrichum sp. in a previous study (Damm et al. 2012). A third strain, 
CBS 134728 from Prunus, also grouped (BPP of 0,97) with this clade, which was recognized as a new species named C. paranaense. Strain CBS 134727 from 
Psidium grouped with two isolates described in previous studies as the causal agents of postbloom fruit drop (PFD) of sweet orange in Florida, USA (Peres et al., 2008) and with a strain also from sweet orange but isolated in Brazil and recently described as C. abscissum (Crous et al. 2015).  3.2.

Based on the multilocus molecular analysis, the strains studied here belong to four species within the C. acutatum species complex, including one species that proved to be new to science and is described below. Additionally, descriptions are also provided of strain CBS 134730 treated as C. cf. melonis and the strain CBS 134727 recognized as the new species described by Pinho and Pereira (2015).  3.2.1.

Specimens examined: BRAZIL, Rio Grande do Sul, from fruit anthracnose of Malus domestica, S. Alves (living culture CBS 134730 = CPC 20912 = Col 31).   
Notes: Strain CBS 134730 showed differences in morphology with the original strain. Conidiophores from C. cf. melonis on SNA were unbranched, not degenerate and conidiogenous cells often constrict at the base and smaller, while these characters in C. melonis were branched, degenerating rapidly, branched and the constriction of the conidigenuos cells was not mentioned. Also, conidia from C. cf. melonis were frequently acute in both ends, rarely observed in C. melonis, showed smaller L/W ratio and bigger appressoria. 
Strain CBS 134730 formed a sister clade with strains Col 20 and CBS 159.84, the ex-holotype strain of C. melonis (Fig. 1). Although sequences of C. melonis strain

CBS 134730 (99 % identity), none of them were identical; they differ in 4 nucleotides (nt), 1 nt and 3 nt, respectively. The GAPDH and ITS sequences of strain CBS 134730 were identical with those of Colletotrichum strain CBS 129823 from Passiflora edulis (JQ948512 and JQ948182), while its CHS-1 sequence matched 100 % with JQ948841 from strain CBS 330.75 from Coffea arabica, the ex-holotype strain of C. costaricense (Damm et al. 2012). In spite of these sequence differences, we refrain from describing strain CBS 134730 as a new species here, because it is only known from a single strain; it is possible, therefore, that intermediate strains exist between Col 20 and CBS 134730, as both strains were isolated from apple in Brazil.  3.2.2.

Colletotrichum paranaense can be distinguished from other Colletotrichum species by its unique TUB2 and HIS3 sequences. The closest matches in blastn searches on GenBank with the TUB2, GAPDH and HIS3 sequences of strain CBS 134729 were sequences of Colletotrichum strain IMI 384185 from Caryocar brasiliense (100 %, JQ949842, JQ948521, JQ949182) that is included in this study and considered as C. paranaense as well. However, the TUB2 and HIS3 sequences also matched with C. abscissum (99 % identical, 4 nt differences, KP843135) and C. cuscutae (1 nt different, JQ949186). The GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 134729 was also identical with that of Colletotrichum strain CBS 129821 from Passiflora edulis (JQ948512). The CHS-1 sequence was the same as that of C. costaricense (CBS 330.75, JQ948841; CBS 211.78, JQ948842), a recently described species from 
Coffea in Costa Rica (Damm et al. 2012) and was 99 % identical with C. paranaense strain IMI 384185 (JQ948852, all from Damm et al. 2012 and included in this study). The ITS region show intraspecific differences as CBS 134728 has identical sequence to C. limetticola CBS 114.14 but the other two strains (CBS 134729 and IMI 384185) have unique sequence showing 2 different nucleotides compared to the dataset used in this study.   3.2.3.

The closest matches with the CHS-1 sequence were Colletotrichum strains CBS 129810 from Solanum betaceum (100 % identity,

Rubus glaucus in Colombia (JN715842, Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2015).  
Damm et al. (2012) described a species from guava in India, C. guajavae that belongs to a different clade within the C. acutatum species complex than C. abscissum (Fig. 1). In addition, the morphology showed differences as well. Setae were observed in C. guajavae, while this character was not observed in C. abscissum. Peres et al. (2002) isolated a C. acutatum (s. lat.) strain from guava in 
Brazil with the same ITS sequence as C. guajavae (Damm et al. 2012). Another 
Colletotrichum species on guava, C. psidii, was described in Italy and belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012).   3.3. Aggressiveness test  
All tested strains were able to infect their original host and all other hosts included, except for C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730 that did not infect guava fruits (Table 2), while no lesions were formed on control fruits. However, there were differences in the size of the lesions and the frequency of fruits infected. None of the strains formed larger lesions on its original host compared to the other hosts.  
All strains tested formed large lesions on all inoculated peach fruits; while their infection frequency and lesion size on guava and apple were variable. MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT 
Colletotrichum melonis (Col 20), caused larger lesions on peach than C. paranaense (CBS 134728), C. abscissum (CBS 134727) and C. nymphaeae (CPC 20897). Colletotrichum abscissum showed no difference in lesion size between peach and guava. That strain infected only one apple; the lesions size of which was smaller then those caused by most other strains tested. Colletotrichum melonis strain Col 20 infected all inoculated guava fruits, while C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, infected only peach and apple. Additionally, C. nymphaeae strain CPC 20897 formed smaller lesions on guava fruits than C. paranaense strain CBS 134728.   4. Discussion 
A large number of Colletotrichum species belonging to the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes were recently differentiated, some of them being associated with fruit diseases of apple, including bitter rot (Damm et al. 2012; 
Weir et al. 2012). In most of the previous studies on apples in Brazil, the causal agents of bitter rot were reported as C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum (or its sexual morph Glomerella acutata), referring to these species in their wide sense as species complexes (Serra et al. 2011; De Souza et al. 2013; Barquero Quirós et al. 2013; Ciampi-Guillardi et al. 2014). Some of these studies have shown a high genetic variability among strains causing apple bitter rot in Brazil (González et al. 2006; Giaretta et al. 2010). Based on ITS sequences, Giaretta et al. (2010) differentiated strains from bitter rot of apple in five main clades, indicating the disease to be caused by several species within the C. acutatum and C. gloesporioides complexes. Our study on C. acutatum s. lat. strains from fruits in 
Brazil confirms at least three species of this complex to be associated with apple fruit diseases. 
In the study of Damm et al. (2012), most of the C. acutatum s. lat. strains from apple (mainly originating from the USA) were identified as C. fioriniae and a few strains each as C. acerbum, C. godetiae, C. salicis and C. nymphaeae, while the latter seems to be more important on other hosts, especially strawberry. The only C. nymphaeae strain from apple included in Damm et al. (2012) was also the only MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT strain from apple in South America in their study and originated from Brazil. Velho et al. (2014) tested strains of this species collected in southern Brazil to cause apple bitter rot. Our study suggests C. nymphaeae to be the most important species of the 
C. acutatum complex associated with anthracnose diseases of apple in Brazil. 
Based on ITS sequences, more than half of the C. acutatum strains from apple in 
Brazil in the study of Giaretta et al. (2010) and strains from a disease report of bitter rot of apple in Uruguay by Alaniz et al. (2012) belong to the same main clade within this species complex (indicated as main clade 2 in Damm et al. 2012) and might represent C. nymphaeae as well.  
The C. nymphaeae strains from Brazil included in this study formed a subclade within C. nymphaeae that slightly separates them from C. nymphaeae strains from other host plants (Fig. 1). Furthermore, sequences of strains in this study formed additional subclades, showing the genetic diversity within the species. 
Colletotrichum nymphaeae has a wide distribution and host range and has been shown to be genetically variable before, with strains from specific hosts forming intraspecific subclades (Damm et al. 2012). However, based on the low support of these subclades and few base pair differences, we refrain from describing further species within C. nymphaeae.  
While the majority of the strains was identified as C. nymphaeae, all other strains, including the newly described species C. paranaense and C. melonis are part of a main clade within the C. acutatum species complex (indicated as main clade 1 in 
Damm et al. 2012) that comprises closely related species predominantly occurring on various hosts in Central and South America which are well distinguished with 
GAPDH and TUB2 sequences. C. lupine, e.g., was originally described (as 
Gloeosporium lupini) on Lupinus albus in Brazil (Bondar 1912), but is a commonly occurring species worldwide (Nirenberg et al. 2002; Damm et al. 2012). Most likely, the speciation of C. lupini developed in South America as well and spread with the host plant to other parts of the world. Some of the strains from apple in this study were identified as C. melonis and a new species, C. paranaense. ITS sequences place the remaining strains occurring on apple in Brazil from the study of Giaretta et al. (2012) in the same main clade, although it is not possible to identify them to MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT species level on this basis. No species in this main clade of the C. acutatum species complex was previously associated with diseases of apple, peach or guava fruits, and none of the other four species of the C. acutatum complex from apple reported by Damm et al. (2012) from other regions in the world was so far found to be associated with apples in Brazil. These species (C. acerbum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae and C. salicis) were not reported from South America at all, except for a few C. godetiae strains from other hosts in Chile, Colombia and Mexico that formed an interspecific clade within C. godetiae. Thus, the species composition of the C. acutatum complex associated with apple bitter rot in Brazil (possibly in South 
America) is different from other regions in the world. This might be important for plant quarantine. 
Strain CBS 134727 of C. abscissum grouped together with strains of citrus postbloom fruit drop. This strain was collected on guava fruit with antracnose in a commercial orchard located at Cafelândia city. A previous study revealed that this strain is pathogenic to citrus, causing citrus postbloom fruit drop in 70 % of inoculated flowers (Ramiro et al., unpublished data). Guava volatiles are repellent to Diaphorina citri, the vector of citrus huanglongbing (HLB) (Zaka et al. 2010), and intercropping citrus with guava is considered a strategy to control HLB (Beattie el al., 2006). On the other hand, the fact that guava can host C. abscissum has obvious epidemiological consequences on citrus postbloom fruit drop outbreaks. 
All strains tested for their pathogenicity on fruits in this study were able to infect different fruit hosts. However they differed in their aggressiveness towards them. 
Several studies have demonstrated the lack of host specificity of Colletotrichum species infecting fruits (Peres et al. 2002; MacKenzie et al. 2009; Lakshmi et al. 2011; Phoulivong et al. 2012; de Souza et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2013; Baroncelli et al. 2015). Many Colletotrichum species can be associated with different hosts and one host can be affected by different species (Damm et al. 2012, 2014; Weir et al. 2012). In a study of MacKenzie et al. (2009), genetically distinct strains of C. acutatum (s. lat.) isolated from strawberry, blueberry, citrus and fern were pathogenic and shown to have differences in aggressiveness with the highest incidence and the biggest lesions being observed on their original host. Based on MANUSCRIP T  ACCEPTED 
ACCEPTED MANUSCRIPT their TUB2 sequences, Damm et al. (2012) could link the strains from strawberry to 
C. nymphaeae and the strains from blueberry to C. fioriniae. Some Colletotrichum species are more frequently associated with a specific fruit crop or seem to have a narrow host range, while other species occur on a wide range of hosts.  
Regarding the species isolated from apple, none of them seemed to be specific to apple fruits. Based on our pathogenicity data, they can all potentially infect peach and guava (with the exception of C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730 that did not infect guava at all), and there is no difference in virulence of the three species on apple. Colletotrichum nymphaeae was recently also identified among strains in the 
NIAS Genbank from multiple hosts, including several strains from apple and peach in Japan (Sato & Moriwaki 2013). This species caused lesions on fruits of all three hosts tested and apparently also occurs on all of them in nature. But although C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae both have a large host range, and some of the hosts are overlapping, there could be still differences in pathogenicity and aggressiveness as the results of MacKenzie et al. (2009) suggest.  
The species newly reported in this paper have so far only been isolated from apple, peach and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense). However, it was found to be potentially pathogenic also on guava in this study. Future studies will show if C. paranaense occurs on this host in nature. The knowledge of cross infection ability of a species is important to investigate its potential host range and, consequently, to support quarantine measures (Phoulivong et al.2012). The possible plurivorous nature of the species identified in this study might be one of the reasons for the cross-pathogenicity of the strains tested. Another reason could be the inoculation technique and incubation conditions of the pathogenicity test that might establish conditions more favourable for infection than usually occurring in nature. Although wound infection is common practice in pathogenicity tests on fruits (Cai et al. 2009; 
Peng et al. 2013), it could have influenced the virulence of the strains. For example, in inoculation experiments by von Arx and van der Velden (1961), the number of fruit hosts infected by C. orbiculare and "Glomerella cingulata" (probably C. gloeosporioides s. lat.) was much higher after wound inoculation than without wounding.

The Bayesian tree obtained in this study suggests high genetic variability among the species occurring in Brazil. This can be important knowledge for developing control strategies. For example, the population of a plant pathogen with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information can be used for predicting how long a control measure is likely to be effective (McDermott & McDonald 1993). 
Additionally, the correct identification of the pathogen is important for its effective control strategy based on fungicides, because some species are more sensitive to specific groups of chemical compounds than other species (Freeman et al. 1998; 
Wong & Midland 2007; Sanders et al. 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al. 1998). However, the individual species within these species complexes need to be tested for their sensitivity for specific fungicides. Furthermore, the accurate identification of the pathogens can improve our understanding of their epidemiology and infection strategy, and provide important knowledge for breeding of resistant cultivars.  5.
