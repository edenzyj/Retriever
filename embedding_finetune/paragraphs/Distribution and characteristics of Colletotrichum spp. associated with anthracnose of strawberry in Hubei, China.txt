Han, Y. C., Zeng, X. G., Xiang, F. Y., Ren, L., Chen, F. Y., and Gu, Y. C. 2016. Distribution and characteristics of Colletotrichum spp. associated with anthracnose of strawberry in Hubei, China. Plant Dis. 100:996-1006.
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious disease of straw berry. The etiology of anthracnose of strawberry is complex, and several
Colletotrichum spp. have been regarded as causal agents. In the present study, multilocus (actin, b-tubulin, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3 phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) phylogenetic analysis revealed that 100 isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of strawberry in central China belong to five species. In total, 97 isolates were identified belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, with C. murrayae, C. gloeosporioides, C. fructicola, and
C. aenigma accounting for 81, 8, 4, and 4% of the total isolates, respec tively. Three isolates belonging to the C. acutatum complex were identi fied as C. nymphaeae. On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of
C. fructicola and C. murrayae species showed strong pathogenicity to both leaves and petioles of strawberry, with plant mortality 30 days after inoculation of 77.8 and 55.6%, respectively.C. gloeosporioides,C. aenigma, and C. nymphaeae showed strong pathogenicity to leaves but weak path ogenicity to petioles, with plant mortality 30 days after inoculation of 5.6, 16.7, and 11.1%, respectively. The five species were divided into four classes based on their maximum growth temperatures. Isolates ofC. mur rayae and C. gloeosporioides were more tolerant to high temperature (>34°C) than isolates of other species, followed by C. fructicola and
C. aenigma. Isolates ofC. nymphaeae, which are only distributed in areas of higher altitude (1,100 m), were highly sensitive to higher temperature.
These results indicate that pathogenicity and adaptation to temperature are important factors in the distribution of Colletotrichum spp. on straw berry plants. This research may increase our understanding of how Colle totrichum spp. emerge and spread to geographical regions with different latitudes or elevations.
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is a small fruit crop of global importance. The area used for strawberry cultivation in China has in creased rapidly in recent years. Anthracnose can cause considerable yield losses under appropriate environmental conditions (Henz et al.
1992). Strawberry infected with Colletotrichum spp. may develop le sions on the petiole and crown, in serious cases resulting in the collapse and death of the plant. In nurseries, lesions form on stolons, resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms are later manifested as irregular and black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992). Three species have been reported as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeospor ioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003).
Anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. affects a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus was recently denoted the world’s eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi, based on perceived scientific and eco nomic importance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has long been problematic. Single-gene phy logenetic analyses have not been successful in delineating species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) noted the need to resurvey plant pathogens such as Colletotrichum spp. using molecular ap proaches because previous data based on morphology and internal transcribed spacer sequences are likely incorrect. Understanding of
Colletotrichum spp. has been significantly improved with the use of multilocus phylogenetic analysis on species complexes, as well as the epitypification of many important pathogenic species (Cai et al. 2009; Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a; Doyle et al.
2013; Su et al. 2011; Weir et al. 2012). An important contribution to the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complex was made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a).
Hyde et al. (2014) reviewed the species identification of members of Colletotrichum and revealed that the C. gloeosporioides complex consisted of 34 taxa. The C. acutatum complex currently comprises at least 31 taxa (Damm et al. 2012a).
Hitherto, little was known about the species and distribution of 
Colletotrichum associated with strawberry anthracnose in China. The first objective of this study was to identify and characterize the species associated with strawberry anthracnose in central China based on morphological, molecular, and pathogenic characteristics.
The second objective was to analyze the distribution of Colletotri chum spp. based on a large number of isolates.Material and Methods
Fungal isolate collections. Hubei Province is in the central region of the Yangtze River and has a warm, humid, subtropical climate (Zhang et al. 2009). From 2012 to 2014, plants exhibiting stunting, chlorosis, and root necrosis were collected from nurseries and pro duction fields in central China. Thirteen locations were sampled from different geographical regions in central China. The altitudes of the sampling locations were determined by GPS positioning using an
HTC desire 816D (HTC Co., Ltd., Shanghai, China). Most areas of
Hubei Province are plains area with an elevation of no more than 100 m. The 10-day average temperatures from 2012 to 2013 in
Wuhan and Lichuan were supplied by the meteorological service center of Hubei Province, China. The 10-day average temperature inWuhan (with an elevation of less than 100m) from July to Septem ber was 20.7 to 32.4°C in2012 and 2013 (Fig. 1). Enshi is a moun tainous area to the west of Hubei Province; the elevation of the sampling location in Enshi was approximately 1,100 m. The 10-day average temperature from July to September in Lichuan

Fungi were isolated from diseased tissues such as petioles, stolons, leaf lesions, or diseased crowns of infected strawberry plants. The dis eased plant tissues were surface disinfected in 70% ethanol for 10 s and 1% NaClO3 for 3 min, then rinsed three times with sterile distilled wa ter and, finally, dried with sterilized tissue paper. The samples were cut into 5-by-5-mm pieces and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) acidified with lactic acid at a final concentration of 0.05% to inhibit bacterial growth. The isolation plates were incubated under continuous fluorescent light in an incubator at 28°C for 3 to 7 days. The growing edges of any fungal hyphae developing on the PDA plates were then transferred aseptically to new PDA plates. The initial identification was based on the colonymorphology onPDAplates. Single-spore sub cultures were obtained forColletotrichum isolates, and isolates without conidia on the PDA plates were purified by transferring samples from the edge of each colony to new PDA plates three to five times. In total, 100 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from typical anthracnose lesions from strawberry petioles, stolons, and leaves. Of these, 98 iso lates were from Hubei Province and 2 isolates (Nj-2 and Nj-122) were obtained from Jiangsu Province in October. All isolates were stored at 10°C for about 1 to 2 weeks before DNA extraction.
Extraction of fungal DNA. To obtain mycelia from Colletotri chum spp., a 5-mm-diameter plug from the growing margin of a 5-day-old colony was inoculated on the center of an autoclaved cel lophane membrane placed on PDA (pH 7.0) in a petri dish (90 mm in diameter) (Lou et al. 2015). The dish was incubated at 28°C for 4 days. The mycelia of each isolate in the dish were collected using an autoclaved spatula and stored at −20°C until use. The mycelia of each isolate were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted and puri fied as described elsewhere (Lee and Taylor 1990). DNA samples from each isolate were stored at −20°C until use.
Polymerase chain reaction and DNA sequencing. Partial se quences corresponding to actin (ACT), b-tubulin (TUB2), calmodu lin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) were amplified from gDNA from the in dicated Colletotrichum isolates (Table 1) by polymerase chain reac tion (PCR). ACT and TUB2 were amplified using the primer pairs
ACT512F and ACT-R2, and T1 and Tub2-R2, respectively. CAL,
GPDH, and CHS-1 were amplified using the primer pairs CL1C and CL2C, GDF2 and GDR3, and CHS-88F and CHS-834R, respectively (Table 1). Primers of Act-R2, TUB-R2, GDR3, and
CHS-834Rwere designed downstream of the binding site of standard primers (Weir et al. 2012) at these loci. All new primers designed in this study from the conserved domain in the corresponding genes in
C. crassipes, C. graminicola, and C. gloeosporioides provided more specific amplification for species in this study (data not presented).
The primers were used for PCR and PCR product sequencing unidi rectionally, because this was more convenient than sequencing from both ends.
The PCR amplification mixtures were set up in a 0.25-ml tube con taining 60ml of reactionmixture comprising 1ml of each primer solution (50 mM), 2 ml of dNTP mix solution (2.5 mM), 1 ml of gDNA solution (approximately 50 ng per reaction mixture), 1 ml of Taq DNA polymer ase (5 U per reaction mixture; TAKARA Biotechnology Co., Ltd.,
Dalian, China), 6 ml of PCR buffer, and 49 ml of PCR-grade water.
PCRwas performed in a thermal cycler (PTC-100TMPeltier Ther mal Cycler; Hercules, CA). The cycling parameters for GPDH con sisted of a denaturation step at 94°C for 5 min; followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 65°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final cycle at 72°C for 10 min. The cycling parameters for CAL were 94°C for 5 min; followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 2 min; and a final step at 72°C for 10 min. The cycling parameters for the ACT, TUB2, and CHS-1 regions consisted of a 5-min denaturing step at 94°C; followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 59°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min; and a final cycle of 10 min at 72°C. A 5-ml aliquot of each PCRwas separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel in 1.0× Tris-acetate EDTA buffer and photo graphed under UV light after staining with Gel Red for 30 min.
PCR products containing the target band were purified using the
AxyPrep PCR Cleanup Kit (Axygen Biological Technology Co.,
Ltd., Hangzhou, Zhejiang Province, China) according to the manu facturer’s instructions, then individually sequenced on an ABI
PRISM 377-96 automatic sequencer (Beijing AuGCT Biotechnol. Co., Ltd., Beijing) via the dideoxynucleotide termination method us ing a Big Dye Terminator v2.0 Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems
Inc., Foster City, CA). All sequences were divided into 25 groups by genes and species (based on the result of preliminary phylogenetic analyses) and were aligned with DNAMAN (v. 7.0). Sequences with single-nucleotide polymorphisms were amplified and sequenced a total of three times to ensure that polymorphisms were not due to sequencing errors.

Plant Disease /May 2016 997 isolates of recognized species within the C. gloeosporioides complex (Hyde et al. 2014; Weir et al. 2012), and isolate CBS123755 of
C. boninense (Damm et al. 2012b), were used to establish a five-locus combined dataset (ACT + CAL + CHS-1 + GPDH + TUB2) in the first Bayesian inference (A) analysis. C. boninense (ICMP17958) was used as an outgroup. The sequence of CAL was missing for sev eral representative isolates within the C. acutatum species complex.
Therefore, partial DNA sequences of ACT, CHS-1, GADH, and
TUB2 for isolates Lch-5, Lch-9-1, and Lch-13 (Table 2) and for 31 representative isolates (Damm et al.2012a; Hyde et al. 2014) were used to establish a four-locus combined dataset (ACT + CHS-1 +
GPDH + TUB2) in the second Bayesian inference (B) analysis.
C. pseudoacutatum was used as an outgroup in this analysis.
Multiple sequence alignments of each gene were constructed using 
ClustalW as implemented in MEGA v.5 (Tamura et al. 2011). The sequences generated for the genes in this study were manually trun cated to align with the reference sequences of the type isolates for constructing phylogenetic trees. Bayesian inference was used to re construct the phylogenetic trees using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al. 2012). The best-fit models of nucleotide substitution for ACT

 998 Plant Disease /Vol. 100 No. 5 (K80+G), CAL (GTR+G), CHS-1 (K80+G), GPDH (HKY+I), and
TUB2 (GTR+I) were selected with MrModelTest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) using the Akaike Information Criteria. The multiple nucleotide sequence alignments of all genes were concatenated, and analysis was performed twice on the full data set for 5 × 107 generations. Sam ples were taken from the results every 1,000 generations. The conver gence of all parameters was verified using the Tracer program (Rambaut and Drummond 2007). The first 25% of generations were discarded as burn-in. The concatenated alignment and trees were sub mitted to TreeBASE (www.treebase.org) with a submission number of 16878.
Isolates for biological characteristics. Based on the result of phy logenetic analyses, 21 representative Colletotrichum isolates obtained from different locations were selected for further characterization of colony and mycelial growth at different temperatures. The selected isolates included five C. murrayae isolates (Yd-8, Ydu-15, Nj-2,
Nj-122, and MC-17-1), four C. fructicola isolates (Sab-4-3, Sha-4,
Lch-39-2, and Fch-3), five C. gloeosporioides isolates (Lch-1911,
Xya-221,Yd-2, Jsh-6-1, and Wha-4), four C. aenigma isolates (Wha-2, Lbwuh-4-2, Hzau-1, and Hzau-2-1), and three C. nymphaeae isolates (Lch-5, Lch-9-1, and Lch-13). Morphological and cultural characterization. Morphological and cultural characterizations were performed according to the meth ods described by Cai et al. (2009). Mycelial discs (5 mm in diameter) were taken from areas near the colony edge of 5-day-old cultures, transferred to PDA, and incubated at 28°C under mixed white and near-UV fluorescent light sources under a cycle of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with three replicates of each isolate. Colony color, conidial dimensions, and morphology were assessed (Cai et al.

Plant Disease /May 2016 999 http://www.treebase.org/ 2009; Peng et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). Conidial suspensions of each species were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses on
PDA. The shape and color of the conidia were observed, and the size of 50 conidia per isolate was measured using a microscope (BM2000;
Nanjing Jiangnan Novel Optics Co., Ltd., Nanjing, China). Effect of temperature onmycelial growth. In total, 21 isolates of the five species were evaluated to determine the effect of temperature on radial colony growth in culture. All isolates were maintained on
PDA supplemented with lactic acid at 28°C for 5 days. Plugs of agar with a diameter of 5 mm were cut from the leading edge of colonies and placed in the center of petri plates containing PDA. The plates were then wrapped with parafilm and placed in an incubator (BPH 9272; Shanghai Yiheng Scientific Instrument Co., Ltd., Shanghai,
China) at 1 of 11 temperatures (6, 10,14, 18, 22, 26, 28, 30, 32, 34, 36, 38, 40, and 42°C [±0.2°C]) in the dark. After 4 days, colony diameters were measured and used to calculate the mycelial growth rate (in millimeters per day). The experiment was designed as a ran domized complete block, with three replicates of each isolate for each temperature treatment. The experiment was repeated once.
Pathogenicity assays. Not all the Colletotrichum isolates could sporulate on PDA plus 0.2% yeast extract (PDAY); therefore, one isolate of each species that could sporulate on PDAY was selected

 1000 Plant Disease /Vol. 100 No. 5 for pathogenicity assays. C. murrayae isolate Nj-2, C. gloeospor ioides isolate Jsh-7-1, C. fructicola isolate Lch-39-2, C. aenigma iso late Lbwuh-4-2, and C. nymphaeae isolate Lch-5 were utilized for pathogenicity tests. The five isolates were maintained on PDA sup plemented with lactic acid at 28°C for 5 days. Plugs of agar with a diameter of 5 mm were cut from the leading edge of colonies and placed in the center of petri plates containing PDAY. The fungal iso lates were grown at 28°C under mixed white and near-UV fluorescent light sources under a cycle of 12 h of light and 12 h of darkness (de los
Santos Garcıá de Paredes and Romero Muñoz 2002), and sporulated profusely after 7 to 10 days. Plates were flooded with sterile distilled water, the spore suspension was passed through cheesecloth to remove dislodged mycelia (Mangandi et al. 2015), and the suspension was adjusted to 2 × 106 conidia/ml.
Healthy 6-week-old strawberry plants (‘Benihopp’) devoid of any exposure to fungicides were used for plant inoculation experiments.
Plants were inoculated by spraying conidial suspensions (2 × 106 conidia/ml) of the five isolates (Nj-2, Jsh-7-1, Lch-39-2, Lbwuh-4-2, and Lch-5) until runoff (Freeman and Katan 1997). Negative control plants received sterile water without conidia. Nine plants were inocu lated with each isolate separately and maintained in a moisture cham ber at 25 to 35°C for 48 h, then transferred to a greenhouse at 25 to 35°C for 30 days under natural daylight conditions.
The pathogenicity to strawberry of different species were evalu ated by calculating the disease index (DI) according to the symptoms severity (SS) of leaves and petioles, respectively. The SS class of leaves, which was calculated based on a percentage of infected leaf surface caused by Colletotrichum spp., was described on a six-point scale, as follows: 0 = healthy leaves with no lesions or 1 = 0.1 to 5.0, 3 = 5.1 to 15.0, 5 = 15.1 to 30.0, 7 = 30.1 to 50.0, and 9 = 50.1 to 100% infected leaf surface or dead leaves. The SS class of petioles, calculated based on the length of lesions caused by
Colletotrichum spp. on petioles, was described on a six-point scale, as follows: 0 = healthy petiole with no lesions or lesions of 1 = 0.1 to 2, 3 = 2.1 to 5.0, 5 = 5.1 to 9.0, 7 = 9.1 to 15.0, and 9 = >15.0 mm in length or leaves wilting) (Wang et al. 2008). All leaves and petioles on each plant were evaluated individually.
The number of leaves or petioles in each SS class was recorded 20 days after inoculation (dai) and plant mortality was recorded 30 dai. These experiments were conducted twice.
SS were converted to DI that was calculated using the formula of 
Horiuchi and Hori (1980): DI = [(n0 × 0 + n1 × 1 + n3 × 3 + n5 × 5 + n7 × 7 + n9 × 9)/9N] × 100, where n is the number of leaves or petioles in this SS class; the subscript numbers 0, 1, 3, 5, 7, and 9 are the SS class; and N is the total number of leaves or petioles.
Data analysis. Data from the pathogenicity test were subjected to analysis of variance using the Statistical Analysis Systems (SAS, ver sion 8.0; SAS Institute, Cary, NC) in order to determine the signifi cance of treatment differences. Means for different species from the pathogenicity test were separated using the least significance differ ence (LSD) test at P = 0.05 level. The minimum, optimum, and max imum growth temperature data were analyzed using the general linear model procedure (PROC GLM) in SAS. Species were consid ered fixed effects and isolates were considered random effects. When

Molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses. ACT, 
CAL, CHS-1, GPDH, and TUB2 regions of all isolates were success fully amplified and sequenced. Among the 100 isolates, 97 isolates were identified belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex and 3 isolates were identified belonging to the C. acutatum species complex.
The Bayesian inference (A) with the haplotypes belonging to the 
C. gloeosporioides species complex was performed with the com bined TUB2, ACT, CAL, GPDH, and CHS-1 sequences and com prised 2,352 characters after alignment. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: TUB2, 1 to 733; ACT, 734 to 1,028; CAL, 1,029 to 1,776; GPDH, 1,777 to 2,081; and CHS-1, 2,082 to 2,352. The Bayesian inference (B) with the haplotypes belonging to the C. acutatum species complex was performed with the combined TUB2, ACT, GPDH, and CHS-1 sequences and com prised 1,265 characters after alignment. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: TUB2, 1 to 495; ACT, 496 to 745; GPDH, 746 to 1,015; CHS-1, 1,016 to 1,265.
The isolates from strawberry belonged to five clades. In Bayesian inference (A), 81 isolates clustered with C. murrayae Li J. Peng &
K. D. Hyde; 8 isolates clustered with C. gloeosporioides (Penz.)
Penz. & Sacc., 4 isolates clustered with C. fructicola Prihastuti,
L. Cai & K. D. Hyde; and 4 isolates clustered with C. aenigma
B. S. Weir & P. R. Johnst. (Fig. 2). In Bayesian inference (B), three isolates clustered with C. nymphaeae (Pass.) Aa (Fig. 3). C. murrayae was the most frequently isolated species, comprising 81% of all isolates, followed by C. gloeosporioides at 7%. Isolates of
C. murrayae were widely distributed in Hubei Province. C. gloeosporioides was primarily distributed in Wuhan, Xiangyang,
Yichang, and Enshi. C. fructicola was mainly distributed in
Xiangyang, Jingzhou, and Enshi. All four isolates of C. aenigma were isolated from Wuhan. C. nymphaeae was distributed in Enshi (Fig. 4).The altitudes of the sampling locations were no higher than 100 m, with the exception of Enshi (with an altitude of 1,100 m).
Morphological and cultural characterization. Few differences of colonymorphologywere observed among the five species identified when grown on PDA. All selected isolates developed white colonies that became gray after 10 days. Isolates ofC. nymphaeae andC. gloeo sporioides produced numerous conidia on PDA, while isolates of the other three species produced fewer conidia (Fig. 5). The conidia pro duced by C. nymphaeae were sharp at both ends (Fig. 6). This mor phology was different from that of the other four species in this study (Table 3).
Effect of temperature on mycelial growth. The optimum tem perature of all five Colletotrichum spp. in the current study was 28°C but the tolerance to high temperature (34°C) among species was different (Fig. 7). The five species were divided into four groups based on their maximum growth temperatures (Table 4). Isolates of
C. nymphaeae, which were isolated only in Enshi, were sensitive to high temperatures. The average growth rates of the three isolates were 0.11 mm/day at 34°C, and no mycelial growth in vitro was ob served at temperatures above 34°C (Table 4).
Isolates of C. fructicola and C. aenigma were similar in their tol erances to high temperatures. These two species were moderately sensitive to high temperature and grew very slowly at 36°C, with col ony diameters smaller than those of isolates of C. murrayae and
C. gloeosporioides but larger than those of isolates of C. nymphaeae.
No mycelial growth in vitro of the C. fructicola and C. aenigma iso lates was observed at temperatures above 36°C (Fig. 7). Isolates of
C. gloeosporioides and C. murrayae were tolerant to high tempera tures, with a significantly larger colony diameter than the other four species when the ambient temperature was above 36°C. Mycelial growth in vitro was observed even at 40°C, with average growth rates of 0.11 and 0.08 mm/day, respectively (Fig. 7).
Pathogenicity assays. All isolates of Colletotrichum tested were pathogenic to nonwounded strawberry leaves and petioles. Symp toms first appeared on leaves. Infected leaves developed sunken, prominent, dark-brown to black decay, and necrotic lesions, and typ ical orange conidial masses were often observed on leaves 7 to 10 dai.
Symptoms of anthracnose were not observed on petioles at 10 dai. At 20 dai, symptoms appeared on both leaves and petioles of strawberry (Fig. 5). Disease severity caused by the five species showed signifi cant differences. Isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae species showed strong pathogenicity on both leaves and petioles of straw berry (Table 5). Plant mortalities caused by C. fructicola and 
Fig. 4. Distribution of Colletotrichum spp. associated with anthracnose of strawberry in Hubei Province, China. 1002 Plant Disease /Vol. 100 No. 5 
C. murrayae at 30 dai were 77.8 and 55.6% respectively (Table 5).
C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. nymphaeae showed strong pathogenicity to leaves but weak to petioles. Plant mortal ities caused by these species at 30 dai were 5.6, 16.7, and 11.1%, respectively (Table 5), as compared with 0% for the water control plants.Discussion
This study represents the first attempt to characterize Colletotri chum spp. associated with anthracnose of strawberry in China using a polyphasic approach. GPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and TUB2 loci were employed in the phylogenetic analysis. Phylogenetic analysis showed that the 100 Colletotrichum isolates from strawberry plants belonged to five species. This study provides the first report of
C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, C. murrayae, C. fructicola, and
C. nymphaeae from strawberry in China, while C. fructicola and
C. nymphaeae have been recorded from strawberry previously (Damm et al. 2012a; Weir et al. 2012). Together with the 9 species in the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes (Damm et al. 2012a; Weir et al. 2012), 12 Colletotrichum spp. are now known to be associated with strawberry hosts. C. gloeosporioides, which was previously recognized as a pathogen of strawberry, is actually a species complex. C. gloeosporioides was typified by Cannon et al. (2008) and a recent study indicated this species was associ ated with the genera Citrus, Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis (Weir et al. 2012). These results are in agreement with previous re ports that C. gloeosporioides species complex is the most preva lent agent of strawberry anthracnose in China, while C. acutatum species complex only occasionally causes anthracnose (Xie et al.
2010). C. theobromicola (synonymous with C. fragariae) has been reported to infect strawberry plants (Brooks 1931; Xie et al. 2010) but no isolates of this species were identified in this study.
Important progress on taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and 
C. acutatum species complex have been made by Weir et al.
(2012) and Damm et al. (2012a) but the biological characteristics such as temperature characteristics, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum spp. is unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002;
Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a major factor affecting epidemics of plant disease; it can affect spore germination and infection, latent period, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to many path ogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature highs and their frequency can be factors in the delay or absence of plant dis ease (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). On the other hand, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature is an important factor for disease emergence

Plant Disease /May 2016 1003 and spread. For example, Botrytis fruit rot of strawberry caused by
Botrytis cinerea occurs mainly at low temperatures in winter and spring (Elad et al. 2007); however, Colletotrichum spp. require rela tively hot temperatures and mainly cause anthracnose of strawberry in summer (Henz et al. 1992; Xie et al. 2010). The minimum, opti mum, and maximum growth temperatures are important biological characteristics and widely used to characterize microorganisms (Damm et al. 2012a,b; Prihastuti et al. 2009; Weir et al. 2012). In this study, no significant differences were observed in the minimum and optimum growth temperatures of the five Colletotrichum spp. but the maximum growth temperatures were different (Table 4). The five
Colletotrichum spp. were grouped into four classes based on their maximum growth temperatures.
C. murrayae was originally reported from Citrus leaves in China (Peng et al. 2012). C. murrayae is tolerant to high temperature and showed strong pathogenicity to strawberry plants. C. murrayae was the most frequently isolated species, distributed in nearly all sampling areas, and seems to be the most economically important species in strawberry nurseries in Hubei, China. C. gloeosporioides was tolerant to high temperature but was weakly pathogenic to straw berry plants. C. gloeosporioides was the second most prevalent spe cies, with 8% of all isolates (Fig. 4). C. fructicola was originally reported causing coffee berry disease in Thailand (Prihastuti et al.
2009). Although C. fructicola showed stronger pathogenicity to strawberry plants than other four species in this study, it showed less tolerance to high temperature than C. murrayae and C. gloeospor ioides, and occurred only sporadically.
C. aenigma was first described by Weir et al. (2012) and causes anthracnose of Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and Persea americana in Israel (Weir et al. 2012). C. nymphaeae was originally described in detail in morphological and pathological terms by van der Aa (1978). A description in morphological and multilocus phylogenetic analysis of this species was provided by Damm et al. (2012a).
C. aenigma and C. nymphaeae showed weak pathogenicity to strawberry plants and were less tolerant to high temperature than
C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides. C. aenigma and C. nymphaeae occurred very sporadically in Hubei, China (Fig. 4).
According to current data, the results revealed that each species possesses a stable and distinguishable maximum growth tempera ture, which may be used for distinguishing Colletotrichum spp., particularly morphologically similar species. The frequencies and distribution of these five species are related to differences in high temperature tolerance and pathogenicity. This research may in crease our understanding of how Colletotrichum spp. emerge and spread to geographical regions with different latitudes or ele vations. Due to climate change, pathogens are exposed to increas ingly warmer environments, and the impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to in crease with latitude and elevation (Colwell et al. 2008; Deutsch et al. 2008; Harvell et al. 2002). This research is also important for predicting changes that may occur due to global warming con ditions. Further studies should be conducted on the host range, distribution, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. at different temperatures.
