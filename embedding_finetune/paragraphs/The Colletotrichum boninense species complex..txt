Abstract: Although only recently described, Colletotrichum boninense is well established in literature as an anthracnose pathogen or endophyte of a diverse range of host plants worldwide. It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using 
ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognised here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii and 12 previously undescribed species, C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, 
C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are only known from New Zealand, perhaps reflecting a sampling bias. 
The new combination C. phyllanthi was made, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and the name replaced with C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are the conidiogenous cells with rather prominent periclinal thickening that also sometimes extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations as well as conidia that have a prominent basal scar. Many species in the C. boninense complex form teleomorphs in culture.

Colletotrichum boninense was first described from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum (Amaryllidaceae) collected in the Bonin Islands, Japan (Moriwaki et al. 2003). According to these authors, the species was associated with a variety of host plants in Japan, including Clivia miniata (Amaryllidaceae), Cucumis melo (Cucurbitaceae), Cattleya sp., Cymbidium sp. and Dendrobium kingianum (Orchidaceae), 
Passiflora edulis (Passifloraceae) and Prunus mume (Rosaceae). 
Since 2003, C. boninense (in its wide sense prior to our research) has frequently been identified as a pathogen causing fruit and leaf anthracnose, as well as an endophyte of a range of host plants worldwide, especially belonging to Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, 
Proteaceae and Solanaceae. For example, C. boninense was found to be associated with diseases of Leucospermum and 
Protea cynaroides in Australia and Zimbabwe and with Eucalyptus in South Africa (Lubbe et al. 2004). In pathogenicity studies it was shown to infect Protea leaves and stems (Lubbe et al. 2006). Farr et al. (2006) reported C. boninense on Dracaena and Pachira in China, Passiflora in New Zealand and Hippeastrum in Brazil and the Netherlands. According to Johnston & Jones (1997) and 
Johnston et al. (2005), C. boninense (= C. gloeosporioides groups 
E–I in Johnston & Jones 1997) occurs on a range of hosts including 
Capsicum, Citrus, Cucurbita and Solanum species in New Zealand. 
Colletotrichum boninense was reported as the cause of anthracnose of pepper (Capsicum annuum) in Brazil (Tozze et al. 2009), of passion fruit (Passiflora) in Florida (Tarnowski & Ploetz 2010) and Brazil (Tozze et al. 2010) and of Crinum asiaticum in China (Yang et al. 2009). Lee et al. (2005a, b) observed leaf anthracnose on Japanese spindle tree (Euonymus japonica) in Korea and demonstrated the pathogenicity of C. boninense. Nguyen et al. (2009) reported C. boninense as a pathogen of berries and twigs of 
Coffea in Vietnam. Recently, C. boninense was identified as one of the causal agents of anthracnose in avocado (Persea americana) in Mexico (Silva-Rojas & Ávila-Quezada 2011).
Lu et al. (2004) detected probable C. boninense isolates as endophytes in leaves of several tree species in the Iwokrama Forest 
Reserve in Guyana. Other reports of C. boninense as endophytes include Pileggi et al. (2009), who isolated it from leaves of the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia in Brazil. Joshee et al. (2009) studied foliar endophytes of Podocarpaceae and Myrtaceae trees in New Zealand and identified several of them as belonging to the 
C. boninense group. Several other isolates causing anthracnose on tamarillo, Passiflora and mango from Colombia (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003) and endophytes in coffee plants from Colombia and 
Hawaii (Vega et al. 2010) belonging to the C. boninense species StudieS in Mycology 73: 1–36.

 complex were detected in blastn searches in GenBank. Yang et al. (2011) recently reported C. boninense from Pleione bulbocodioides and Oncidium flexuosum (Orchidaceae) in China and described a related species, C. karstii that occurs on several orchids in China. 
Conidia of C. boninense s. lat. are similar to those of C. gloeosporioides, differing only slightly in length/width ratio and in the presence of a prominent scar at the base of the conidium (Moriwaki et al. 2003). Isolates of C. boninense have often been identified as C. gloeosporioides in the past (Moriwaki et al. 2002, 2003, Johnston et al. 2005). Von Arx (1957) listed approximately 600 synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and nine formae speciales, and it is likely that some of these refer to C. boninense.
The ITS1 phylogeny in the paper of Moriwaki et al. (2003) shows considerable infraspecific variation. Some of the strains accepted by these authors as C. boninense are referable to the segregate species recognised in this paper. Lubbe et al. (2004) recognised two subgroups but considered both as C. boninense. Grouping within C. boninense was also detected by phylogenies of strains from New Zealand (Johnston & Jones 1997, Johnston et al. 2005) showing several clades, with some developing sexual morphs (see 
Hyde et al. 2009). These data indicate that C. boninense represents a species complex. In this paper, we characterise species within the C. boninense species complex morphologically and by means of multi-gene analysis.MATERIALS AND METHODS Isolates 
Isolates comprised those previously identified as C. boninense as well as other related cultures from the CBS culture collection. 
The type specimens of the species studied are located in the fungaria (dried fungus collections) of the Centraalbureau voor 
Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands, the Botanische 
Staatssammlung München (M), Germany and the Royal Botanic 
Gardens, Kew (K(M)), United Kingdom which now incorporates the CABI dried collection (IMI). The culture dried down to serve as epitype specimen of C. petchii, was selected from the culture collection of the CBS. All descriptions are based on either the ex holotype or ex-epitype culture. Features of other isolates are added if they deviated from the ex-holotype and ex-epitype isolates. 
Subcultures of the types and epitypes, as well as all other isolates used for morphological and sequence analyses, are maintained in the culture collections of CBS, IMI and/or ICMP (International 
Collection of Microorganisms from Plants, Landcare Research, 
Auckland, New Zealand), and their data are presented in Table 1.Morphological analysis 
To enhance sporulation, 5-mm-diam plugs from the margin of actively growing cultures were transfered to the centre of 9-cm diam Petri dishes containing synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976) amended with autoclaved filter paper and double-autoclaved stems of Anthriscus sylvestris placed onto the agar surface. The strains were also studied after growth on OA (oatmeal agar, Crous et al. 2009) or 2 % PDA (Difco potato-dextrose agar). Cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12 h photoperiod for 10 d. Measurements and photographs of characteristic structures were made according to methods described by Damm et al. (2007). Appressoria on hyphae were observed on the reverse side of colonies grown on SNA plates. 
Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure, and observed with a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope (DM) or with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. Colony characters and pigment production on SNA and OA incubated at 20 °C were noted after 10 d. Colony colours were rated according to Rayner (1970). Growth rates were measured after 7 and 10 d. Phylogenetic analysis 
Genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted using the method of 
Damm et al. (2008). The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), beta tubulin (TUB2), histone3 (HIS3) and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified and sequenced using the primer pairs ITS-1F (Gardes & 
Bruns 1993) + ITS-4 (White et al. 1990) or V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) + ITS-4, GDF1 + GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003), 
ACT-512F + ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), CHS-354R + 
CHS-79F (Carbone & Kohn 1999), BT2Fd + BT4R (Woudenberg et al. 2009) or T1 (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997) + Bt-2b (Glass & 
Donaldson 1995), CYLH3F + CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b) and 
CAL 228F + CAL 737R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), respectively. 
The PCRs were performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied 
Biosystems, Foster City, California) in a total volume of 12.5 μL. 
The GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1, TUB2, HIS3 and CAL PCR mixture contained 1 μL 20x diluted genomic DNA, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1x PCR buffer (Bioline, Luckenwalde, Germany), 2 mM MgCl2, 20 μM of each dNTP, 0.7 μL DMSO and 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline). Conditions for amplification were an initial denaturation step of 5 min at 94 oC, followed by 40 cycles of 30 s at 94 oC, 30 s at 52 oC and 30 s at 72 oC, and a final denaturation step of 7 min at 72 oC. The ITS PCR was performed as described by Woudenberg et al. (2009). The DNA sequences obtained from forward and reverse primers were used to obtain consensus sequences using 
Bionumerics v. 4.60 (Applied Maths, St-Martens-Latem, Belgium), which were added to the outgroup (C. gloeosporioides CBS 112999) and the alignment assembled and manually adjusted using Sequence Alignment Editor v. 2.0a11 (Rambaut 2002). 
To determine whether the seven sequence datasets were congruent and combinable, tree topologies of 70 % reciprocal 
Neighbour-Joining bootstrap with Maximum Likelihood distances (10000 replicates) with substitution models determined separately for each partition using MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) were compared visually (Mason-Gamer & Kellogg 1996). A maximum parsimony analysis was performed on the multilocus alignment (ITS, 
ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) with PAUP (Phylogenetic 
Analysis Using Parsimony) v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2000) using the heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing and all characters were unordered and of equal weight. The robustness of the trees obtained was evaluated by 500 bootstrap replications with two random sequence additions (Hillis & Bull 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC) and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting tree. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) for the Damm et al.
 6 combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3 were included for each gene partition. The analyses of two MCMC chains were run from random trees for one million generations and sampled every 100 generations. The likelihood score of the two runs were 2 730 and 2 170 and therefore, the first 2 450 (the average of both) trees were discarded as the burn-in phase of the analysis and posterior probabilities determined from the remaining trees. Sequences derived in this study were lodged at GenBank, the alignment in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org), and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004a).RESULTS Phylogeny 
The seven sequence datasets did not show any conflicts in tree topology for the 70 % reciprocal bootstrap trees, which allowed us to combine them. In the multigene analyses (gene boundaries of 
ITS: 1–561, GAPDH: 572–864, CHS-1: 875–1154, HIS3: 1164– 1562, ACT: 1573–1851, TUB2: 1862–2363, CAL: 2374–2823) of 87 isolates of C. boninense and related Colletotrichum species including the outgroup, 2 823 characters including the alignment gaps were processed, of which 572 characters were parsimony informative, 247 parsimony-uninformative and 2004 constant. After a heuristic search using PAUP, 958 most parsimonious trees were retained (length = 1423 steps, CI = 0.740, RI = 0.927, RC = 0.686, 
HI = 0.260) of which one is shown in Fig. 1. The topology of the 958 trees was similar, which was verified for a large selection of trees. 
They differed in the position of taxa within the subclades and in the position of strain CBS 130241. For Bayesian analysis, a HKY+G model was selected for ACT and CAL, SYM+I+G for ITS, K80+I+G for CHS-1, GTR+I+G for HIS3, and HKY+I for GAPDH and TUB2, and incorporated in the analysis. The consensus tree obtained from Bayesian analyses confirmed the tree topology obtained with parsimony as well as the bootstrap support (Fig. 1).
The analyses resulted in the detection of 18 clades, which we accept as representing different Colletotrichum species. 
More than half of all strains included cluster in the first clade (C. karstii) with a bootstrap support of 96 % and a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. Two single strain clades, representing 
C. phyllanthi and C. annellatum, group with this big clade with a bootstrap support/Bayesian posterior probability value of 96/0.99 and 100/1.00, respectively. The C. petchii clade is well supported (100/1.00) and forms a sister clade to the first three species. The clade representing C. novae-zelandiae consists of two strains on a long branch (100/1.00). In contrast, the following five clades are short-branched, namely C. boninense s. str. (95/1.00), C. torulosum (100/1.00), C. cymbidiicola (96/1.00), C. oncidii (100/1.00) and a clade containing an unnamed single strain (CBS 123921). These five species form a sister clade (100/1.00) to another well supported (100/1.00) clade formed by two single strain clades, C. beeveri and C. brassicicola, and the C. colombiense clade (100/1.00) containing two strains. The clades representing C. hippeastri and 
C. brasiliense consist of three and two strains respectively, and are well supported (100/1.00). They group (100/1.00) with a single strain clade (C. parsonsiae). The C. constrictum clade (100/1.00) containing two strains and the single strain clade representing C. dacrycarpi are on very long branches and group with a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. 
The individual alignments and trees of the seven single genes were compared as well with respect to their performance in species recognition. With ITS and CHS-1 only 7 and 9 species can be recognised, with TUB2 some species close to C. boninense can not be separated, while with HIS3 and CAL some species only differ in one or two bp and form no or only short-branched clades. 
With GAPDH all clades are recognised, but some are also short branched, especially the single strain clades C. beeveri and C. brassicicola that are well differentiated with almost all other genes except for ITS. With ACT the intraspecific variability is very high in some species, which could lead to misidentifications. Taxonomy 
The 86 isolates studied (Table 1) are assigned to 18 species within the Colletotrichum boninense complex based on DNA sequence data and morphology, including 12 species that are new to science. 
Ten species form teleomorph stages in vitro, four species have known anamorphs described in Colletotrichum, while one species, 
G. phyllanthi, has a known teleomorph and is shown here as belonging to the Colletotrichum boninense species complex. All species studied in culture are characterised below.
Species of Colletotrichum represent anamorphic stages of 
Glomerella. Anamorph and telemorph names of fungi will have equal status under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (formerly the International Code for 
Botanical Nomenclature), with the deletion of Art. 59, which takes effect on 1 Jan. 2013. The decision was qualified by a stipulation that uptake of names of anamorphic genera that predate well-known competing teleomorphic names should be ratified by a committee of the International Commission for the Taxonomy of Fungi. The name Colletotrichum (Corda 1831) predates Glomerella (Spauld. & H. Schrenk 1903) and is more commonly used. Consequently we name the new holomorphs as species of Colletotrichum and we do not name the new sexual morphs separately. Furthermore, G. phyllanthi is combined in Colletotrichum as C. phyllanthi. There is precedent for this as Rojas et al. (2010) described Colletotrichum ignotum as having a teleomorph (see Rojas et al. 2010: figs 44–47, table III), although the teleomorphic structures were not included in the formal species diagnosis.

Material examined: Colombia, Meta, Villavicencio, from a leaf of Hevea brasiliensis, 13 Aug. 2010, Olga Castro, (CBS H-20693 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129826 = CH1). 
Notes: This species is sister to a clade that contains C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Colletotrichum annellatum has rather longer asci compared with C. karstii (58–74 µm versus 31.5–56 µm), ascospores that tend to be wider, and smaller appressoria (though these are rarely formed in C. annellatum). Colletotrichum phyllanthi did not produce anamorphic or teleomorphic structures under our growth conditions, so direct comparison of morphological characters was problematic. As its name suggests, C. annellatum frequently produces conidiogenous cells that have annellide-like proliferations on Anthriscus stem, while on SNA conidiogenous cells with a distinct periclinal thickening were predominant. 
Two species referable to Colletotrichum have previously been described from Hevea. Colletotrichum heveae Petch (Petch 1906) has longer and wider conidia than C. annellatum (measured as 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm by its author), and seems to be similar in morphological terms to the C. crassipes group as accepted by Sutton (1980). There are a number of distantly related Colletotrichum taxa with broad conidia and more revisionary work is needed; see also Lubbe et al. (2004) and Cannon et al. (2012, this issue). A further species was published in the same article, Gloeosporium heveae Petch. Many species described in that genus now belong in Colletotrichum, differing only in having sparse or absent setae (von Arx 1970). 
From its description, G. heveae belongs to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate; as it has conidia that measure 12–17 × 3.5–5 µm (i.e. narrower than those of C. annellatum) and conidiogenous cells (“basidia”) measuring 20–34 × 2 µm. Typification of neither species is easy. The only potential type material of either species in K contains a single packet labelled in Petch’s handwriting with “Gloeosporium brunneum Petch & Colletotrichum heveae Petch, no. 2228. On Hevea, 7 Oct. 1905; type of Colletotrichum heveae”. 
The packet contains two young leaves, apparently with only one fungus, corresponding to the description of G. heveae rather than 
C. heveae. The name G. brunneum Petch was apparently never published (it would be a later homonym of G. brunneum Ellis & 
Everh. 1889) and it seems most likely that Petch changed the name of this species between collection and publication. Petch’s names cannot therefore be unequivocally typified, but it seems certain that neither provides an earlier name for C. annellatum. 
Most Colletotrichum isolates derived from Hevea plants have been found to belong to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes (Jayasinghe et al. 1997, Saha et al. 2002, Gazis & Chaverri 2010, Gazis et al. 2011, Damm et al. 2012, this issue). 
However, one isolate from Hevea guianensis in Peru has an ITS sequence placing it in the C. boninense species complex, within C. karstii or C. phyllanthi (Gazis et al. 2011; GenBank HQ022474). The 
ITS sequence of C. annelatum differs in two bp from C. karstii and 
C. phyllanthi. Further research is needed to clarify the placement of the strain from Peru.

Colonies on 
OA flat with entire margin, buff, primrose to greenish olivaceous with orange, dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata and partly with short floccose white aerial mycelium; reverse buff, pale purplish grey, primrose, greenish olivaceous to iron-grey with olivaceous grey spots due to the conidiomata/ascomata shining through, 26.5–29 mm in 7 d (39–40 mm in 10 d). Conidia in mass salmon to orange.
Material examined: New Zealand, Great Barrier Island, from brown lesions on a leaf of Brachyglottis repanda, R.E. Beever, 23 Mar. 2006, (CBS H-20694 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128527 = ICMP 18594).
Notes: This species is characterised by wide conidia and complex appressoria. It forms a sister group to C. brassicicola (from 
Brassica, also from New Zealand) and C. colombiense (from 
Passiflora leaves in Colombia), which have similarly sized and shaped conidia. It differs from C. colombiense by its acute, ± smooth-walled setae and its more elongate conidiogenous cells. In common with C. brassicicola, C. beeveri can produce pycnidium like structures in culture, but none produced spores. 
No species of Colletotrichum has been previously described from Brachyglottis, and none of those species described from members of the Asteraceae originate from Australasia. According to sequence comparisons with six genes, C. beeveri (identified as 
C. boninense) was isolated as an endophyte of healthy roots of 
Pleione bulbocodioides (Orchidaceae) in China (Yang et al. 2011). 
Several endophytic strains from Podocarpaceae leaves from New 
Zealand have the same or similar ITS sequences as C. beeveri (e.g. EU482210, EU482288 and EU482283; Joshee et al. 2009).

Appressoria solitary or in short chains, medium brown, thick-walled, entire edge or crenate, rarely lobate, smooth-walled, irregular in shape, but often bullet-shaped or navicular with an acute tip, (4.5–)7–14(–18) × (4–)5–8(–11) µm, mean ± SD = 10.5 ± 3.3 × 6.4 ± 1.5 µm, L/W ratio = 1.6.
Anamorph developed on Anthriscus stem (CBS 123755).

Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to clavate, apex round, base round with a prominent hilum, sometimes with two big polar guttules, (9–)12–14.5(–16.5) × (4–)5.5–6.5 µm, mean ± SD = 13.2 ± 1.4 × 5.8 ± 0.5 µm, L/W ratio = 2.3. The conidia of CBS 129831 are longer (up to 20 µm) with an average L/W ratio of 2.6.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA flat with slightly undulate margin, hyaline with felty white aerial mycelium on filter paper; reverse filter paper partly pale cinnamon to pale hazel; 25.5–29 mm in 7 d (37.5–40 mm in 10 d). Colonies on OA flat with entire margin; surface covered with felty white, rosy buff or very pale glaucous grey aerial mycelium, in the centre pale luteous aerial mycelium; reverse buff, rosy buff, pale luteous to honey-coloured; 27.5–32.5 mm in 7 d (39–40 mm in 10 d).

Material examined: Japan, Bonin Islands, from a diseased leaf of Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum, 1988, T. Sato, culture ex-holotype CBS 123755 = MAFF 305972; Bonin 
Islands, from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum, 1990, T. Sato, culture CBS 123756 = 
MAFF 306094. Australia, from Leucospermum sp., culture CBS 129831 = STE-U 2965. New Zealand, Northland, Kaipara, from flowers of Solanum betaceum, 1 Feb. 2004, M. Manning, culture CBS 128549 = ICMP 15444.
Notes: Conidia of C. boninense are similar to those of C. karstii, although the ascospores of C. boninense are more uniform with rounded ends, becoming brown and septate with age and the asci are longer and wider. 
We recognise that there is significant genetic variation in C. boninense. Host plants of C. boninense s. str. are very diverse including Amaryllidaceae, Bignoniaceae, Podocarpaceae, 
Proteaceae, Solanaceae and Theaceae. Several ITS sequences, for example HM044131 (Yuan et al., unpubl. data) from Oryza granulata, and FJ449913 (Hu & Guo, unpubl. data) from Dendrobium sp., both presumably from China, are similar to the ITS of C. boninense, C. oncidii and C. cymbidiicola, but these species can not be separated from each other by comparison of ITS sequences.

Material examined: Brazil, Sao Paulo, Bauru City, from fruit anthracnose of 
Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa, 1 June 2006, N. Massola and H.J.Tozze Jr., (CBS 
H-20697 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128501 = ICMP 18607 = PAS12); Sao 
Paulo, Bauru City, from fruit of Passiflora edulis, 1 June 2006, N. Massola and 
H.J.Tozze Jr., CBS H-20696, culture CBS 128528 = ICMP 18606 = PAS10. 
Notes: There are four species in the C. boninense species complex known to occur on Passiflora: C. brasiliense from Brazil (on fruits), 
C. colombiense from Colombia (on leaves), C. torulosum from New 
Zealand (on leaves) and C. karstii from Japan and Colombia (on leaves) and from Brazil (on fruits). According to Johnston & Jones (1997), C. gloeosporioides Group E (= C. novae-zelandiae) and C. gloeosporioides Group I (= C. constrictum) have also been isolated from Passiflora, although this has not been confirmed by molecular methods. Colletotrichum brasiliense and C. colombiense are at this stage known only from Passiflora. Colletotrichum brasiliense is known only from Brazil where it causes anthracnose of yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa; Tozze et al. 2010). Colletotrichum brasiliense is closely related to C. parsonsiae and C. hippeastri. 
Colletotrichum brasiliense is distinguished from these species with most of the genes, including ITS, although the CHS-1 sequence of one isolate was the same as that of C. parsonsii. Appressoria have a lower L/W ratio (1.2) than other species in this group.
There are numerous records of Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium and Glomerella species on Passiflora (Farr & Rossman 2011). 
Two Colletotrichum and two Gloeosporium species have been previously described from Passiflora. Gloeosporium passiflorae 
Speg., described from Passiflora sp. in Argentina, forms longer conidia (20–30 × 5–6 µm) than any of the species in the C. boninense species complex known from Passiflora (Spegazzini 1899). Conidia of C. passiflorae Siemaszko, which was described on leaves of Passiflora edulis in Transcaucasia (today belonging to 
Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia) are smaller, measuring 14–25 × 4–6 µm (Siemaszko 1923). Most of the species treated here have shorter conidia. Only conidia of C. brasiliense isolate CBS

 14 128528 sometimes exceed 20 µm, but their average length is 16.5 µm and their L/W ratio is 3.3 rather than 3.5–4.25 as implied by Siemaszko’s measurements. 
Colletotrichum passiflorae F. Stevens & P.A. Young (Stevens 1925), described on fruits of P. laurifolia and leaves of P. edulis from 
Hawaii, U.S.A., might be an earlier name for several of the species of the boninense complex, but von Arx (1957) treated it as a synonym of the gloeosporioides complex and its description (“Acervuli black, numerous, 90–225 µ in diameter. Setae brown, 50–75 by 5 µm. 
Conidia granular, cylindrical 11–18 by 3.5–6 µm,” Stevens 1925) is inadequate to make an assessment of its identity. Setae of C. constrictum, C. novae-zelandiae, C. karstii and C. torulosum are longer than the length quoted for C. passiflorae by Stevens, but the different growth conditions makes such a comparison unreliable. No living cultures of C. passiflorae appear to have been maintained, so we are forced to regard the name as of uncertain application. The name is not available for any of the species of the C. boninense complex as it is a later homonym of C. passiflorae Siemaszko. 
The name Gloeosporium passifloricola Sawada [as “passifloricolum”], was introduced for a fungus on Passiflora quadrangularis in Taiwan (Sawada 1943), but the name was invalidly published and cannot threaten any of the species presented in our paper.

Material examined: New Zealand, Manawatu-Wanganui, Ohakune, from leaf spot of 
Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera, unknown collection date (July 1998 deposited in 
CBS collection), B. Thrupp, (CBS H-20698 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 101059 = LYN 16331).
Notes: The conidia of C. brassicicola are very short, while ascospores and asci are longer than those of the other four species in the C. boninense species complex with a known sexual morph. 
Farr & Rossman (2011) list six Colletotrichum taxa associated with 
Brassica species: C. truncatum, C. capsici (treated as a synonym of 
C. truncatum by Damm et al. 2009), C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, 
C. gloeosporioides var. minor and C. higginsianum. Colletotrichum truncatum and C. dematium have curved conidia, and belong to separate clades that are not closely related to C. boninense (Damm et al. 2009). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has noticeably longer conidia than species in the C. boninense complex (Sutton 1980, 1992; Weir et al. 2012). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor was reported on Brassica oleracea in Australia (Simmonds 1966) with narrower conidia (11.1–17.7 × 3.1–5.0 µm) and shorter ascospores (13.5–16.8 × 3.5–4.9 µm) (Simmonds 1968) than C. brassicicola. Weir et al. (2012) confirm C. gloeosporioides var. minor as belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, and describe it as a new species, C. queenslandicum. Colletotrichum higginsianum (O’Connell et al. 2004) is part of the C. destructivum complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue) and has longer conidia that tend to be inaequilateral.
Vassiljewski and Karakulin (1950) described Colletotrichum brassicae on Brassica as having slightly curved, fusoid conidia that are longer (19–24 µm) than those of C. brassicicola. Colletotrichum brassicae was regarded as a synonym of C. dematium (von Arx 1957), but no authentic material has been seen. www.studiesinmycology.org

An isolate on Passiflora sp. from Colombia (Pass-65, Afanador
Kafuri et al. 2003) has the same ITS sequence as C. brassicicola, and isolates from leaves of Podocarpus totara and Prumnopitys ferruginea in New Zealand (Joshee et al. 2009) differ by only two or three substitutions in ITS sequences. We cannot be sure whether these strains belong to C. brassicicola or to other segregates of the C. boninense group.

Material examined: Colombia, Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, from a leaf of Passiflora edulis, 22 Jan. 2010, D. Riascos, (CBS H-20699 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129818 = G2); Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, from a leaf of Passiflora edulis, 5 Nov. 2009, 
D. Riascos, CBS H-20700, culture CBS 129817 = G1. 
Notes: Sequences of C. colombiense form a sister group to 
C. beeveri and C. brassicicola. It differs from C. beeveri in morphology by setae that are verrucose and rounded, and shorter conidiogenous cells. Other species isolated from Passiflora have pigmented conidiogenous cells (C. brasiliense and C. karstii on the media used here) or much more complex appressoria (C. torulosum). See under C. brasiliense for a discussion of previously published Colletotrichum taxa associated with Passiflora. 
Many other isolates from Passiflora sp. from Colombia in the study by Afanador-Kafuri et al. (2003) have the same or similar ITS sequence as C. colombiense, but cannot be identified on the basis of ITS only because of the close relationship of the three species.

Material examined: New Zealand, AK, Auckland, from fruit of Citrus limon (lemon), 1 
Dec. 1988, P.R. Johnston, (CBS H-20701 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128504 =

Johnston, CBS H-20702, culture CBS 128503 = ICMP 12936. 
Notes: Colletotrichum constrictum differs from all other species in this complex by the shape and size of the ascospores, which are broader than those of the other species (av. ≥ 7 µm) and have a small L/W ratio (≤ 2.5). In contrast to the other species, the ascospores of C. constrictum are almost straight and often constricted at the centre. Consequently, the asci are also broader than those of other species in the C. boninense complex. The species forms a distinct cluster within all single-gene phylogenies. 
In the multi-gene phylogeny, C. constrictum and C. dacrycarpi form a sister clade to all other taxa within the C. boninense aggregate. 
In blastn searches no ITS sequence was found with more than 96 % identity; matches with other genes were ≤ 93 % identical. The lack of matches may indicate that C. constrictum has a restricted distribution.
Colletotrichum constrictum was previously referred to as C. gloeosporioides group I by Johnston & Jones (1997) and is only known from New Zealand. Isolates studied here are from Citrus sp. and Solanum betaceum. According to Johnston & Jones (1997), the species also occurs on Passiflora edulis and P. mollissima, although this has not been confirmed by molecular methods. Damm et al. 18

Notes: Colletotrichum cymbidiicola occupies one of several clades of the C. boninense aggregate associated with orchids, and is a sister group to C. oncidii, another clade of orchid pathogens. From the limited number of samples available, both species appear host specific at plant genus level. A curious feature of C. cymbidiicola is the size and shape of the ascospores and conidia which both differ considerably when grown on Anthriscus stem, compared with those derived from cultures on SNA. Colletotrichum oncidii did not produce a telemorph under our culture growth conditions; its conidia are also longer in relation to their width when grown on Anthriscus stem compared to SNA cultures, but the difference is not as prominent. Colletotrichum cymbidiicola differs from C. boninense in the shape of the appressoria that are usually lobate with irregular shapes in C. cymbidiicola, while those of C. boninense are typically bullet-shaped to navicular with entire edge or crenate.

On Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata globose, apparently opening by rupture, wall cells medium brown, angular, 7–20 µm diam. Setae not observed. Conidiophores hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, to 50 µm long, developing from a cushion of medium brown, angular to rounded cells, 3.5–12 µm diam. Conidiogenous cells hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, 7.5–23 × 3–5 µm, the opening 1.5–2.5 µm diam, collarette not observed, periclinal thickening observed. 
Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, apex round, base round, granular to guttulate content, (13–)15.5– 19.5(–24) × 5–6(–6.5) µm, mean ± SD = 17.3 ± 2.0 × 5.5 ± 0.3 µm, L/W ratio = 3.2.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA flat with entire margin, hyaline to honey-coloured, with Anthriscus stem, filter paper and medium partly covered white floccose aerial mycelium and grey structures, orange conidial masses in the centre; reverse hyaline, honey to pale salmon, with dark grey spots due to conidiomata or ascomata shining through, 10.5–12.5 mm in 7 d (17.5–20 mm in 10 d). Colonies on OA flat with entire margin, rosy buff to pale flesh with a buff margin, covert with sepia to black conidiomata or ascomata and orange conidia masses in the centre and very sparse white aerial mycelium; reverse buff to rosy buff, 11–12.5 mm in 7 d (16–17.5 mm in 10 d).

Material examined: New Zealand, Auckland, Wenderholm Regional Park, leaf endophyte from Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (kahikatea), 16 Oct. 2009, G. Carroll, (CBS H-20705 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 130241 = ICMP 19107).
Notes: There were no Colletotrichum species described from 
Dacrycarpus species (Podocarpaceae) prior to this study. 
Colletotrichum dacrycarpi does not look like a typical member for the genus, with its slow growth and the production of conidia within closed fruit-bodies with walls that rupture. These closed fruit bodies have been observed in several other species within the C. boninense complex, and the extension of conidiogenous cells to form a new conidiogenous locus is typical of species within the C. boninense complex. Colletotrichum dacrycarpi is one of the most basal members of the overall clade, and forms a sister group to the morphologically distinct C. constrictum. With all single gene phylogenies, C. dacrycarpi is situated on a long branch. Blastn searches with the ITS sequences found no close match.

Hippeastrum vittatum, 23 May 2009, Y.L. Yang, culture ex-holotype CBS 125376 = CSSG1. Netherlands, isolated from leaf of Hippeastrum sp., deposited in CBS from Plantenziektenkundige Dienst Wageningen in May 1978, culture CBS 241.78 = IMI 304052.
Notes: Colletotrichum hippeastri is an outlying species in the C. boninense clade and is distinguished from related species by its large conidia as well as elongate and complex appressoria. A feature that is common with others of the complex is conidiogenous cells that are covered in a gelatinous sheath (not mentioned in the original description by Yang et al. 2009). Phylogenetically

The ColletotriChum boninense species complex 23 informative sequence differences were not detected in the strains studied, and the species forms a distinct cluster within all single gene phylogenies.
All isolates of C. hippeastri are from Hippeastrum, which is a genus of bulb-forming plants native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean (www.wikipedia.org). Strain CBS 119185 from 
Hippeastrum sp. in Brazil, which was unfortunately lost, is the only record of C. hippeastri from the Americas, as determined by the ITS sequence generated by Farr et al. (2006). Isolates included in this study are from China and the Netherlands.

Notes: Based on sequence comparison with six genes (ITS, GAPDH, 
ACT, CAL, TUB2, CHS-1), 46 of the isolates in this study group with 
C. karstii (not shown). Colletotrichum karstii was recently described from a leaf of Vanda sp. (Orchidaceae) in China and reported on several other orchids (Yang et al. 2011). It occurs on many host plants and is the most common and geographically diverse species in the C. boninense complex. Colletotrichum karstii was referred to as C. gloeosporioides groups F and G by Johnston & Jones (1997) who also listed Persea americana and Cucurbita spp. as host plants. Many earlier works have cited isolates of C. boninense that are identified here as C. karstii, including some of those detailed in the original description (Morikawi et al. 2003), some in Farr et al. (2006) and all those in Lubbe et al. (2004). Some isolates from 
Passiflora edulis in Brazil that caused anthracnose on passion Damm et al. 24

The ColletotriChum boninense species complex 25 fruits (Tozze et al. 2010) were identified as C. karstii by GAPDH sequences (GenBank accessions FJ949450 and FJ949452, not included in phylogeny). ITS sequences of endophytic strains of 
C. gloeosporioides “group 2” from Musa acuminata from Thailand (Photita et al. 2005) as well as C. boninense isolates from Persea americana from Mexico (Silva-Rojas & Ávila-Quezada 2011), 
Maytenus ilicifolia from Brazil (Pileggi et al. 2009) and Passiflora sp. in Florida, U.S.A. (Tarnowski & Ploetz 2010) are identical or similar to those of C. karstii (and C. phyllanthi). 
Sequence and morphological variability is high, with differences in conidium size and conidiomatal structures ranging from sporodochial to acervular to closed. This makes identification difficult if based on morphology alone. The conidia of C. karstii are smaller than those of C. hippeastri and C. dracaenae, and broader than those of C. phyllanthi. The asci are shorter than those of C. brassicicola and C. dracaenae, and the shape of the ascospores differs from C. boninense, being slightly wider and less tapered in that species.
Some strains have morphological features that are slightly different from those of strain CBS 127597 described above. Strain 
CBS 129833 forms rather larger asci (190–220 × 140–170 µm) and brown, roundish closed conidiomata that open by irregular rupture, and covered with brown, verrucose to warted hairs/ hyphae, 3–3.5 µm wide. In addition, the setae are more frequent, shorter (40–80 µm long) and broader at the base (5–7.5 µm diam). 
The appressoria are larger, measuring (5.5–)7.5–13(–17) × (4.5–) 5.5–8.5(–10.5) µm, mean ± SD = 10.3 ± 2.6 × 7.1 ± 1.5 µm, L/W ratio = 1.4. This strain and CBS 111998 are also slower-growing than the type; on SNA: 20–22.5 mm in 7 d (32–34.5 mm in 10 d) and 20.5–22.5 mm in 7 d (30.5–31.5 mm in 10 d), and on OA: 21.5–23.5 mm in 7 d (33.5–35 mm in 10 d) and 15.5–16.5 mm in 7 d (25–27 mm in 10 d). There are some indications that CBS 129833 is distinct phylogenetically from the main body of C. karstii strains, but the sequence differences are slight.

Material examined: New Zealand, GB, Gisborne, from ripe fruit rot of Capsicum annuum (sweet pepper), 1 Mar. 1990, P.R. Johnston, (CBS H-20706 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128505 = ICMP 12944); AK, Auckland, from fruit Citrus sp. (grapefruit), 2 Aug. 1988, P.R. Johnston, CBS H-20707, culture CBS 130240 = ICMP 12064.
Notes: Colletotrichum novae-zelandiae is morphologically indistinguishable from other species of the C. boninense species complex. It forms a separate lineage/cluster in all single gene phylogenies, as sister to a group including C. karstii, C. petchii, 
C. annellatum and C. phyllanthi. This species is only known from 
New Zealand where it has been isolated from ripe fruit of Capsicum and Citrus. Johnston & Jones (1997) identified this species as 
C. gloeosporioides group E, and indicated that it was frequently isolated from Citrus fruits and also found on Passiflora edulis, although there was no molecular confirmation.
The only close match in blastn searches (99 % identity) was 
EU670082, the ITS sequence of “Glomerella acutata” strain S43 from Prunus dulcis (almond) in Australia. That strain was isolated together with C. acutatum and was shown to cause lesions on amond fruits in a pathogenicity test (McKay et al. 2009). It was first morphologically identified as C. acutatum by the authors and recognised later as C. boninense using molecular data.
Teleomorphic structures were observed in mated cultures of some strains from Citrus spp. that probably belong to C. novae zelandiae, but their identity has not been confirmed by sequencing. 
Ascomata develop on PDA after 14 d in tight clumps of 4–5, along margins between colonies, mostly lacking an obvious neck or with a short, broad, hyaline ostiolar neck. Asci not observed. Ascospores aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, fusiform to ovoid, usually straight but sometimes slightly curved, measurements range from 12.5–19 × 5.5–7 µm (C1019.1 × C1041.19) to 16–22.5 × 4.5–7 µm (C1010.18 × C1015.3). No teleomorphic structures were observed in cultures derived from single conidia.

Notes: Colletotrichum oncidii forms a sister group to C. cymbidiicola, also orchid pathogens but recorded from the Asia-Pacific region www.studiesinmycology.org 
The ColletotriChum boninense species complex 27 rather than Europe. The known isolates of C. oncidii were from plants in greenhouses, and the ultimate origin of the species is uncertain. It has well-developed strongly setose conidiomata in culture, pale conidia and conidiogenous cells that extend to form new conidiogenous loci. 
Colletotrichum oncidii differs from the closely related C. boninense in forming appressoria that are larger and lobate, while those of C. boninense are entire or crenate. Colletotrichum oncidii also has longer setae (SNA: 65–120, Anthriscus stem: 75–210) that are 2–5-septate on both media, while those of C. boninense are only 20–60 or 30–70 µm long, and 1–2-septate. No teleomorph is known.

Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, apex round, base round, hilum visible, the contents guttulate, (15–)16.5–19(–20) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, mean ± SD = 17.6 ± 1.3 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm, L/W ratio = 3.2.

Material examined: New Zealand, Auckland, leaf endophyte from Parsonsia capsularis, 1 Dec. 2009, G. Carroll, (CBS H-20710 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128525 = ICMP 18590).
Notes: Colletotrichum parsonsiae is known from a single collection on Parsonsia capsularis from New Zealand. There are no 
Colletotrichum species described on Parsonsia and no record of any Colletotrichum sp. on Parsonsia in the USDA Fungus-Host database (Farr & Rossman 2011). The shape and size of conidia differ from other species in the C. boninense complex. Conidia are shorter than those of the closely related C. hippeastri, but longer than those of all other species. The conidial width is the same or less, resulting in comparatively high L/W ratios, especially on 
Anthriscus stem (L/W ratio = 3.7).

The ColletotriChum boninense species complex 31 also larger than those of C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Conidia of C. hippeastri are larger, while C. dracaenophilum occurs on Dracaena spp. as well, but is not closely related to C. petchii as demonstrated by Farr et al. (2006). Their study included CBS 118193 and CBS 118774 (C. petchii). Another species from Dracaena, C. dracaenae fragrantis, has narrower conidia, measuring 5–12 × 2.5–3.5 µm (Saccardo 1895); its affinities are unclear. 
Colletotrichum dracaenicola (syn. C. dracaenae Trinchieri 1909, non Allesch.) may be a synonym of C. dracaenae. The conidial size was given as 12–19 × 2–7 µm by Saccardo & Trotter (1913), which is an unusually wide range, but which overlaps with that of C. dracaenae Allesch. Farr et al. (2006) could not locate the type specimen (it was not present in NAP, PORUN or PAD), and the name therefore remains uncertain.
Von Arx (1957) considered both C. dracaenae Allesch. and C. dracaenae Petch to be synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Farr et al. (2006) agreed with this conclusion concerning C. dracaenae 
Allesch. after studying type material, although their focus was on the need to demonstrate distinctions between C. dracaenae and their new species C. dracaenophilum. The shape of the conidia of C. dracaenae is similar to C. gloeosporioides, including the overall length and the constriction in the central part. The conidia were found to be noticeably wider in C. dracaenae compared with “typical” C. gloeosporioides.
The original description (Allescher 1902) of the conidia of C. dracaenae Allesch. (14–18 × 5–7 µm, elongate-cylindrical, both sides round) fits well with the species as circumscribed here. Most features of the setae also agree (40–60 µm long, obtuse tip, few septa, appearing late at the margins of conidiomata), apart from their diameter (2.5–3.5 µm according to Allescher, 5–10 µm diam as measured here in the CBS strains). In the type material, we found that the conidia measured (12.5–)13.5–16 × 5–6 µm (n = 20, mean ± SD = 15.2 ± 1.1 × 5.4 ± 0.3 µm, L/W ratio 2.8), which is smaller than those of the epitype of C. petchii but with a comparable L/W ratio. Few conidia had a noticeably prominent hilum, and the setae were found to be narrow (as observed by 
Allescher) and slightly verruculose. It is not certain that Allescher’s collection and the CBS isolates represent the same species, as comparisons with dried material and living cultures are difficult. As the conidial hilum morphology seems to diverge from that seen in 
C. petchii (a diagnostic feature of the C. boninense aggregate) we have chosen not to use Allescher’s name. 
Part of the type of C. dracaenae Petch was examined by 
Farr et al. (2006), who noted that the fruit bodies had a very thin subhymenial layer that is only one or two layers thick. No other observations were made, and it is possible that the material they examined was effete. We re-examined the type and found conidiomata typical of the C. boninense aggregate. In concordance with Petch’s original description, the setae are strongly curved and tapering, and strongly verruculose towards the tip. Few conidia were seen and those present were variable in shape and length/ width ratio. The majority of those examined were 14–16 × 5–6.5 µm in size, and were cylindrical to doliiform with a rather prominent hilum. We place Petch’s illegitimate taxon with confidence in the C. boninense aggregate, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that it is synonymous with C. dracaenae Allesch. Petch (1925) contrasted his species with C. cordylines Pollacci but was evidently unaware of Allescher’s work.
In contrast to other species in the C. boninense complex, C. dracaenae may be host-specific to Dracaena. The majority of 
Dracaena species are native to Africa, with a few in southern Asia and one in tropical Central America, and they are often grown as pot plants or in greenhouses. The host species of the isolates studied here are popular houseplants. Colletotrichum dracaenae was mostly isolated from leaves, where it caused leaf spots as indicated in the sampling details of some of the isolates (Di Lenna & Montecchio 1995). Within the species there is only low sequence variability, and separate clusters are obtained with all phylogenies employing single genes.

P.F. Cannon & Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB560746. Basionym: Glomerella phyllanthi H. Surendranath Pai, Mycopath. Mycol. appl. 42: 70. 1970.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA flat with entire margin, hyaline, lacking aerial mycelium; reverse filter paper very pale luteous; 21.3–23.8 mm in 7 d (32.5–33.8 mm in 10 d). Colonies on OA flat with entire to slightly undulate margin; surface buff to saffron, lacking aerial mycelium, reverse same colours; 19–23 mm in 7 d (30.8–35 mm in 10 d). Anamorph and teleomorphic structures not observed in the culture available.
Material examined: India, Maharashtra, Poona, from leaf anthracnose on 
Phyllanthus acidus, 10 Feb. 1966, H. Surendranath Pai, IMI 122826, holotype; 
Maharashtra, Poona, isolated from anthracnose symptoms on leaves of Phyllanthus acidus, 10 Feb. 1966, H. Surendranath Pai, CBS H-7188, isotype, dried culture (PDA) of ascigerous stage, culture ex-isotype CBS 175.67 = MACS 271.
Notes: Glomerella phyllanthi is known only from the original collection taken from leaves of Phyllanthus acidus in India. The ex type strain CBS 175.67, deposited in the CBS collection, did not sporulate under standard growth conditions. The description below is derived from the original publication (Pai 1970).
 “Perithecia isolated or gregarious, dark brown, 159–190.8 µm with long beaks measuring 47.7–150 µm. Ostiolar threads absent. 
Asci numerous, unitunicate, clavate, octosporous, arising in basal layers, sessile to subsessile, 43.2–56.6 × 8.6–10.8 µm. Paraphyses abundant in early stages but disintegrating at maturity. Ascospores uniseriate or irregularly biseriate, elliptical to slightly curved, hyaline with oil globules at both ends, 12.9–17.28 × 2.1–6.4 µm.” 
Ascospore measurements from the isotype (CBS H-7188) agree with those of the original description: (14–)14.5–17(–18) × (4–)4.5– 5.5(–6) µm, mean ± SD = 15.7 ± 1.1 × 5.1 ± 0.6 µm, L/W ratio = 3.1. Pai (1970) assumed that G. phyllanthi was the teleomorph of 
Colletotrichum heveae, and did not provide a complete description of the anamorph, providing the following information: acervuli 113– 159 µm, setae (only formed in old cultures) 63–143 µm, conidia cylindrical, oblong, 14–17 × 3–5 µm. No anamorph structures could be observed in the holotype or isotype specimens.
According to its original description, conidia of Glomerella phyllanthi are narrower than the other species within the C. boninense complex and none formed ascomata with a long beak as reported from G. phyllanthi, though it must be recognised that culture medium and growth conditions were not the same. According to the multigene phylogeny, G. phyllanthi forms a separate lineage close to C. karstii. 
This was the situation also in 5 of 7 single-gene phylogenies.
Glomerella phyllanthi causes an anthracnose disease on leaves of Phyllanthus acidus in India (Pai 1966) but has not been reported since. Farr & Rossman (2011) list C. gloeosporioides from 
Phyllanthus emblica in China (Zhuang 2001) and P. reticulatus in 
Myanmar (Thaung 2008) as well as an unidentified Colletotrichum sp. from P. acidus in India (Mathur 1979), of which at least the latter could be identical with G. phyllanthi. Damm et al. 32 
Pai (1970) regarded C. heveae Petch as the anamorph of G. phyllanthi on the basis of the telemorph strain being pathogenic to four of six Euphorbiaceae plant species tested, including Hevea brasiliensis, along with general morphological similarity. The conidium size of C. heveae was given as 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm by 
Petch (1906), wrongly cited by Pai (1970) as 18–24 × 5–8 µm. 
Type material of Colletotrichum heveae (Sri Lanka, on Hevea, 7 Oct. 1905, Petch 2228, K(M) 167287) is in poor condition with the 
Colletotrichum colonies overrun by saprobic species. The packet indicates that two species are present, Gloeosporium brunneum and C. heveae. Apart from the saprobic fungi the only species now present is a Colletotrichum-like fungus that lacks setae, but with rather variable ± cylindrical conidia with rounded ends that are mostly 14.5–16 × 4–6 µm in size. These are wider than typical C. gloeosporioides conidia and are reminiscent in some features of the C. boninense aggregate, so it is possible that the anamorph teleomorph connection assumed by Pai (1970) is correct. However, there are no authentic cultures of C. heveae and the type material is in a poor state. Gloeosporium brunneum Ellis & Everh. is considered to be the anamorph of Drepanopeziza punctiformis 
Gremmen (von Arx 1970), a north temperate pathogen of Populus and most unlikely to be present on a Hevea leaf from Sri Lanka. 
Use of that name by Petch remains a mystery. According to a note in the CBS database von Arx did not support the teleomorph/ anamorph connection assumed by Pai (1970), and we can see no clear reason why the two taxa should be linked in this way. 
Diseases of Hevea in south India caused by Colletotrichum species are attributable to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum aggregates (e.g. Saha et al. 2002; unpublished ITS sequences from this research deposited in GenBank confirm these identifications to species aggregate level).

Notes: Colletotrichum torulosum occupies a minor clade as sister to a group containing C. boninense s. str. and an unnamed taxon that occurs on orchids (CBS 123921). It has significantly longer conidia than C. boninense with a larger L/W ratio. The conidia formed on 
SNA have hyaline, faintly verrucose vesicles attached to the base adjacent to the conidial scar. The function of these structures is unclear and they may be artefacts. These vesicles also occur on conidia of C. cymbidiicola (Fig. 9R).
Colletotrichum torulosum is known from two New Zealand collections, on Solanum and Passiflora. Endophytic strains from 
Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (Podocarpaceae) and Kunzea ericoides (Myrtaceae) leaves from New Zealand have the same ITS sequences as C. torulosum (EU482212, EU482213; Joshee et al. 2009), although their identity needs to be confirmed by comparison with sequences of other genes. Colletotrichum torulosum is not host-specific. It is not clear whether it is a native New Zealand species that has jumped onto cultivated exotic plants, or has been imported on diseased plant material.DISCUSSION 
Moriwaki et al. (2003) differentiated C. boninense from C. gloeosporioides based on its wider conidia (L/W ratio = (1.8–)2–3(– 3.3), the prominent scar at the conidial base and cream to orange coloured colonies on PDA. The L/W ratio of conidia of C. boninense s. str. and C. karstii (included in C. boninense by Moriwaki et al. 2003) are variable, ranging from 2.1 to 2.8 depending on isolate (and medium), while conidia of C. gloeosporioides have a L/W ratio of 2.6 to 3.0 (Cannon et al. 2008, Weir et al. 2012). According to Moriwaki et al. (2003), the shape of the appressoria in C. boninense differs from that seen in C. gloeosporioides, and setae are rarely produced in C. boninense. Many strains belonging to the C. boninense aggregate have more complex appressoria than those typical for C. gloeosporioides.
None of the morphological characters of C. boninense enables unequivocal identification and misplacement of strains based on morphology alone is common. For example, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides according to morphological characters but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered as a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study shows that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat., but to the C. boninense species complex, although the conidia are largely typical of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio.
Conidiogenesis in the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes is usually percurrent, but more variable in C. boninense, depending on the site of septation in the conidiogenous cell that results in a prominent periclinal thickening. 
Sometimes distinct annellations are formed, which are common in C. annelatum and occasionally occur in C. dacrycarpi and C. petchii. After producing a number of conidia the conidiogenous cells of many species extend without forming a septum and form a new conidiogenous locus at the tip. These processes can alternate, making the conidiogenous cell appear catenate, e.g. in 
C. constrictum, C. novae-zelandiae and C. oncidii. Additionally, several species had an apparent gelatinous multi-layered coating around the conidiogenous cells.
Differentiation between the two species complexes using morphological methods is problematic, but the diagnostic characters established by Morikawi et al. (2003) can be used reliably to identify many isolates. A distinctive feature of the C. boninense complex in morphological terms is the conidiogenous cell with prominent periclinal thickening that extends to form a new conidiogenous locus. This feature is unknown in species of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012). Another distinctive feature of the C. boninense complex is the prominent scar (hilum) at the base of the conidia.
Species of the C. boninense complex appear to be concentrated in certain regions of the world, and prefer certain host plants. Isolates treated in this paper and found by nucleotide blastn searches of 
GenBank originate mainly from New Zealand/Australia, South and 
East Asia (Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, India), South and Central America (Columbia, Brazil, Panama, Mexico, Guyana) and South and East Africa (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya). A number of isolates from Europe (Italy, Netherlands, Germany and probably Hungary) have been associated with indoor/greenhouse plants (Dracaena, Hippeastrum and Gossypium species and several orchids) or air from greenhouses with orchids (Magyar et al. 2011). A few samples from Coffee arabica and Leucospermum originated from U.S.A. (Hawaii) and one from Protea obtusifolia from Madeira (Portugal). 
Four of the species in the C. boninense complex have only been found in New Zealand (two on indigenous plants), and three only from Colombia or Brazil (two of these from Passiflora). The species richness in New Zealand is surprising as no Colletotrichum taxon has previously been described from this country, apart from the formae speciales C. acutatum f. sp. pineum and C. gloeosporioides f. sp. camelliae. Compared with many countries, plant biosecurity is well supported in New Zealand, and both exotic and indigenous species are likely to be surveyed more intensively for pathogens Damm et al.
 34 than in many other regions of the world. Sampling bias is likely an explanation for this phenomenon.
In some Colletotrichum species complexes there is little or no evidence of host specificity even at species level (e.g. Johnston & Jones 1997, Damm et al. 2009), while others appear to be associated with single host genera and/or families, e.g. in the 
C. graminicola and C. orbiculare species complexes (Crouch et al. 2009, Liu et al. 2007). There are indications that a few of the segregate taxa within the C. boninense complex are host-specific, or at least show preference for hosts from particular plant groups. 
Morikawi et al. (2003) detected four molecular subgroups within the species as they defined it, using ITS1 data. The primary branch separated strains from monocotyledonous (monocot) and dicotyledonous (dicot) plant hosts. The dicot clade did not show any clear host-linked substructure, but the monocot clade contained three subclades with one restricted to Orchidaceae and the other two containing strains from Crinum (Amaryllidaceae). The dicot clade corresponds to C. karstii as recognised in this paper, while the monocot clade contains C. boninense s. str. Our research does not support this split. While occuring on a wide range of dicots, 
C. karstii was also described on Orchidaceae and occurs on other monocots as well, especially Musa spp. Of the other segregate species that we recognise, C. dracaenae and C. hippeastri seem to be specific at host genus level, although the number of strains that we have examined is insufficient to confirm these indications. 
A feature of many strains of the C. boninense aggregate is the production of a teleomorph. The Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum have been inadequately studied in comparison to the anamorphs. Von 
Arx & Müller (1954) carried out a global revision using morphological characters and Uecker (1994) completed an ontogenetic study of one 
C. gloeosporioides isolate. We know that at least some strains of most of the principal species aggregates can undergo meiosis, including the C. acutatum group (Guerber & Correll 2001, Guerber et al. 2003, 
Marcelino et al. 2008), the C. destructivum group (Armstrong-Cho & 
Banniza 2006, linked to an anamorph misidentified as C. truncatum), the C. orbiculare group (Rodriguez-Guerra et al. 2005) and the C. graminicola group (Crouch et al. 2009). 
The Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum species are morphologically uniform, with ascospore size and shape the only feature that has been credited with any diagnostic value. There is much overlap in published dimensions and it is not practical to distinguish sexual structures of the C. boninense aggregate from those of the other groups using morphological methods alone. 
Lu et al. (2004) observed high genetic variability among 
Colletotrichum strains, including some from the C. boninense complex, from trees in the Iwokrama Forest Reserve in Guyana by means of ISSR-PCR, RAPD PCR and ITS rDNA sequencing. 
Almost no two strains were genetically identical, and this variability was postulated to be due to meiosis. Comparing about 80 isolates from different tree species in the same area, they also did not detect host specificity, neither at species nor population level. 
Those cultures were not available to us, but some of their ITS sequences diverge from those of the main body of the C. boninense species complex and may represent further segregate taxa. 
The relationship between endophytic and pathogenic isolates of 
Colletotrichum needs more research, as some endophytes may be latent pathogens (Lu et al. 2004), while others appear exclusively endophytic (Rojas et al. 2010). In both studies, endophytes did not appear to be strongly host-specific. Most of the species in our study of the C. boninense species complex are known only from a few isolates, either from a single host genus or from more than one host genus and then with a limited distribution. However, two species were represented by many isolates, C. karstii and C. boninense, of which C. karstii has the widest host range and distribution. Almost all strains that were isolated as endophytes belong to C. karstii, although that species also includes strains derived from diseased plant tissues. More research is needed into the life strategies and host-parasite relations of the fungi belonging to this clade.
Detailed study of the C. boninense complex has demonstrated that even recently recognised species of Colletotrichum may mask extensive variation at the molecular level, and can contain multiple taxa with distinct evolutionary origins. The arguments as to whether these segregate taxa should be recognised at species or infraspecific level (Cannon et al. 2008) have still not been laid to rest, but recent trends are to consider them as independent species. This has the benefit of simplicity when referring to them, but in many cases the name does not infer host specificity or nutritional/biological strategy and is thus of limited practical value to the applied mycologist and plant pathologist. Unfortunately, many of these species cannot be reliably identified at this time using single diagnostic (barcoding) sequences, and this aspect of their systematics must obtain a high priority for the future. On a positive note, we now have substantially more information about the C. boninense complex in terms of its phylogenetic constituents.ACKNOWLEDGEMENTS
