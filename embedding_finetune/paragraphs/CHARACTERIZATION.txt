They cause significant eco nomic damage to crops in tropical, sub tropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by the pathogen (3). Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses are incurred when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as an thracnose, characterized by sunken ne crotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases appear in both developing and mature plant tissues (4). Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infec tions has grouped Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens.
Species of the pathogen appear predomi nantly on aboveground plant tissues; how ever, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.
In this article, we deal in particular with methods used to identify and characterize
Colletotrichum species and genotypes from almond, avocado, and strawberry, as ex amples, using traditional and molecular tools. The three pathosystems chosen rep resent different disease patterns of fruit associated Colletotrichum. 
Multiple Species on a Single Host 
Numerous cases have been reported in which several Colletotrichum species or biotypes are associated with a single host.
For example, avocado and mango anthrac nose, caused by both C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, affect fruit predominantly as postharvest diseases (25,40,41). Straw berry may be infected by three Colleto trichum species, C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, causing anthrac nose of fruit and other plant parts (31).
Almond and other deciduous fruits may be infected by C. acutatum or C. gloeo sporioides (Table 1) (1,5,46,50). Citrus can be affected by four different Colleto trichum diseases (61): postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose, both caused by
C. acutatum, and shoot dieback and leaf spot, and postharvest fruit decay, both caused by C. gloeosporioides. Additional examples of hosts affected by multiple
Colletotrichum species include coffee, cucurbits, pepper, and tomato.
Single Species on Multiple Hosts 
It is common to find that a single bo tanical species of Colletotrichum infects multiple hosts. For example, C. gloeo sporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph: Glomerella cingulata (Stone man) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), which is considered a cumulative species and forms the sexual stage in some instances, is found on a wide variety of fruits, including al mond, avocado, apple, and strawberry (Table 2) (6,15,31,46). Likewise, C. acu tatum J.H. Simmonds has been reported to infect a large number of fruit crops, in cluding avocado, strawberry, almond, ap ple, and peach (1,5,16,25,27). Examples of other species with multiple host ranges include C. coccodes, C. capsici, and C. dematium (14,56).Importance of Species

Plant Disease / June 1998  597 totrichum species–host combination in volved in a given anthracnose incidence alone is often insufficient as a diagnostic indicator of disease etiology. Consequently, to resolve ambiguous disease cases, studies have focused first on taxonomic identifica tion of Colletotrichum species, and second on characterization of subpopulations within each species. Differentiating be tween Colletotrichum species responsible for disease epidemics is vital for develop ing and implementing effective control strategies. A precise determination of the etiology of different Colletotrichum dis eases is essential for understanding the epidemiology of these diseases. It is of paramount importance to investigate whether the same or different pathogens are associated with diseases on different tissues. For example, citrus infection by C. acutatum will cause postbloom drop; whereas C. gloeosporioides is predomi nantly a postharvest pathogen of the same citrus species that may survive in the field as a common saprophyte (61). For effec tive control, it is important to validate that a specific species is indeed the causal agent of a disease that may occur in different geographic locations worldwide. Likewise, breeding for resistance to a given species (22,29,55) depends on accurate etiology of the pathogen in question.
Host specificity. Differentiation be tween Colletotrichum species based on host range or host of origin may not be a reliable criterion for fungi of this genus, since taxa such as C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. acutatum, C. graminicola, and others infect a broad range of host plants. Some taxa appear to be restricted to host families, genera or species within those families, or even cultivars (e.g., bean [51]); whereas others have more extensive host ranges. On the other hand, certain highly specific strains of Colletotrichum have been successfully developed as com mercial mycoherbicides (e.g., C. gloeo sporioides f. sp. aeschynomene for the control of northern jointvetch, a weed in rice and soybean [57]).

Traditional and molecular identifica tion of Colletotrichum. Traditional meth ods for identifying species of Colleto trichum have relied primarily on morphological differences such as colony color, size and shape of conidia, optimal temperature, growth rate, presence or ab sence of setae, and existence of the teleo morph, Glomerella (24,52,56,59). How ever, due to environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms, these criteria are not always adequate for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum spe cies.
Vegetative compatibility, a mechanism that controls genetic isolation of popula tions, has been used extensively to exam ine genetic relatedness in a number of plant pathogenic fungi (34). Vegetative compati bility grouping (VCG) has been used for subspecies analysis of Colletotrichum spe cies, including C. dematium from spinach (11), C. orbiculare from cucurbits (60), C. gloeosporioides from almond (33), C. graminicola from maize (58), and C. acu tatum from strawberry (16).
Over the past decade, various molecular techniques have been used successfully to complement the above-mentioned ap proaches for reliable discrimination among species. For example, arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR) and polymorphisms in nuclear DNA, ribosomal
DNA (rDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and A+T-rich DNA have been utilized to differentiate among populations of C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, C. coccodes, C. fragariae, C. kahawae, C. magna, C. orbiculare, and other species (9,12,19,28,32,49,54). Likewise, the appli cation of CHEF gel analysis and molecular markers to Australian isolates of C. gloeosporioides on the tropical pasture legume, Stylosanthes spp., indicated that two distinct clonal populations appear to exist (26,37,38). In addition, the genetic complexity of Colletotrichum strains in fecting various temperate and tropical fruits has been shown using these tech niques (5,17,19,39).Anthracnose of Almond,Avocado, and Strawberry 
In this and the next sections, we will fo cus on three pathosystems of anthracnose diseases, occurring on fruit of almond, avocado, and strawberry (Fig. 1), which represent different disease patterns of Coll etotrichum. Species of the pathogen on almond, a deciduous crop, infect at initial fruiting stages but do not appear to attack mature fruit or other plant organs (Fig. 1A and B) (1,7,13,46). In contrast, avocado is an evergreen crop, in which the anthrac nose pathogens cause postharvest decay due to latent or quiescent infections initi ating in the field (Fig. 1C) (6,41,42). Un like almond and avocado, which are peren nial, strawberry is predominantly an annual crop. Strawberry anthracnose, caused by either C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and/or C. fragariae, is responsible for seri ous damage on foliar and fruiting plant parts, as well as for root necrosis (16,31,36,52). Damage to strawberry crops is not limited to a certain growth period or storage conditions, and anthracnose may appear throughout the season (Fig. 1D).
Although almond and avocado crops are cultivated in close proximity in Israel, where anthracnose of both crops, caused by C. gloeosporioides, occurs during the spring season, it was not clear whether cross-infection resulted in the field. Like wise, strawberry, infected by C. acutatum, is cultivated in the same geographic re gions and under the same climatic condi tions as those of avocado and almond crops in Israel. Furthermore, a recent report has characterized C. acutatum as the pathogen responsible for almond anthracnose in
California in areas where strawberry and peach anthracnose occur (1). The question raised therefore is whether the pathogens responsible for anthracnose in these loca tions are host-specific, or whether the same pathogen is the causal agent of disease occurring in the three crops. The methods employed in answering this question may be applied to similar situations where sin gle Colletotrichum species attack multiple hosts or where multiple Colletotrichum species appear on a single host, as de scribed.
The approaches used to identify and characterize the anthracnose pathogens in
Israel included (i) traditional methods based on various morphological criteria as well as benomyl sensitivity, (ii) cross-in oculation of different isolates on various fruits to determine host specificity, (iii)
VCG testing to determine relatedness of isolates within and between species, and (iv) molecular analyses to identify Colle totrichum species and to characterize sub populations within species.Identification of Species and
Characterization of Subspecies 
Characterization of Colletotrichum spe cies has relied on a number of criteria, including morphology, optimal growth temperature, vegetative compatibility, be nomyl sensitivity, and molecular methods.
In this section, we elaborate on the ap proaches used to differentiate between isolates of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose on almond, avocado, and strawberry crops in Israel. 
Traditional methods. In general, con idia of C. acutatum are elliptic-fusiform in shape; whereas conidia of C. gloeosporioi des are oblong with obtuse ends. However, this criterion, as well as the size of conidia, is not consistent enough for discerning species.
Numerous reports suggest that isolates of C. acutatum grew at a significantly slower rate than isolates of C. gloeospor ioides (5,50,52). However, growth rate of
C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond in
Israel was slow and did not differ significantly from that of C. acutatum from strawberry. In fact, growth rate and optimal temperature have been useful for differ entiating between subpopulations of C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond crops (Table 2) (47).
Colony shape and color of cultures may vary considerably within and between species. For instance, most isolates of C. acutatum (including the almond pathogen from California) show a red-salmon pig mentation in reverse culture; whereas the coloration of C. gloeosporioides cultures varies from white to dark gray (Table 1).
Several morphological types have been observed within a population of C. gloeosporioides from avocado grown in 
Fig. 2. Benomyl (5 µg/ml) sensitivity assay of Colletotrichum acutatum isolates from almond (California) and strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond (Israel) and avocado. Only the avocado isolate is sensitive to benomyl. 
Plant Disease / June 1998  599 culture (T. Katan, unpublished): (i) con idial type, with masses of conidia and no aerial mycelium; (ii) flat mycelial type, with very little aerial mycelium or conidia; (iii) mycelial type, with dense aerial my celium; (iv) conidial-mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium and masses of con idia; (v) protoperithecial type, similar to type iv but also producing dark protoperi thecia-like hyphal aggregates; and (vi) perithecial type, with simple or complex perithecia. The existence of the teleomorph
Glomerella may sometimes help in differ entiating between species; however, the sexual stage has only been observed in some isolates of C. gloeosporioides from avocado (T. Katan and S. Freeman, unpub lished), but not from almond. In contrast to the morphological heterogeneity observed among the C. gloeosporioides isolates from avocado, the population originating from almond in Israel had uniformly growing white-to-gray colonies. It may be concluded that colony color and shape of conidia are unsatisfactory methods for identification of species, primarily due to the diversity of these characteristics in C. gloeosporioides, which is indicative of its heterogeneity.
Benomyl sensitivity. Screening of fun gicide sensitivity has been used primarily to estimate the potential of such com pounds for chemical control (18,30). It was found that in some cases, fungicide sensi tivity can also be used for species and sub specific grouping in Colletotrichum. In general, C. gloeosporioides isolates are considered highly sensitive to benomyl; whereas C. acutatum isolates are relatively insensitive (5,9,35). According to our studies, C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond differ in their sensitivity to benzimidazole fungicides: almond isolates are insensitive to benzimidazoles, retaining 40 to 50% growth at 0.5 µg/ml (benomyl), with little further reduction at 50 µg/ml, compared with complete growth inhibition of isolates from avocado at 5 µg/ml (Fig.
2) (45–47). Likewise, C. acutatum isolates from strawberry grown in Israel and Cali fornia, and from almond grown in Califor nia, were insensitive to the above-men tioned concentrations of benomyl (Fig. 2).
Additional studies have shown that C. acutatum from almond, peach, and straw berry crops from California is insensitive to benomyl (1). This simple method can therefore be utilized for additional charac terization of local populations of Colleto trichum associated with particular anthrac nose diseases (1,9,35).Host Specificity
Cross-infection potential has been re ported among different species of Colleto trichum and genotypes of C. gloeosporioi des on a variety of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits under artificial inocu lation conditions. For example, isolates of 
Fig. 3. Artificial inoculation of (A) apple (cv. Golden Delicious), (B) almond (cv. Ne plusultra), and (C) avocado (cv. Fuerte) fruits with Colletotrichum isolates from vari ous hosts (as indicated by attached labels).
 600  Plant Disease / Vol. 82 No. 6 
C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from a variety of temperate fruits caused disease symptoms that were visually indistinguish able when inoculated on detached peach fruits (5). C. gloeosporioides isolates from seven tropical fruit crops were also shown to cross-infect alternate detached leaves and fruits, and the success of infection appeared to be dependent on inoculum density (2). In studies conducted in Israel, it was of interest to determine whether avocado anthracnose was caused by the same subspecies of C. gloeosporioides as that responsible for almond anthracnose, since almond groves are situated alongside avocado plantations in some cultivation areas. Similarly, other crops, such as anemone, apple, mango, and strawberry, are known to be susceptible to Colleto trichum in Israel. To determine the poten tial of cross-infection, isolates from differ ent crops were cross-inoculated on various hosts.
Our study showed that C. gloeosporioi des isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango, as well as C. acutatum isolates from anemone, apple, and peach, infected detached fruits of the other hosts, including apple (two varieties), avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine (Fig. 3) (21). These results demonstrated cross-infection po tential between two species, C. gloeospor ioides (including representatives of distinct subpopulations from almond, apple, avo cado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach), on a variety of fruit spe cies. However, these experiments were conducted under the extreme conditions commonly applied in artificial inocula tions; whereas isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence that cross-infection had occurred under field conditions.
VCG. Studies of vegetative compatibil ity offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic popula tions of Colletotrichum species (8,11,60).
Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thereby con stituting a distinct genetic population (34,43).
VCG studies were conducted with iso lates of Colletotrichum from almond (from
Israel and the United States), avocado (Israel), and strawberry (Israel) crops, to determine the genetic relatedness within and between populations. These Israeli isolates of C. gloeosporioides and Califor nian isolates of C. acutatum from almond belonged to single, distinct VCGs and formed complementary heterokaryons between mutants from different isolates only within each population (Fig. 4) (45).
Almond isolates from Israel were not com patible with local isolates of Colleto trichum from avocado, indicating that the almond population constitutes a distinct subspecific group within C. gloeosporioi

Plant Disease / June 1998  601 des (33). On the other hand, C. gloeosporioides from avocado comprises multiple VCGs, and coupled with its di verse morphology, further indicates het erogeneity of this population (S. Freeman and T. Katan, unpublished). In contrast, isolates of C. acutatum from different plant parts of strawberry, including fruit and roots, originating from different regions were all vegetatively compatible with one another, indicating uniformity and clonality of the local pathogen population (16). Al though the VCG method cannot be used for the taxonomic classification of Colle totrichum species, it is useful for delineat ing asexually reproducing subpopulations within species.
Molecular techniques. Since traditional methods have not been satisfactory for differentiating between species and sub species of Colletotrichum, molecular ap proaches have gained popularity over the last decade. Molecular methods have been employed successfully to differentiate between populations of Colletotrichum from many hosts in general, and in our case, from almond, avocado, and straw berry in particular.
A. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) analysis.
rDNA genes appear as multiple copies in the genome. Due to lesser conservation of sequence, the nontranscribed and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA subunits are suitable for detection of recent evolu tionary divergence within Colletotrichum. In our work, limited restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified rDNA were used to differentiate representative isolates of C. gloeosporioides from a diverse host range, from rDNA of C. acutatum from strawberry (17).
Species-specific primers have been de signed primarily according to dissimilari ties in the sequence of the ITS regions of representative isolates of Colletotrichum from different species (9,28,32,39,53). We have used such primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioi des (Fig. 5). As can be seen in Figure 5A, a single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range, but not in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, using primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and
C. fragariae, isolates of these two species were similar to one another but could be distinguished from those of C. acutatum by amplification of a specific 450-bp fragment (Fig. 5B). This method also made it possi ble to distinguish between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry on the one hand and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus on the other (1).
These results demonstrate that rDNA analysis is adequate as a taxonomic tool for species identification and for diagnostic pathogen detection in planta, but not for revealing subpopulations within a species.
B. Polymorphisms in nuclear DNA. Re petitive DNA elements have been useful for restriction fragment length polymor phism (RFLP) grouping of various isolates of Colletotrichum species (37,44). For example, a repetitive nuclear DNA element (GcpR1), originally from the bean anthrac nose pathogen C. lindemuthianum (44), was used successfully to differentiate among 10 species of Colletotrichum by producing unique polymorphic patterns for each representative species (Fig. 6A).
When GcpR1 was used to compare C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado in Israel, the band patterns of the almond isolates were uniform and distinct from those of avocado isolates (17). Within the avocado isolates, polymorphic frag ments were observed in accordance with the morphologic and VCG heterogeneity of this population.
C. Analysis of A+T-rich DNA associated with mitochondrial (mt)DNA. A+T-rich
DNA, associated with the mitochondrial (mt) genome, can be detected by the re striction enzyme HaeIII, which recognizes and cleaves the DNA sequence GGCC. A+T-rich DNA is cleaved infrequently by
HaeIII; whereas most of the nuclear DNA is digested to fragments of less than 2 kb in 
Fig. 6. Interspecies restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) band patterns of DNA of 10 different Colletotrichum species, (A) digested with PstI and hybridized with GcpR1 for nuclear DNA analyses, and (B) digested with HaeIII for A+T-rich DNA analyses.

 602  Plant Disease / Vol. 82 No. 6 size (19). HaeIII RFLPs of A+T-rich DNA were used successfully to characterize
Colletotrichum isolates from 10 species whereby each representative revealed unique restriction patterns (Fig. 6B). The results of this approach were similar to those obtained using the GcpR1 repetitive element, whereby C. gloeosporioides iso lates from almond had unique band pat terns, in contrast with polymorphic frag ments observed for avocado isolates (17).
This approach also allowed grouping of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach and differentiation among C. gloeosporioi des isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango (21).
D. ap-PCR. ap-PCR or random ampli fied polymorphic DNA (RAPD) has been used extensively for identification and characterization of isolates in Colleto trichum (2,12,53,54). We employed ap
PCR, using primers derived from minisat ellite or repeat sequences (CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG, TGTCTGTCTGTCTGTC,GACACGACACGACAC, GACAGACAG
ACAGACA), for comparing Colleto trichum species from almond, avocado, strawberry, and other fruits. Unique band patterns were observed among the clonal populations of C. acutatum from straw berry and C. gloeosporioides from almond; whereas avocado isolates exhibited poly morphisms. ap-PCR was used to accurately and reliably differentiate among C. acuta tum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae from strawberry (16,20): C. acutatum and
C. fragariae populations shared a common band pattern, and the patterns for C. gloeosporioides were polymorphic. This method was useful in taxonomic identifi cation of strawberry isolates from South
Carolina as C. acutatum based on unique amplification products, in determining the uniformity of Israeli C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, and in demonstrating heterogeneity within the species C. gloeosporioides in general, as illustrated by multiple band patterns (Fig. 7). Varying band patterns indicate that C. acutatum isolates from various hosts, including anemone, almond, apple, peach, pecan, and strawberry, cumulatively represent three genotypes, and that the overall heterogene ity is apparent within this species (Fig. 8).
In summary, rDNA analysis is a reliable method for taxonomic species identifica tion; whereas analysis using GcpR1 and other repetitive DNA elements, A+T-rich
DNA RFLPs, and ap-PCR are useful methods for determining subpopulation diversity within species.
Effect of Teleomorphism on Genetic Diversity 
Although C. gloeosporioides infects hundreds of different plant species (56), individual strains may have restricted host ranges, as demonstrated by the clonal sub population of C. gloeosporioides from almond grown in Israel (17,33). It is often presumed that host-specific populations reproduce only asexually, although certain isolates of C. gloeosporioides with differ ent host specificities mate under laboratory conditions (10). Highly variable popula tions are more adaptable to changing con ditions than are those with little variation, and sexual reproduction and recombination is a major factor that contributes to the genetic variability observed in fungal populations. C. gloeosporioides is a highly variable species, as shown by morphologi cal characters and molecular markers. As mentioned above, C. gloeosporioides from avocado is heterogeneous and genetically complex (17). Furthermore, it is known that some strains of C. gloeosporioides/G.
cingulata from avocado produce the sexual stage in culture (48; T. Katan, unpublished) and therefore may also reproduce via their
G. cingulata teleomorph stage in the or chard. These findings are in contrast with the uniform genotype and single VCGs found among C. gloeosporioides from almond and C. acutatum from strawberry, which are strictly vegetatively reproducing clonal populations (16,17,33). The data suggest that recombination of vegetative incompatibility and other loci that occurs during sexual reproduction results in a high degree of genetic variation among C. gloeosporioides strains on avocado. Alter natively, the population may consist of numerous vegetatively (asexually) repro ducing clones. These two reproduction strategies are not mutually exclusive and may coexist.Summary
Colletotrichum is a broad-range patho gen with cases of multiple species on a single host on the one hand (Table 1), and single species on diverse hosts on the other

Plant Disease / June 1998  603 (Table 2). In this article, we have empha sized that certain populations of Colleto trichum appear to be host-specific, for example C. gloeosporioides from almond in Israel. However, in other geographic regions the same host may be attacked by additional species, as recently demon strated with C. acutatum causing almond anthracnose in California. 
Numerous reports have determined that cross-infection potential exists among dif ferent species of Colletotrichum on a mul titude of hosts. These studies were mainly conducted on detached plant material, such as fruit and leaves. Although artificial host inoculation is usually not reliable enough for assessing host specificity, it indicates the potential for infection. Our studies have emphasized this point, showing that C. gloeosporioides from almond grown in
Israel was able to infect various fruits un der artificial inoculation conditions, but isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence that cross-infection had occurred under field conditions.
The fact that Colletotrichum species dif fer in their sensitivity to certain fungicides such as benomyl is critical for chemical pathogen control. This should be accounted for when implementing a spray program where a mixed population exists, such as
C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides in apple, citrus, mango, peach, pecan, and strawberries, since differential sensitivity may result in a shift in population ratio.
The use of traditional methods (mor phology, colony color, conidia size, etc.) may not be accurate enough for identifica tion of species and subspecies, which is critical for disease management, resistance breeding, and pathogen control. Vegetative compatibility and molecular approaches offer complementary means for characteri zation of species. Molecular approaches have been utilized successfully for taxo nomic identification and determination of genetic diversity of Colletotrichum popu lations. In a number of recent studies, spe cies-specific primers have been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from various hosts. In order to use this approach more success fully for pathogen diagnosis in vivo, it is necessary to develop simple and rapid
DNA extraction techniques, to allow mul tiple sampling and testing. Where Colleto trichum is considered a quarantine patho gen, DNA can be transferred safely between countries for diagnostic purposes, thus avoiding pathogen dissemination.
Population diversity is hypothesized to stem primarily from sexual reproduction.
Understanding and observing the sexual stage is important in determining whether a population is homogeneous or heterogene ous, and for developing a sexual genetic system. The use of classical morphology and molecular tools may contribute to the understanding of the complexity of certain populations, such as that of C. gloeo sporioides from avocado, which produces the teleomorph in culture and may survive and proliferate in the same manner in na ture.Future Outlook
Many anthracnose-susceptible hosts are cultivated worldwide. Damage to yield is especially significant in the tropics, where multiple hosts such as mango, avocado, coffee, papaya, banana, and citrus are grown in close proximity. Therefore, the complexity related to host range and speci ficity in the genus Colletotrichum must be determined for each host at every given location.
Future research should attempt to deter mine host specificity of Colletotrichum species primarily according to natural in fections rather than artificial inoculations.
Artificial infections are easy to obtain on detached leaves and especially on ripe fruit under experimentally controlled conditions in the laboratory. But since such experi ments often use high inoculum levels and optimized humidity and temperature, their results may not accurately reflect the true virulence potential.
The taxonomy of Colletotrichum species is in a state of constant flux and remains confusing. The situation is complicated in particular with the species C. acutatum and
C. gloeosporioides, which attack several hosts. Due to their broad (sometimes overlapping) host ranges and phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides are considered cumulative species composed of diverse subpopulations. Although the traditional methods to classify these fungi into distinct species are based primarily on morpho logical criteria, deviation from type-culture characteristics and the presence of inter mediate forms have introduced ambiguity into species identification. The validity of these mycotaxons as “mycological (for merly botanical) species” is beyond the scope of this article but seems to be sig nificant from a phytopathological point of view.
Of the molecular approaches mentioned earlier, the use of species-specific primers for PCR amplification of unique rDNA fragments seems the most promising for differentiating among the species of Coll etotrichum. Since PCR-based methods are relatively simple, this approach should be further developed by adjusting the avail able primers and designing new ones for unequivocal identification of all (problem atic) species. The dependability of these primers should be validated by testing them with Colletotrichum strains repre senting diverse populations of each species.
Although subpopulations have been rec ognized within C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, their taxonomic status is unclear. From the phytopathologic view point, the considerable pathogenic varia tion evident within these species (often coupled with additional phenotypic varia tion) may warrant further dissection into subspecific groups designed to reflect host specificity. Ideally, the species name should refer to a broad grouping, with strains from the subspecies level indicating host specialization. The general accept ability of such subgrouping may require additional support, based on biological criteria independent of pathogenicity. Mo lecular and VCG analyses are likely candi dates to provide the necessary information.
Molecular approaches have been widely used, and their power for characterization

Carolina); PCN-5 (C. acutatum from pecan, Alabama); PCH-8 (C. acutatum from peach,
S. Carolina); ANE-IMI (C. acutatum IMI-223120 from anemone); and ANE-3A (C. acuta tum from anemone, Israel). Lanes M contain DNA size markers in kilobases.
 604  Plant Disease / Vol. 82 No. 6 of isolates is well recognized. However, the applicability of the various techniques for overall delineation of subspecific sub populations has yet to be determined. In particular, the capacity to accurately iden tify phenotypically similar strains from diverse sources and to separate them from other phenotypes by molecular markers must be demonstrated.
VCG analysis, commonly used to study formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum, has only been applied in a few cases to determine population structure in Colleto trichum spp. Identification of species by this method is confined to populations that are vegetatively compatible with well-de fined reference strains. Within species, subdivision by VCG has proven very de pendable, as evidenced by correlation with genotypes and phenotypic traits. VCG determination is based on multi-locus con trolled self/nonself discrimination between fungal strains, and its results are clear-cut in most cases. It is only applicable to anamorphic, clonally related populations.
In sexually reproducing populations with a
Glomerella stage, relationships can be determined by sexual compatibility, which is the ultimate criterion for delineating mating populations within a species. Un like the DNA-based methods, tests based on VCG and sexual crosses employ living fungi. Consequently, strains to be com pared may have to be moved from one geographic location to another, thus creating a risk of undesired pathogen dissemination.
Additional work should concentrate on trying to link molecular markers to bio logical traits, such as morphology, VCG, and virulence. There is no biological meaning to PCR-amplified bands from random primers that are unrelated to func tional genes. However, RAPDs can still maintain their importance in a population genetics study at the subspecies level.
Additional areas of study should emerge with the recent observation of the teleo morph of C. acutatum from apple and blueberry in the southeastern United States (23). Multiple genotypes of C. acutatum exist as well as isolates of the species ap pearing on multiple hosts. Although clonal populations have been observed (e.g., on strawberries in Israel), it remains to be seen whether the presence of the sexual stage may significantly contribute to ge netic diversity within C. acutatum, simi larly to that hypothesized for C. gloeosporioides.Acknowledgments
