In 2013, fruits and leaves of Litchi chinensis [No Mai 
Tsz (73-S-20)] with symptoms of pepper spot (Cooke and 
Coates, 2002) were collected from Yunlin county in Taiwan. 
Diseased leaf tissue was surface-sterilized with 70% etha nol and placed on acidified potato dextrose agar (APDA). 
A single spore isolate (C-1001) with aerial white mycelium that turned gray at 25°C and a 12 h photoperiod produced salmon conidial masses after 10 days. Conidia were hyaline, aseptate, cylindrical, 14.3 (12.77-15.38) × 4.9 (3.95-5.56) μm in size. For further identification, partial sequences of ac tin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehye-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) (Weir et al., 2012) were generated and deposited in GenBank (accession 
Nos. MF098594, MF135496, MF098596, MF098598 and 
MF135494, respectively). Baysian inference analysis using multilocus alignment with the deposited sequences placed the isolate (C-1001) in the same clade with the ex-type of C. siamense (ICMP 18578) (Weir et al., 2012). Based on cultural characteristics, conidial morphology (Sutton, 1992) and phy logenetic analysis, the fungus was identified as Colletotri chum siamense (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Pathogenicity tests were conducted in the field. Young leaves of lychee cv. ‘No Mai 
Tsz (73-S-20)’ were inoculated using a conidial suspension (1.5 × 106 conidia/ml) and covered with moist plastic bags for 48 h. Dark lesions of the pepper spot disease developed on leaves 4 weeks after inoculation. C. siamense was reisolated from the inoculated leaves. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing pepper spot disease of lychee in Taiwan.

Red oak or Tuchi (Quercus crassipes) is an ornamental endemic species of Mexico. On November 9, 2016, pow dery mildew was observed on leaves of Tuchi in Santa Fe, 
Mexico City. The symptoms and signs included deformed leaves, irregular necrotic lesions on both sides of the leaf, premature leaf drop, chasmothecia and mycelium. A refer ence specimen (CMPH-ECO23S) was deposited in the Her barium of the Colegio de Postgraduados. The fungus pro duced light brown to dark reddish chasmothecia immersed in the mycelium. Chasmothecia were grouped or dispersed, 99-111 μm in diameter, composed of polygonal peridial cells of 12-18 μm; with simple, sinuous, poorly developed, short, or almost absent mycelial appendages (4-4.5 μm wide) that were interlaced with the surrounding mycelium. The single ascus was hyaline, ellipsoid or ovoid to globose, sessile, 80 91 × 55-68 μm to 134 × 85 μm. The ascospores were hyaline, ellipsoid to ovoid, 25-32 × 18-22 μm. Conidiophores and co nidia were not observed. Amplification of ITS was carried out using primers ITS4 and ITS5. The PCR product (459 bp) was sequenced and deposited in GenBank (accession No. 
MF170000). The obtained sequence showed 100% similarity to AF011289 from Q. agrifolia. No ex-type sequence of C. lanestris is in GenBank, but the type and this sequence are from Q. agrifolia in California, USA. Based on morphologi cal and molecular characteristics, the fungus observed on 
Quercus crassipes was identified as Cystotheca lanestris (Braun and Cook, 2012). To our knowledge, this is the first report of this fungus causing powdery mildew of red oak in Mexico.
