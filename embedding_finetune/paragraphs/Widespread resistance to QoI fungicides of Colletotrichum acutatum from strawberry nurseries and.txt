Accepted for publication 6 November 2018.Abstract 
Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a major disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The use of fungicides, such as the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been extensively deployed for the control of C. acutatum for the past 20 years. C. acutatum resistance to the QoIs was first reported in 2013 in Florida strawberry production fields. In 2015, anthracnose outbreaks were reported in strawberry nurseries and production fields across the United States. To elucidate the significance and geographical extension of C. acutatum resistance, fungicide use surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected in the af fected areas. QoI-resistant isolates were collected from strawberry production fields and nurseries in six states in the United States. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in some locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommendation for this fungicide group. Thus, the current situation warrants im mediate changes in anthracnose management strategies that integrate other chemical as well as nonchemical strategies to limit resistant population selection and prevent future anthracnose outbreaks.
Strawberry anthracnose, caused by species in the Colletotrichum acutatum complex, primarily C. nymphaeae, is one of the main diseases limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012;
Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al.
2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acu tatum infections are flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b;
Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Flower infections may result in the appearance of brown lesions on infected petals, whereas fruit in fections appear as dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on the surface, making the fruit undesirable for consumption (Peres et al.
2005). Under severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur at the nurseries, leading to plant stunting and collapse in fruit production fields (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).
Although C. acutatum infections are commonly observed in strawberry production fields, it has been suggested that quiescently infected transplants originating from nurseries are the inoculum source for field infections (Howard et al. 1992; Peres et al. 2005). In
Florida, strawberry is treated as an annual crop and is cultivated throughout the winter. In the off season during the summer, the extreme hot temperatures in Florida are detrimental to the survival of C. acutatum present in the soil and plant debris (Ureña-Padilla et al. 2001).
Strawberry transplants are produced in nurseries mainly located in northern latitudes, in Canada, or in higher altitudes in North
Carolina and California (Brown 2003). Low temperatures may limit disease development but do not eliminate the pathogen from strawberry transplants. Daughter plants originating from mother plants are propagated in nurseries and sold to strawberry growers or to smaller nurseries, which will then propagate additional stock material. Because transplants are propagated vegetatively, patho gens such as C. acutatum may also be transmitted to newly formed plants (Strand 2008). Upon arrival in strawberry production fields in Florida, quiescently infected transplants are exposed to weather conditions, such as prolonged wetness periods and temperatures between 20 and 30�C, that are ideal for C. acutatum infection and anthracnose development (Forcelini et al. 2017; MacKenzie andPeres 2012).
C. acutatum control is highly dependent on frequent and nu merous applications of multi- and single-site fungicides (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). Multisite fungicides, such as captan, although providing satisfactory control of C. acutatum, have no curative effect, and weekly applications are required during the season (Mertely et al. 2017b). Single-site fungicides, such as the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), have a postinfection effect on anthrac nose, but growers are limited to a small number of applications that can be made throughout the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Owing to the few QoI appli cations permitted during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multisite fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. However, to deliver symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have been frequently deployed in nurseries, and fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another important pathogen of strawberry, have been selected (Oliveira et al. 2017).
QoI fungicides target the cytochrome b (cytb) gene, inhibiting fungal mitochondrial respiration (Bartlett et al. 2002; Sauter et al.
1999; Ypema and Gold 1999). Azoxystrobin is a QoI fungicide that has been registered for anthracnose control on strawberry for several decades (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). However, the intensive use of such fungicides has led to the selection of C. acutatum populations resistant to QoI fungicides (Forcelini et al. 2016). QoI resistance was first found during the 2013 to 2014 strawberry †Corresponding author: Natalia A. Peres; E-mail: nperes@ufl.edu

Resistant C. acutatum isolates har bored either the F129L or the G143A mutations in the cytb gene, which were associated with moderate and complete resistance to the
QoIs, respectively. During the 2015 to 2016 strawberry season, anthracnose outbreaks were reported in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the United States. Thus, the objectives of this study were to (i) determine sensitivity to azoxystrobin of C. acutatum isolates collected in strawberry nurseries and production fields from a wide range of geographical locations and (ii) survey the current disease management programs implemented in strawberry nurseries.
Monitoring C. acutatum Sensitivity to Azoxystrobin in Nursery and Production Fields
In total, 232 monoconidial isolates belonging to the C. acutatum species complex were isolated from anthracnose-affected straw berry organs and used in this study. Isolates were collected from strawberry plants from nurseries located in California and North
Carolina, or from fruit production fields in California, Florida,
Georgia, Louisiana, North Carolina, and Virginia during the 2015 to 2016 strawberry production season. Nursery source information for isolates collected in fruit production fields was also collected when available. Isolates were stored dry on filter paper inside a sterile envelope in an airtight container with Drierite (W.A. Hammond
Drierite Company, Xenia, OH) at –20�C or in 30% sterile glycerol at –80�C.
Isolate sensitivity to azoxystrobin was evaluated based upon mycelial growth with two discriminatory doses of azoxystrobin (3 and 100 µg/ml). The commercial formulation of azoxystrobin (Abound 2.08F, 22.9% active ingredient; Syngenta Crop Protection,
Greensboro, NC) was used for the fungicide sensitivity assays.
Salicylhydroxamic acid was not incorporated into the medium, be cause Forcelini et al. (2016) reported that C. acutatum isolates from strawberry do not utilize an alternative respiration pathway. For isolate revival, a small piece of filter paper (�4 mm2) or of glycerol containing the isolate was placed on a 90-mm-diameter Petri plate with potato dextrose agar (PDA) (Oxoid, Basingstoke, U.K.) and grown for 7 days at 24�C under constant light. One 6-mm-diameter plug from the periphery of the colony was removed and placed on
Petri plates containing either PDA, PDA + azoxystrobin (3 µg/ml), or
PDA + azoxystrobin (100 µg/ml). Plates were sealed, and fungal colonies were incubated at 24�C under constant light for 3 days.
Mycelial growth was determined as the average length of two radius measurements. Isolates were considered sensitive to azoxystrobin if mycelial growth inhibition on the medium amended with 3 µg/ml of azoxystrobin was ³50% than the control. If mycelial growth was not inhibited at 3 µg/ml of azoxystrobin but was inhibited at 100 µg/ml, the isolate was considered moderately resistant. Isolates that were not inhibited at 100 µg/ml were designated completely resistant (Fig. 1).
Three plates per fungicide concentration and two plates for the control treatments were used for each isolate. The experiment was conducted twice.
Among the 232 C. acutatum isolates evaluated, 83 (36%) were resistant to azoxystrobin. All resistant isolates were considered completely resistant to azoxystrobin. That is, mycelial growth was not inhibited even when exposed to 100 µg/ml of azoxystrobin.
Moreover, we found resistant isolates that originated from fruit (Fig. 2), which differs from the first C. acutatum QoI resistance outbreak in Florida, for which the majority of resistant isolates were collected from root and crown tissue (Forcelini et al. 2016).
Isolates resistant to the QoIs were found in all six states. Cal ifornia nurseries and production fields were the origin of the ma jority of C. acutatum isolates (91) collected during the 2015 to 2016 season. Of the 91 isolates, 16 were resistant to azoxystrobin. Forty of the 52 isolates collected from fruit originating from production fields in Louisiana were also QoI resistant. Of the 40 resistant isolates, 36 originated from a nursery in California and four from a nursery in Canada. In Georgia, 23 isolates were collected, and 13 were considered resistant, whereas in Virginia, five of the 43 isolates were azoxystrobin resistant. In North Carolina, 14 isolates were collected and five were resistant. Five isolates were collected from the University of Florida Gulf Coast Research and Education
Center research field; four of those isolates were resistant (Fig. 3).
Survey of Fungicide Use in Strawberry Nurseries
Surveys were conducted from 2015 to 2017 to elucidate disease management programs implemented in 10 strawberry nurseries across the United States and Canada. Nurserymen were asked to answer a brief questionnaire on fungicide use during the plant FIGURE 1

PDA + 100 µg/ml of azoxystrobin. When compared with the control (PDA), sensitive isolates inhibited mycelial growth by ³50% when exposed to 3 µg/ml of azoxystrobin. If mycelial growth was not inhibited at 3 µg/ml of azoxystrobin but was inhibited at 100 µg/ml, the isolate was considered moderately resistant. Isolates not inhibited at 100 µg/ml were designated as completely resistant.FIGURE 2

The information gathered from the surveys was analyzed and separated into the following categories: nursery location (state or country), Fungicide Resistance Action Committee (FRAC) group, and number of applications per season. However, because we were only evaluatingC. acutatum sensitivity to QoIs in this study, we focused only on the number of applications of products that contained
QoIs as the main active ingredient or as part of a premixture.
The majority of the nurseries surveyed followed the recom mendations on the products’ labels and made five or fewer ap plications of QoI fungicides, such as azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, or premixtures containing QoIs. One nursery in California, one in
North Carolina, and another in Canada sprayed QoI fungicides 10, 8, or 6 times, respectively, during one season (Table 1). Among these applications, the nurseries indicated an alternation among azoxystrobin, pyraclostrobin, and the premix of pyraclostrobin + boscalid. With the isolate collection information (nursery of origin), the number of QoI sprays during the nursery phase and number of resistant isolates may be correlated (Table 1). The majority of plants harboring QoI-resistant isolates originated from nurseries whose spray programs exceeded the product’s recommendations, sug gesting that there may be a link between nursery spray program and frequency of resistance.Concluding Remarks
C. acutatum resistance to QoI fungicides has become a wide spread problem in American and Canadian strawberry nurseries and in fruit production fields. In this study, we present an ongoing program that monitors the sensitivity of C. acutatum from straw berry nurseries and production fields across the United States to azoxystrobin. Just as reported in Florida (Forcelini et al. 2016), lack of anthracnose control and high yield losses throughout the United
States during the 2015 to 2016 season could be associated with the emergence of C. acutatum QoI-resistant populations.
Nursery surveys confirmed the intensive use of QoI fungicides.
Single-site fungicides such as the QoIs have been frequently used in nurseries to control anthracnose and other diseases and to deliver symptom-free stock material. In addition to commercial products in which only azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin was present, premixtures containing QoI fungicides were also deployed. Thus, an increase in the selection rate for QoI-resistant populations has been observed as early as in the nursery phase. Because transplants produced in large nurseries are sold to smaller ones, plants may be exposed to multiple
QoI applications in each phase of propagation. Consequently, during the fruit production phase, growers are faced with the challenge of controlling anthracnose outbreaks while having limited effective chemical options available.
Multi and single-site fungicide alternatives effective for the control of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields are urgently needed. An antifungal antibiotic, natamycin, which is widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has shown significant anthracnose fruit rot control (Mertely et al.
2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional
Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery usage only. Reducing overlap of same modes of action used during the nursery and fruit production phases might help increase the life span of single-site fungicides with high risk of resistance. In addition, even though the multisite fungicides captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil have been available for many decades, they are still effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries, when flowers and fruit are not present, but our surveys indicated that it has been greatly underused in comparison with the newer single-site fungicides. Owing to their efficacy and low risk of resistance, the multisite fungicides should be the main stream of disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non chemical alternatives such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017) are currently being investigated and should serve as tools to manage diseases and to reduce the use of single-site fungicides.
Overall, our results suggest that C. acutatum resistance to QoI fungicides is becoming a widespread problem in strawberry nurseries, and resistant isolates are being disseminated to fruit production fields in different states. Instead of eradicating the in oculum present on transplants, the frequent QoI applications select for resistant populations. Consequently, asymptomatic transplants carrying resistant isolates may serve as the inoculum source that results in anthracnose outbreaks in production fields. This situation warrants immediate changes in anthracnose management programs, which should integrate nonchemical strategies with multisite and alternative single-site fungicides to limit selection and prevent the spread of QoI-resistant populations.TABLE 1
