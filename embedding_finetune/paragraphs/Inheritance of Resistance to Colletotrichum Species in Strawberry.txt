Abstract. Experiments were conducted to estimate the relative importance  of  additive       and dominance      genetic variances and  non-allelic  interactions      in the inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum spp. in strawberry (Fra garia × ananassa Duch.). Progeny of 40 parents crossed in a Comstock and Robinson Design II Mating scheme were inoculated with three isolates of C. fragariae and one isolate of C. acutatum. Disease development on each plant was rated visually.  Variance components were estimated and converted  to genetic variances.  Estimates of    were six to 10 times higher than those for      Within-family variance not accounted for by            equaled 35% and 38% of the total genetic variance in females and males, respectively, indicating probable epistatic effects. The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was bimodal in both experiments, suggesting major gene action. Narrow-sense heritability estimates were 0.37 and 0.26, and broad-sense heritability estimates were 0.87 and 0.85 for females and males, respectively. Narrow-sense heritability estimates are probably sufficient to produce gains from recurrent selection. Gains from selection of clonal value should be possible because of the high broad sense heritability estimates.
It appears feasible to establish a broad genetic-based population resistant to Colletotrichum spp. from which selections could be evaluated per se and/or recombined to produce improved populations.
Anthracnose crown rot, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae
Brooks, is probably the most limiting factor in strawberry pro duction in the Gulf-South states of the United States. Smith and
Black (1986) found that C. acutatum Simmonds caused a similar crown rot. The disease has revolutionized strawberry culture in the traditional Louisiana production region, causing growers to change cultivars and plant production method. Plants are now obtained from nurseries outside the Gulf South rather than being produced on the farms. The locally adapted ‘Tangi’ is no longer widely grown because it is not available from nurseries outside of Louisiana. ‘Chandler’ and other California cultivars currently grown because of their availability appear to be susceptible to common leaf spot (Mycosphaerella fragariae), gray mold fruit rot (Botytis cinerea), angular leaf spot (Xanthomonas fragar iae), and C. acutatum fruit rot when grown in Louisiana. 
We found no reports on the inheritance of resistance to C. fragariae in the literature. Such information is needed to deter mine the most efficient breeding methodology. A preliminary study (Expt. 1) was conducted in 1985 to determine the feasi bility of estimating genetic and environmental variances in a small population using the available C. fragariae isolates, in oculation technique, and disease severity scale (Smith and Black, 1987). Progenies from many parents with a broad genetic base were evaluated in 1988 (Expt. 2) to obtain better estimates of the relative importance of additive and dominance genetic var iances and non-allelic interactions in the inheritance of resis tance to C. fragariae in strawberry.Materials and Methods 
Genetic and environmental variance (small population) (Expt.
1). Six strawberry clones that varied in origin and reported re sponse to C. fragariae (Table 1) were designated randomly as three male and three female parents. Each female was crossed with each male parent to produce nine full-sib families. As many  for publication 15 Oct. 1990. The cost of publishing this paper was  in part by the payment of page charges. Under postal regulations, this erefore must be hereby marked advertisement solely to indicate this as 57 seedlings from each family were propagated by runners to produce four genetically identical plants from each seedling.
One of the four plants originating from a seedling was inocu lated with each of three C. fragariae isolates and one C. acu tatum isolate so that each isolate was tested on identical genotypes.
C. fragariae isolates CF-63, LA-1, and Fla-1 were among the most virulent isolates evaluated in a previous study and were isolated from strawberry plants in three states (Smith and Black, 1990). In the same study, Goff was the most virulent C. acu tatum isolate.
Inoculum of each isolate was prepared at 1.5 × 106 conidia/ ml concentration and sprayed on the plants to runoff (Smith and
Black, 1987). Plants were inoculated with C. fragariae isolate
CF-63 on 4 Dec., LA-1 on 12 Dec., and FLA-1 on 20 Dec. 1985, and C. acutatum isolate Goff on 21 Jan. 1986. The in oculated plants were incubated in an unlighted dew chamber at 31 ± 2C and 100% RH for 48 h and then returned to a green house held between 20 and 28C and a 16-h photoperiod. After 12 days, the disease severity of each plant was rated as follows: 0 = no disease symptom, 1 = fleck on petiole, 2 = lesions 3 to 10 mm long, 3 = lesions 11 to 20 mm long, 4 = lesions >20 mm long, 5 = youngest leaf wilted, and 6 = plant dead.
Environmental variance    was estimated as the within clone variance of 148 plants from 37 clones inoculated with isolate CF-63. Analyses of genetic variance were performed by general linear model procedures (SAS Institute, Inc., Cary, N.C.). Variance components were then estimated by standard methods (Hallaeur and Miranda, 1981) after which estimates of genetic variances were computed as follows (Comstock et al., 1958):
Within full-sib families        error –          = 4 (pooled           dominance              Within full-sib families not additive or dominance        – 2 (pooled                      and Total       = 2 (pool1ed  and              Narrow-sense heritability (h2) was es timated in the standard manner (Hallaeur and Miranda, 1981) using pooled            to compute the numerator.

 kansas, North Carolina, Louisiana, Mississippi, and Florida plus two cultivars (Table 2). The parents were randomly allocated to four sets of 10. Clones within each set were randomly des ignated as five males and five females that were crossed in a
Comstock and Robinson (1952) Design II mating scheme. One hundred percent success with each cross would have resulted in 25 full-sib families from each set. Because of either poor seed set or lack of germination, plants from 87 out of 100 possible families were available for evaluation. From 12 to 16 seedlings per family were vegetatively propagated by runners to obtain three genetically identical plants from each seedling.
One plant originating from each seedling was inoculated with
C. fragariae isolates CF-63 and MS-9 and C. acutatum isolate
Mil-1 so that each isolate was tested on identical genotypes.
Isolates CF-63 and MS-9 were chosen because they were morphologically distinct and appeared to differ in pathogenicity; isolate Mil-1 was chosen as representative of C. acutatum (Smith and Black, 1990). Inoculum preparation and inoculation method were the same as in Expt. 1. Plants were inoculated with isolates
CF-63 and Mil-1 from 27 May to 10 June and with isolate MS 9 from 3 to 14 June 1988, incubated in a dew chamber at 100%
RH and 31 ± 1C for 48 h, then returned to a greenhouse at ambient temperatures.
All plants were rated for disease severity 20 days after in oculation using the same scale as in Expt. 1. An estimate of       was obtained from 321 plants from 10 clones inoculated with isolates CF-63 and Mil-1 and treated similarly to the progenies.
Genetic variances were estimated in the same manner as in Expt. J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 116(4):724-727. 1991.
1. Narrow (h2) and broad (H2) sense heritability estimates were computed by standard methods (Hallaeur and Miranda, 1981).Results 
Expt. 1. The mean disease severity rating for isolate Goff (2.5) was significantly lower than that for CF-63 (3.7), Fla-1 (3.7), or La-1 (3.3), indicating that C. acutatum produced less severe disease reaction than C. fragariae. Despite this differ ence, genetic response to the two pathogen species appears sim ilar as indicated by a lack of genotype × isolate interactions (Table 3). Isolates were pooled to estimate genetic parameters because neither the male nor female × isolate source of vari ation was significant.
The additive genetic variance estimate (0.39) was more than four times larger than that for dominance (0.09). Within-family variance not accounted for by additive or dominance estimates (0.39) equaled 45% of the total genetic variance (0.86). The narrow-sense heritability estimate of 0.89 was very high.
Expt. 2. The mean disease severity rating of C. acutatum isolate Mil-1 (2.8) was again significantly lower than ratings of
C. fragariae isolates MS-9 (3.4) and CF-63 (3.2). Neither the male nor female × isolate source of variation was significant (Table 4), which agrees with the results of Expt. 1. Isolates were pooled to estimate genetic parameters.
Estimates of genetic variances were computed for both male and female components because the data were unbalanced due to missing families and unequal numbers of progeny per family.
Nevertheless, male and female estimates were similar in each 725

instance        = 0.10 and 0.17,       = 0.67 and 0.63, and        1.77 and 1.80, respectively). Within-family variance not ac counted for by            equaled 35% and 38% of the total genetic variance in females and males, respectively. In contrast to Expt. 1, the estimate of dominance     = 1.00) was consid erably higher than that for       A moderate level of h2 (0.26 for male and 0.37 for female) was estimated for resistance to three isolates of C. fragariae. Broad-sense heritability estimates (0.85 for male and 0.87 for female), however, were very high.Discussion 
A difference between the mean disease severity rating of C. acutatum and C. fragariae in both experiments confirmed pre vious results (Smith and Black, 1990) that C. acutatum produces less severe plant disease reaction than does C. fragariae. Col letotrichum acutatum is occasionally isolated from the crown of dying plants in the field, but it remains primarily a fruit rot organism with the capability to cause crown rot.
The lack of significant genotype × isolate variance in both experiments suggested a similar genetic response to C. fragariae and C. acutatum, which agrees with the results of Smith and
Black (1990) who found that most cultivars responded similarly to the two pathogen species. A similar response to each C. fragariae isolate used was also indicated, but this may not be true for all isolates because Smith and Black (1990) found sig nificant isolate × cultivar interactions when other isolates were used. The Colletotrichum spp. and race in question should prob ably be identified before initiating a breeding program, even though no genotype × isolate interaction was indicated in this study.
The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was 726 bimodal in both experiments (Fig. 1), suggesting major gene action. The large amount of within-family variance not ac counted for by         probably indicates epistatic effects.
Underestimation of     could inflate   but its similar estimates of 1.33 and 1.61 using different genotypes and isolates in dif ferent years do not suggest such a bias. Wright (1956) hypoth esized that large epistatic effects would be expected when biparental crosses are made in species that are normally prop agated asexually. Epistatic variance was important for various commercial traits in studies of Comstock et al. (1958), Hansche et al. (1968), Watkins and Spangelo (1968), Watkins et al.
(1970), and Spangelo et al. (1971), suggesting that it is a general phenomenon in strawberry. Epistatic effects are important, but those postulated in this study occurred within families and should not affect other variances computed from among-family com parisons (Shaw et al., 1989).
The validity of other assumptions under which additive and dominance variances are estimated appears reasonable to accept although some are uncertain: 1) Regular diploid behavior of octoploid strawberry at meiosis was found by Powers (1944) and Arulsekar et al. (1981). 2) The presence of minimal cyto plasmic or other maternal effects was supported by the fact that    was relatively large but it would have been underestimated if such effects were considerable (Comstock et al., 1958).
3) Assumption of no correlation of genotypes at different loci may not be tenable in Expt. 1 but probably is in Expt. 2 because the parents constitute broadly based germplasm. The parents were related in some instances; nevertheless, they represent a random sample of the population of interest.
The high proportion of dominance variance in Expt. 2 com pared with Expt. 1 may be accounted for by the broad-based, more representative strawberry population sample in the former.
These results illustrate the possible erroneous conclusions caused by using too few parents. Assuming epistasis is important in resistance to Colletotrichum spp., it could inflate   estimates (Hallaeur and Miranda, 1981). Nevertheless, gains from selec tion of clonal value should be possible because of the high estimate of broad-sense heritability. The high proportion of total genetic variance estimated to consist of epistatic variance sug

 gests that a multistage selection/breeding procedure would be efficient. Within-family selection would permit introgression of new germplasm to introduce desirable characteristics and reduce inbreeding. Establishing a broad genetic-based population re sistant to Colletotrichum spp. from which selections could be evaluated per se (using broad-sense heritability) and/or recom bined to produce improved populations also appears feasible.
Narrow-sense heritabilitv estimates based on this study are prob ably sufficient to produce moderate gains from recurrent selec tion. This conclusion is supported by the fact that we have observed increased levels of resistance with successive cycles of selection following phenotypic assortative mating (B.J.S., unpublished data).Literature Cited
