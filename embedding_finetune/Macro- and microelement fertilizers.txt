Abstract. Host nutritional variables were evaluated for their effects on the severity of crown and root rot of tomato caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici. Tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) seedlings (cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen infested, soilless rockwool system in the greenhouse and were fertilized with a nutrient solution that was amended with macro- and microelements at various rates. Disease was evaluated after 2 weeks using an index of 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured.
Regression analysis indicated that disease severity was significantly increased by ammo nium-nitrogen [NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4], NaH2PO4·H2O, Fe-EDDHA, MnSO4,
MoO3, and ZnSO4·7H2O. Disease severity was reduced by nitrate-nitrogen [Ca(NO3)2·4H2O] and CuSO4·H2O. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg·L–1 N) reduced disease, but rates above 100 mg·L–1 N increased it. Disease was not affected by MgSO4·7H2O. In all cases, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity. Mineral fertilizers had no effect on nutrient solution pH. This information sheds new light on environmental factors that influence plant–pathogen interactions, and may be applied to develop a management strategy for Fusarium crown and root rot based on host nutrition.
Jarvis and Thorpe, 1981), but is technically impractical in hydroponic production systems.
Alternative control measures are needed, ide ally with the aim of developing an integrated disease management strategy.
The nutritional status of a plant has a major impact on disease susceptibility, and this has been exploited for suppressing a variety of diseases (Engelhard, 1989). Notable examples are Fusarium wilts caused by F. oxysporum formae speciali, with reports dating to the 1920s that describe the beneficial effect of lime amendments (Jones et al., 1989). Since then, the effects of most major and minor nutrients on wilt diseases have been studied.
Jones and coworkers (Jones et al., 1989) ap plied this information to develop an effective fertilizer-based management strategy for
Fusarium wilt of tomato that is used in com mercial production systems in the United
States. Similar approaches have been success ful for control of Fusarium wilts of other vegetable and ornamental crops (Elmer, 1992;
Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985).
In contrast, little is currently known about the influence of plant nutrition on crown and root rot of tomato. Previous studies tested single concentrations of nitrogenous fertilizers and sodium chloride (Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980;
Woltz et al., 1992), and did not examine the influence of other potentially critical mineral nutrients, particularly microelements. The objective of our study was to compare the effects of several macro- and microelements (various ammonium-N sources, nitrate-N, sodium phosphate, iron, molybdenum, and copper-, magnesium-, manganese-, and zinc sulfates) on disease severity and growth of tomato seedlings. Mineral nutrients were tested across a range of concentrations to provide more information that can be applied to develop a fertilizer-based management strategy and for integrating mineral fertilizers with other control approaches (e.g., biocontrol) that may be sensitive to mineral levels.Materials and Methods 
The influence of various mineral nutrients on Fusarium crown and root rot was evaluated in a noncirculating hydroponics system.
Pregerminated [2–3 d on 0.85% water agar (Oxoid, Hampshire, England) at 24 °C; 2–4 mm-long primary root] tomato seeds cv.
Bonnie Best were planted on rockwool cubes (3.5 cm2 diameter × 4 cm deep; one seed per cube; Grodania A/S, Hedehusene, Denmark) in square plastic trays (5.5 cm deep). The rockwool was saturated with 800 mL of dilute (1/4 strength) Knop nutrient solution (Ziegler, 1983) containing (mg·L–1): Ca(NO3)2·4H2O (250); KH2PO4, KCl, and MgSO4·7H2O (62.5 each); and Fe-EDDHA [ethylenediamine-di(o hydroxyphenyl-acetic acid); Sequestrene 138
Fe, Novartis AG, Basel, Switzerland] (5).
Autoclave-sterilized stock solutions of the various minerals tested [Ca(NO3)2·4H2O,

NaH4PO4·H2O, NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24·4H2O,

Crown and root rot of tomato (also referred to as foot and root rot) caused by Fusarium oxysporum Schlechtend.:Fr. f.sp. radicis lycopersici Jarvis & Shoemaker was first de scribed in Japan in the late 1970s, and has since become an economically important prob lem in greenhouse tomato production through out Europe, North America, Japan, and Israel (Jarvis, 1988). It is considered the most de structive tomato disease caused by a non zoosporic pathogen in soilless hydroponics production systems, where reductions in mar ketable yield can exceed 60% (Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990; Stanghellini and Rasmussen, 1994). Tomato plants can be infected at any time, but losses are especially severe when infection occurs at the seedling stage. Symp toms include dark brown necrotic lesions that form on the roots and crown region and may extend up the hypocotyl, stem, and foliage; localized discoloration of the vascular tissues; and subsequent leaf chlorosis, wilting, and death. The pathogen is spread via infected transplants, which often carry latent infec tions. It can then grow to some extent through soil to infect adjacent plants (Hartman and
Fletcher, 1991; Louter and Edgington, 1990).
The threat to tomato production is further increased by infection from airborne conidia that are produced in stem lesions and are dispersed by wind and fungus gnats [Bradysia sp. (Diptera: Sciaridae)] (Gillespie and
Menzies, 1993; Rowe and Farley, 1981).
Control of Fusarium crown and root rot on tomato has been difficult and will probably require multiple approaches. Only a few resis tant cultivars are available (Erb and Rowe, 1992; Heremans, 1996; Sugahara and Sakurai, 1991). Fungicides, including benomyl, captafol, imazalil, thiram, and prochloraz-Mn, provide inconsistent control, leave problem atic residues in edible tissues, and are often phytotoxic even when applied at recommended rates, especially on seedlings (Hartman and
Fletcher, 1991; Jarvis, 1988, 1992; Mihuta
Grimm et al., 1990). Biological control utiliz ing fungal (i.e., Trichoderma harzianum and nonpathogenic Fusarium oxysporum and F. solani) and bacterial agents (i.e., Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas sp.) typically pro vides only a moderate level of disease sup pression in the greenhouse and field (Bochow et al., 1996; Duffy and Défago, 1997; Hartman and Fletcher, 1991; Louter and Edgington, 1990; M’Piga et al., 1997; Sivan et al., 1987).
Allelopathy from lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and dandelion (Taraxacum Weber sect.
ruderalia sp. Kirschner) residues incorporated into soil provides limited control (Jarvis, 1992;

PLANT PATHOLOGY give a range of final concentrations (see Figs. 1–5) and the pH was measured with a Digital meter (Auer Bittmann Soulié AG, Zürich,
Switzerland). Prior to saturating the rockwool, the nutrient solution was inoculated with F. oxysporum to give ≈105 microconidia plus mycelial fragments per mL, as previously de scribed (Duffy and Défago, 1997). Mycelial fragments were included because in prelimi nary experiments, inoculation with micro conidia alone resulted in little or no disease.
Inoculum was produced by growing the patho gen in 150 mL of 2% malt extract broth (pH 5.5; Oxoid) in 500-mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks at 24 °C for 5–7 d with shaking at 130 rpm. Cultures were centrifuged (15 min at 2200 gn) to collect fungal biomass, which was then briefly homogenized in an electric blender immediately before adding to the nutrient so lution.
Plants were grown in a growth chamber in the greenhouse with 16 h light/8 h darkness, 22 °C day/18 °C night, and 70% relative humid ity. Lower temperatures are favorable for de velopment of crown and root rot, in contrast with the warmer temperatures (≈28 °C) that favor Fusarium wilt (Jones et al., 1991).
Millipore-filtered bi-distilled water (0.05 µm,
Elgastat Ultra High Polishing unit, O. Kleiner
AG, Wohlen, Switzerland) was added as needed to maintain a solution level of 1 to 2 cm. Fourteen days after planting, tomato seed lings were carefully removed from the rockwool with the upper 1.5 cm of the root system attached. They were weighed and dis ease severity was rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (adapted from Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990) where 0 = symptomless; 1 = slight brown discoloration of the upper root system; 2 = moderate brown discoloration of two-thirds or less of the upper root system; 3 = extreme brown discoloration of the upper root system and numerous necrotic lesions extending up the crown and stem; and 4 = seedling dead or nearly so. Representative samples of necrotic tissue were plated onto Komada’s selective medium (Komada, 1975) to confirm F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici as the cause of symptoms.
Mineral nutrient treatments were used at seven rates, each consisting of three replicates over time with 12 to 20 plants per replicate, and were arranged in a completely random ized design. Data for each mineral nutrient treatment were analyzed separately. Relation ships between nutrient rate and disease sever ity and plant weight were evaluated using regression procedures (SAS Institute, Cary,
N.C.). Adjusted regression coefficients, which stabilize to a certain value when an adequate set of variables is included in the model, were derived as an alternative to r2, which can be driven to 1 by adding superfluous variables to the model with no real improvement of fit (Littell et al., 1991).Results and Discussion 
Twelve mineral nutrients were tested sepa rately for their influence on Fusarium crown and root rot. A similar and moderate level of

 crotic lesions forming at the crown generally within a week of emergence. This was often followed by severe chlorosis and turgor loss.
No signs of vascular infection were observed beyond the area of superficial necrosis. Severe disease (1–2 rating on a scale of 4) developed in all control treatments that were provided with the standard nutrient solution (no addi tional minerals) (Figs. 1–4). Disease devel oped rapidly in affected seedlings, with ne 289HORTSCIENCE, VOL. 34(2), APRIL 1999 disease developed (mean rating 3–4) in treat ments provided with ammonium-N (Fig. 1), phosphate (Fig. 3), iron, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum (Fig. 4). At the higher concen trations tested, infected seedlings often failed to emerge. Seedlings with no symptoms after 10 d usually remained healthy even when left to mature (data not shown), probably because of poor spread of the pathogen in rockwool (Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990). In all treatments, fresh weight of seedlings was inversely corre lated with the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot (Figs. 1–5), supporting previous ob servations for this disease (Duffy and Défago, 1997; Jones et al., 1991; Woltz et al., 1992).
Windborne and insect-transmitted spores were not a factor in this study, because noninoculated plants that were placed in the greenhouse (but not included in the experiments) remained disease-free.
Nitrogen form had a major influence on the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and on growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concen trations of nitrate-N reduced disease and im proved plant growth in comparison with am monium forms. Ammonium sulfate and am monium chloride gave similar responses, im plicating NH4 + as the deleterious component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no influence on Fusarium dis eases or to increase disease just as ammonium
N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, by testing a range of concentra tions we were able to observe that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg·L–1 N), ammo nium nitrate reduced disease in a fashion simi lar to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4 + ion became evident at concentrations above 125 mg·L–1 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seed lings may have had insufficient available car bohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), to nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973).
Nitrates have long been recognized for reducing seedling disease caused by Rhizocto nia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); how ever, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta
Grimm et al. (1990) reported that nitrogen supplied as a 20N–20P–20K fertilizer had no effect on growth of F. oxysporum f.sp.
radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to nonfertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (total
N applied was not specified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to negate potential pH effects. Indeed, a differen tial effect of nitrogen form on pH is a major mechanism of action for suppression of many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974).
In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported that nitrate- vs. ammonium-N (each at 225 mg·L–1 
N) reduced severity of crown and root rot without affecting soil pH (pH 4.81 and 4.85, respectively). Similarly, we observed no ef fect of nitrogen fertilization (or any other min eral amendment) on pH of the hydroponic solution. In both studies, though, only pH of

PLANT PATHOLOGY the bulk media was measured and possible localized pH effects in the rhizosphere where disease actually occurs cannot be excluded (Smiley, 1975). Another possible factor may be total calcium concentrations, which are increased with liming and with calcium ni trates as used in our study and that of Woltz et al. (1992). They found that all treatments that increased calcium content also reduced dis ease. While adequate calcium in tomato tis sues appears to be important for resistance to cell-wall-degrading enzymes (e.g., polygalac turanose) produced by Fusarium sp., it is gen erally considered a minor factor in controlling disease (Jones et al., 1989).
Sodium phosphate increased disease se verity and reduced tomato growth (Fig. 3).
Similar results with various phosphorus forms have been reported for wilt diseases caused by related formae speciali (Jones et al., 1989), and this has been attributed in part to the enhanced uptake of calcium (Jarvis, 1992).
While possible effects of sodium cannot be excluded, exhaustive studies with other
Fusarium diseases [i.e., celery yellows (Schneider, 1985) and asparagus wilt (Elmer, 1992, 1995)] revealed no influence of the Na2+ ion. Magnesium sulfate fertilization had abso lutely no effect on Fusarium crown and root rot at concentrations up to 250 mg·L–1 Mg (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first examination of magnesium on F. oxysporum independent of the Cl2+ ion. Previous work has demonstrated that fertilization with MgCl2 increased wilt caused by F. oxysporum formae speciali on tomato (Jones et al., 1989) and celery (Schneider, 1985). In these studies, Cl2+ and not Mg2+ was suspected to be the problem atic ion, a conclusion that is further supported by our results.
Copper sulfate effectively reduced disease severity (Fig. 4) and improved tomato growth (Fig. 5) at concentrations above 20 mg·L–1 Cu. This is not surprising, considering the histori cal use of Cu2+ as a broad-spectrum fungicide (Schumann, 1991). No phytotoxicity was ob served, even at the highest concentrations tested. In contrast, all other micronutrients tested aggravated disease (Fig. 4) and stunted growth (Fig. 5). Zinc and manganese increased disease at concentrations above 40 and 50 mg·L–1, respectively. Molybdenum increased disease at concentrations of 20 mg·L–1 and above. Ammonium molybdate (Fig. 4E) was more conducive to disease than molybdenum oxide (Fig. 4D), perhaps because of the addi tive influence of the NH4 + ions. Iron added as
Fe-EDDHA increased disease at concentra tions of just 5 mg·L–1 and greater, with only slight further increases until over 80 mg·L–1 (Fig. 4F). We found no evidence for induction of host defenses by zinc, iron, or manganese, as suggested by Mandal and Sinha (1992).
Plants supplied with zinc or ammonium mo lybdate at 33 mg·L–1 exhibited no signs of toxicity in the absence of the pathogen (Duffy and Défago, 1997). However, node length declined with higher concentrations, suggest ing that phytotoxicity as well as increased disease possibly contributed to reductions in fresh weight (Fig. 5). While excessive concen trations are uncommon in agricultural soils and hydroponics, their availability can be in creased under certain conditions, such as acidi fication. Incidentally, acidic pH also favors crown and root rot (Woltz et al., 1992). Inert materials such as rockwool tend to reduce plant sensitivity to minerals (Jarvis, 1992).
Plants may also be exposed to elevated min eral concentrations applied to improve the beneficial activity of biological control strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Duffy and
Défago, 1997). Results of our study facilitate the development of such microbe–mineral fer tilizer treatments with minimal adverse side effects on the host plant, information that has been lacking. They also accentuate the need to develop methods for more efficient delivery of potentially phytotoxic minerals.
Exactly how mineral nutrients influence disease is uncertain, but effects on pathogen activity and host susceptibility are probably involved. Fusarium oxysporum has a rela tively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above those typically found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and Défago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and
Défago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases the sensitivity of tomato to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by
Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983).
Susceptibility of tomato to fungal attack is increased by zinc, in part because zinc raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992).
Host susceptibility can also be altered by inter actions between minerals, particularly at el evated concentrations, which impact the avail ability of other nutrients. For example, ammo nium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chlo ride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomato to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with min erals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic mi croorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be exploited to improve the beneficial activity of intro duced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and Défago, 1997).
Our results build on those of Woltz et al.
(1992) and provide a foundation for develop ing a control strategy based on plant nutrition.
Such an approach has been successfully ap plied to manage other Fusarium diseases (Jarvis, 1992; Jones et al., 1989). Mineral nutrient effects on crown and root rot of to mato caused by F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis lycospersici were similar to those reported for other formae speciali, which reflects the adapt ability of control strategies for various
Fusarium diseases. It further suggests biologi cal similarity of these pathogens and/or simi lar responses of diverse hosts to these fungi.
Fusarium crown and root rot, however, is not the only problem threatening hydroponically grown tomato, and nontarget effects of certain mineral nutrients on other diseases need to be considered. A prominent example, nitrate-N, which reduced crown and root rot, increases the severity of economically devastating dis eases caused by Pythium and phytopathogenic bacteria (Stanghellini and Rasmussen, 1994).
Integrating mineral nutrients with newly de veloped resistant cultivars, biocontrol agents, and/or fungicides used at reduced, nonphyto toxic concentrations may enhance the level and spectrum of disease control.Literature Cited
