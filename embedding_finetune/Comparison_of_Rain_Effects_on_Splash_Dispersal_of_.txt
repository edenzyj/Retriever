In Cameroon, arabica coffee is grown on small family farms in the western high lands (1,000 to 2,000 m). The climate in the region is characterized by a 4- to 5 month dry season (November to March) and a monomodal rainy season lasting 7 to 8 months (March to October). That cli mate, which is typical of tropical high altitude regions, is favorable to synchro nous flowering of plants triggered by the first rainy spells, in mid-March. Fruit development takes place over a season lasting 6 to 7 months. Coffee berry dis ease (CBD), caused by Colletotrichum kahawae Waller & Bridge, is the main cause of yield loss in arabica coffee in the 
Cameroon. After harvesting, at the begin ning of the dry season, the absence of berries for a period of 5 months raises questions about pathogen survival and the means by which epidemics begin. With out fungicide applications, losses caused to C. kahawae can reach 90% on some small holdings at high altitudes (>1,600 m) (7). 
Epidemics caused by fungi of the genus 
Colletotrichum occur frequently on peren nial crops in the tropics. Epidemics may be caused by ubiquitous pathogens, such as C. gloeosporioides on mango (3,13,14), or by what is now C. acutatum on citrus (11), in which the pathogen can attack several aerial tissues of those species. For those diseases, tissues susceptible to the patho gen are present throughout the year on the host plant. For other diseases, the pathogen attacks the host only during a certain stage of its development, and epidemics develop over a short period of the plant’s annual cycle. One such pathosystem is coffee berry disease (CBD) caused by Colleto trichum kahawae Waller & Bridge sp. nov. (33). As with other species of Colleto trichum, conidia are produced in acervuli and appear as an orange-colored, muci laginous mass. Flower buds, branch bark, and mummified berries are considered to be potential sources of primary inoculum (21,24,29). At the start of the rainy season (March to October), C. kahawae resumes its parasitic activity, infecting young fruit (the “pin head” stage) 4 to 6 weeks post flowering. The first symptoms are detected typically on 8- to 10-week-old fruits and appear as dark, sunken lesions that can expand and coalesce to affect the entire fruit. Some infected berries remain at tached to branches and serve as a secon dary source of inoculum. Several pathogen development cycles may occur up to the 25th week of fruit development, when berries develop ontogenic resistance, coin ciding with the beginning of fruit endocarp hardening (21,29). 
CBD severity is highly dependent upon climatic factors, particularly temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Rain is necessary for the dispersal of conidia of Colleto trichum spp. (16,18,23). Optimum tem peratures for conidium germination and mycelium growth are 20 to 22°C for C. kahawae on coffee (21,29). Appressorium formation occurs at the same temperatures and at relative humidity approaching 100% (6,12,17). Climatic conditions conducive to C. kahawae typically occur at high ele vations (>1,600 m); disease incidence is minimal below 1,000 m. Agricultural prac tices may also influence disease severity (19,26). 
Currently, CBD is managed through host resistance (8), cultural practices, and chemical control (21). However, these management practices could be used more efficiently as part of an IPM strategy that can be applied by producers of arabica coffee. Such an approach requires prior knowledge of the host/parasite/environ ment interactions that govern disease de velopment. We therefore carried out spa tio-temporal monitoring of the disease, in order to gain a clearer understanding of how epidemics developed in a high altitude region with high disease pressure. The study was undertaken at two sites with contrasting agro-ecological conditions. 
The spatial dynamics of the disease within plots were analyzed and the type of disper sal was identified to help optimize control methods. MATERIALS AND METHODS 
Characterization of plots. Studies to examine the spatio-temporal effects of 
CBD were conducted at two locations in the Cameroon, Bafou (05°33.540N, 10°04.520E, 1,820 m elevation) and Santa (05°47.190N, 10°09.672E, 1,750 m eleva tion). At each site, a uniform plot grown without shade and without intercrops was chosen. The plots, measuring approxi mately 1,000 m2, contained 58 coffee trees at Santa and 67 at Bafou. Each coffee tree was identified spatially by its coordinates and an identification number. The coffee ABSTRACT 
Mouen Bedimo, J. A., Bieysse, D., Cilas, C., and Nottéghem, J. L. 2007. Spatio-temporal dy namics of arabica coffee berry disease caused by Colletotrichum kahawae on a plot scale. Plant Dis. 91:1229-1236. 
Coffee berry disease (CBD) is caused by Colletotrichum kahawae. This pathogen only attacks green berries; it causes cherry rot and premature fruit fall. The disease leads to major harvest losses in the western highland region of Cameroon. The origin of the primary inoculum and the beginning of epidemics are unknown. The interactions between the pathogen and its host were studied at locations where CBD was known to cause severe disease. The disease was monitored weekly in uniform plots of adjacent coffee trees at Santa (1,750 m) in 2003 and 2004 and Bafou (1,820 m) in 2004 and 2005. The logistic model provided good fit of the epidemic’s temporal dynamics. The spatial distribution of CBD over time indicated that plants in a plot were con taminated stepwise from the first infected coffee tree. An analysis of semi-variograms and the disease dispersal maps obtained by kriging revealed primary infection foci at both sites. They were observed from the 8th to the 10th week after flowering at Bafou and from the 11th to the 13th week at Santa. CBD affected the entire plots 3 weeks after the foci first appeared. These results suggest that inoculum from previous epidemics survives at points in the initial foci in a coffee plantation.

At Bafou, the trees were around 20 years old with a single stem and were pruned to a pyramid. Coffee plants at both locations were of the cultivar Jamaica, which is highly susceptible to CBD. The coffee trees were spaced 3 × 2.5 m apart and were maintained by pruning to remove dead branches, suckers, and mummified berries. 
They were fertilized after each fruit-set with mineral fertilizer (N-P-K: 20-10-10, 
ADER-Cameroon) at a rate of 200 g per plant. Two annual applications of gly phosate (Round-Up; Monsanto) at 2.4 liters/ha were made to control weeds. This study was conducted on the same trees for two consecutive years: from 2003 to 2004 at Santa and from 2004 to 2005 at Bafou. 
Assessment of disease incidence and losses. Three plagiotropic branches, lo cated in the upper, middle, and lower sec tions of the coffee trees, were marked at the pin head stage. The following data were obtained on each branch: (i) total number of berries, (ii) number of new diseased berries, and (iii) number of old diseased berries. Each new diseased berry was marked with a label to avoid duplicate counts in subsequent weeks. Each year, the observations were systematically started from the 6th week after flowering, and ended around the 25th week. For weekly assessment, the cumulative percentage of diseased berries (Pdis) per tree was deter mined as: 100 1 25 1 ×= ∑ = TotB Ndb
Pdis n n  where (Ndbn) = the sum of diseased new berries from the first to the nth observa tion, and TotB1 = the total number of ber ries counted on the first observation. 
Daily rainfall was recorded during the entire experimental period in each site. 
These were used to compute weekly cumu lative rainfall. 
Statistical analyses. The general linear model (GLM) was used to carry out an analysis of variance to determine the effect of berry position on the trees (upper, mid dle, and lower sections) on the percentage of diseased berries at the end of each year. 
For this analysis, each coffee tree was considered as an experimental unit; the number of replicates thus corresponded to the number of individuals in the plot (58 at 
Santa and 67 at Bafou). All data underwent arcsine√x transformation to normalize the variance. Descriptive maps of spatial dis tribution of the disease were also produced from the cumulated percentages of dis eased berries over time. 
Temporal analysis. Disease progression over time was examined by modeling data with nonlinear regressions of the polyno mial, sigmoidal, and miscellaneous model families. The best possible curve fit was then selected based on standard errors (S) and correlation coefficients (R2). The logis tic regressions of the sigmoidal family model were defined by the formula: Y = 
K/[1 + Bexp(–rt)], with Y and t, respec tively, representing the cumulated percent age of infected berries and the number of weeks after flowering. The coefficients K, r, and B, respectively, represented the maximum disease level, the rate parameter, and the constant term of the model. The rate of change of disease level Y at time t was determined using the derivative Y′(t) = [rKBexp(–rt)]/[(1 + Bexp(–rt)]2 in which B = (K – Y0)/Y0, Y0 being the initial disease level (20). The duration of the exponential period and the maximum rate of disease spread were determined by the formulas used for cocoa pod growth modeling by 
Berry and Cilas (5): Kr/4 for the maximum rate of disease spread and ln(B)/r for its exponential phase. 
Spatial analysis. Spatial correlations be tween coffee trees were determined by analyzing semi-variograms, the principle of which is to measure the variability exist ing on average between the points zi and zi+h lying h apart inside a plot. Statistically, semivariance is an autocorrelation defined by the function: 
ϒ(h) = [1/2N(h)] ∑[zi – zi+h]2 where ϒ(h), the semivariance for interval distance class h, is half the average of the sum of square differences between the percentage of infected berries for N sample pairs of trees, with the lag interval h. zi is the percentage of infected berries meas ured for sample trees at point i, and zi+h is the percentage measured for sample trees at point i+h. The variogram is a model for average semivariances of all possible in terval classes plotted against their corre sponding lag distances. The data were auto-fitted to the exponential, spherical, and Gaussian isotropic model variograms to analyze the multidirectional spatial de pendence between coffee trees. These models are described by three parameters: (i) the separation distance or the range (A) over which the spatial dependence is ap parent, (ii) the y-intercept of the model or the nugget variance (C0), which indicates the discontinuity of the variogram at lag zero, and (iii) the sill (C + C0), which is the model asymptote. The residual sums of squares (RSS), the R2 coefficient, and the proportion of C/(C0 + C) are the statistics mainly used for interpreting the validity of the variogram model (Geostatistics for the 
Environmental Sciences. Gamma Design 
Software, LLC, Plainwell, MI, USA). The 
RSS provides an exact measure of how well the model fits the variogram data; the lower the reduced sums of squares, the better the model fits. The R2 coefficient provides an indication of how well the model fits the variogram data, but it is not as sensitive or robust as RSS for best-fit calculations. The proportion of C/(C0 + C) provides a measure of the proportion of sample variance (C0 + C) that is explained by spatially structured variance C. This value will be 1 for a variogram with no nugget variance (where the curve passes through the origin). It will be 0 where there is no spatially dependent variation at the range specified. C0 (the nugget vari ance) is the y-intercept of the model, and 
C0 + C (the sill) is the model asymptote. 
Kriging analysis was used to localize foci on the experimental plot. Kriging is a nearest-neighbor interpolation technique in which the estimated disease level at a given tree location is a weighted moving average of best estimates to minimize local area variance (Geostatistics for the Envi ronmental Sciences). It is the best linear unbiased estimator based on prior selection of a variogram. Kriging can only be per formed for variograms showing spatial dependence between trees. 
The analysis of variance and the de scriptive maps of disease spatial distribu tion were carried out with SAS software (Version 9.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, 
NC). The analysis of nonlinear regressions was carried out with CurveExpert software (D. Hyams, Starkville, MS, USA). Semi variogram and kriging analyses were car ried out with GS+ (Gamma Design Soft ware). RESULTS 
Incidence of CBD depending on branch position on the coffee tree. The total number of berries differed each year, irrespective of the site. It was relatively high in 2004 at both sites, with an average of 48 berries per branch at Bafou and 66 berries at Santa. The initial number of berries was small in 2003 at Santa and in 2005 at Bafou (Table 1). 
At Santa, the percentage of infected ber ries was estimated to be around 40% in each of the two study years (Fig. 1A and 
B). However, at Bafou, CBD incidence varied significantly (P < 0.0001) from one year to the next. It was estimated at around 30% of diseased berries in 2004 and 20% in 2005 (Fig. 1C and D). There were no differences between coffee tree branches at 
Santa (Table 1), but a significant interac tion between coffee tree branches and production years at Bafou. In 2004, the highest incidence was found in the upper branches. Disease rates were constant on all the branches in 2005 (Table 1). 
Spatio-temporal dynamics of the dis ease. Temporal dynamics. The best fits for temporal disease spread were obtained with the logistic and Morgan-Mercer
Flodin (MMF) models, both belonging to the sigmoidal model family (Table 2). The logistic model was the most suitable to explain the temporal disease spread at both sites, although the 2004 data were well fitted by the MMF model at Santa (Table 2). At Santa, the infection spread rapidly between the 10th and 20th weeks after flowering (Fig. 1A and B). The maximum 
Plant Disease / October 2007 1231 rate of disease spread was estimated at around 6% (diseased new berries per week) in 2003 and 5% in 2004 (Table 3). The rate of spread was slower at Bafou, with around 4% in 2004 and 3% in 2005. The duration of the disease exponential phase was esti mated at 13 to 15 weeks at Santa; and be tween 10 and 13 weeks at Bafou. In 2004, the rainfall received during the period of exponential disease spread was higher at Santa than at Bafou (Fig. 2). 
The cumulative percentage of berries in fected during the asymptotic phase of the disease was higher and more stable at 
Santa than at Bafou, whatever the year. At 
Santa, this disease period was observed around the 20th week in 2003 and around the 25th week in 2004 (Fig. 1A and B). At 
Bafou, it occurred around the 20th week for both years (Fig. 1C and D). 
Spatial dynamics at different stages of the epidemic. At the start of the epidemic, symptoms were observed on trees that were either isolated or in small clusters (Fig. 3A and B). Semi-variogram analysis indicated an isotropic type of distribution, indicating that CBD did not spread in a preferential direction. In 2003 at Santa and 2004 at Bafou, semi-variogram analysis revealed a pure nugget effect (no spatial dependency between the coffee trees) at the start of the disease, and beyond the 10th and 13th week at Bafou and Santa, respectively (Table 4). Spatial correlation among infected coffee trees was observed between the 8th and 10th weeks at Bafou, and the 11th and 13th weeks at Santa. For both sites, the range decreased over time and the sill increased. The range varied from 2.64 to 3.6 m at Santa, meaning that the spatial dependence can only be ob served between immediate neighboring trees. The biggest range at Bafou was 8.37 m, indicating spatial correlations up to three trees away. The first two semi variograms were spherical at Santa (Fig. 4A and B), and the last one was Gaussian (Fig. 4C). At Bafou, all of them were 
Gaussian (Fig. 5A to C). These curves showed that CBD spread was stepwise at 
Santa; in contrast, the disease could spread to coffee trees that were more than two units away at Bafou. However, an analysis of the data obtained at Santa revealed large residual errors (RSS) and weak coeffi cients of determination (R2). On the other hand, it revealed very small residual errors

In the second year of observations (2004 at Santa and 2005 at Bafou), the infection foci were not detected at Santa, unlike at 
Bafou, where they were observed from the 10th to the 24th week. However, the foci obtained at Bafou in 2005 were dependent on experimental bias caused by around 10 coffee trees without berries. At that site, the semi-variogram displayed morphologi cal diversity over time. It was exponential in the 10th week, with strong discontinuity at the origin (Fig. 5D), thereby suggesting the existence of considerable irregularity in infection levels at the time the first symp toms appeared. It was Gaussian between the 11th and 24th week (Fig. 5E and F). At 
Santa, the infection foci were only ob served in 2003, as shown on the maps in 
Figure 6. They were obtained every year at 
Bafou (Fig. 7). Over the two successive years of observations, a focus located at the same spot was detected at that site (Fig. 7A and D). DISCUSSION 
In several countries where CBD exists, it has been reported that infection severity increases with the height above sea level, as 
CBD is favored by cooler temperatures (16,21,26). However, in our study, disease development was less at the higher altitude site. It is likely that the variation in severity came from the different rainfall at the two sites. In fact, in pathosystems where patho gen propagation mostly occurs through splashing, rainfall intensity ensures good dispersal of inoculum on the host plant, such as is the case with Gibberella zeae on wheat (25) or Botryosphaeria dothidea on pistachio (2). At Santa, CBD severity was uniform on all coffee tree branches, irre spective of the observation year. On the other hand, at Bafou in 2004, coffee tree branches were attacked in line with an as cending severity gradient. Conidia were generally dispersed from the top to the bot tom of the trees (1,32) as they were trans ported by gravity and raindrops. The dis ease should therefore have been worse on the lower branches, as in the case of citrus where C. gloeosporioides (now C. acu tatum) infections develop along a descend ing gradient (1). But, it is likely that 
C. kahawae infection by rainfall was less effective on the berries of the lower branches due to a possible barrier effect of the branches in the canopy. In addition, since infection was more severe on the fruits on the upper branches rather than on the lower branches, coffee trees in the umbrella form at Santa, where most of the berries are concentrated toward the canopy, were more severely attacked by CBD than those at 
Bafou. Little is known about the role of coffee tree architecture on CBD develop ment. We feel such a study is necessary to assess the spatial distribution of the disease on a coffee tree scale, and to determine the specific impact of rainfall on its distribution.

At both sites, the best fits for temporal 
CBD spread were obtained with the logis tic model (R2 ≈ 0.998). Logistic regres sions are highly suited to modeling the temporal dynamics of polycyclic epidem ics during which the secondary inoculum is favorable to exponential disease devel opment. They are particularly suitable for pathosystems in which new healthy organs are contaminated gradually during their growth, up to their ontogenic resistance period (27,28,34). At Santa, the rate of disease spread varied each year, probably due to climatic variations, pathogen infec tion pressure, and fruit receptiveness dur ing their growth. However, the ultimate infection level remained substantially the same over the 2 years. The model parame ters (K, B, and r) varied depending on the site and year (Table 3). They would thus seem to confirm the hypothesis of a con siderable influence of mostly random cli matic parameters (rainfall, temperatures, wind, etc.) on the temporal spread of CBD. 
Various spatial analysis methods have been used by numerous authors to study the regionalization of diseases in plots (9,10,22,30,31). Those methods vary de pending on the pathosystems; however, they all have the principle of determining spatial correlations that might exist be tween plants within the plot (3,31). A study of semi-variograms using geostatistical analyses enabled us to identify CBD infec tion foci. Sache defined the focus as “the first point of inoculation characterized by a quantity of disease that is far greater than that seen on surrounding plants” (28). 
Such foci were found at the two sites, in the first year of observations (2003 at 
Santa and 2004 at Bafou). They appeared 1 to 2 weeks after the first symptoms and became blurred during the exponential phase of the disease, precisely at the time of its maximum spread. In the second year of observations, infection foci were not seen at Santa, unlike at Bafou where they persisted from the start of the disease to

Plant Disease / October 2007 1235 the end of observations. These results reflect the nonpermanent nature of CBD infection foci from one year to another in the study plots. In the case of diseases dispersed over large distances, such as rust diseases (4,21), foci may be due to inoculum from outside. 
In the case of annual crop diseases, foci may survive from harvest residues contami nated by the pathogen. In the case of dis eases with limited dispersal, such as an thracnose, especially on perennial crops, primary infection foci are not usually due to an allo-inoculum. Disease emergence is due to a primary inoculum conserved inside the plot, either in the tissues of seemingly healthy organs, or in the tissues of dead organs, such as leaves, branches, or mum mified fruits. All the foci revealed by the semi-variograms were located in the plots by kriging (Figs. 6 and 7). They may have been due to heterogeneous distribution of the primary inoculum in the plot, or appear after highly conducive microclimatic condi tions in particular zones of the plots. It may be, for various reasons, that such microcli mates arise preferentially for several years in certain parts of plots. In that case, they would lead to the recurrent appearance of infection foci in the same places in coffee plantations, as seen over the 2 years of ob servations at Bafou. After harvesting, when there are no longer any berries on the coffee trees, the pathogen survives as a saprophyte in tissues not affected by the infection (15,21). At the beginning of the following season, those tissues are potential sources of auto-inoculation likely to cause fresh infec tions on each plant in the plots. The spread of disease by foci would thus appear to be due to a combined effect, within a particular microclimate, of auto-inoculation of the plants and lateral dispersal of conidia

Infec tion foci soon fade since, in woody plants, the dissemination of diseases with low dis persal is quicker on a tree scale than within a plot. That has also been seen in the case of 
Monilinia fructigena infections on apple (33) or Phytophthora megakarya infections on cocoa (22). 
The isotropy of the semi-variograms ob tained in our study showed that CBD infec tion foci do not appear to follow a preferen tial direction within plots. That result indicates the random nature of CBD dis semination, which is mostly the result of rainfall. The spherical semi-variograms observed at Santa showed us that contami nation took place in a stepwise manner between the coffee trees in the plot, which restricted the infection foci to a small num ber of plants. However, those of the Gaus sian type, mostly found at Bafou, revealed some spatial correlations between coffee trees up to three units apart. That interval, which corresponded in reality to a distance of about 9 m between the trees, was an indi cation that the foci at that site spread to a larger number of individuals when com pared to those seen at Santa. Given the main foci obtained in 2004 at Bafou (Fig. 7A to 
C), the spatial spread of the disease could be estimated at one unit per week, correspond ing to around 3 m per week. 
To conclude, CBD infections start from foci, whose extent and regularity depend on factors that are not yet well known. Such foci occur 1 or 2 weeks after the beginning of the disease and fade at the end of the exponential phase of the disease, shortly before the change in curve concavity. Our results suggest that studies conducted on pathogen survival at these foci will provide useful information for more effective con trol of the disease. Moreover, the epidemic spread curves showed that fruits should be protected from CBD before the 8th week after flowering. ACKNOWLEDGMENTS
