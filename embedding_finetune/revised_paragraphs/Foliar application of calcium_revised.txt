Abstract: Effects of CaCl2 preharvest treatment on postharvest strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) ripening and gray mold development were assessed. Two experiments were conducted in 1987 at two sites. The first experiment studied the effects of the rate of application of CaCl2 and the degree of fruit maturity at treatment using the conventional cultivar Kent. The second experiment investigated the influence of concentration and frequency of application of CaCl2 with the day-neutral ‘Tribute’. Calcium treatment significantly increased fruit and leaf Ca contents, which were closely correlated. The degree of fruit maturity at application and the frequency of treatment did not affect Ca concentration in the tissues. Several maturity criteria were measured during fruit storage in air at 4°C. Anthocyanin and free-sugar contents and tissue electrical conductivity increased, while titratable acidity and firmness decreased. In both experiments, Ca treatment delayed ripening and gray mold development, with the delay increasing alongside Ca concentration. The role of Ca in regulating fruit ripening and vegetable maturation is well established. Research on leaf senescence and fruit ripening indicates that tissue Ca content often influences various senescence characteristics, such as protein and chlorophyll content and respiration rate. Calcium has been applied before and after harvest to prevent physiological disorders and delay ripening in various fruits. Most Ca that enters tissues accumulates in cell walls and membranes, thought to be sites of its antisenescence action. While extensive research has explored the use of Ca to delay ripening of various fruits, little attention has been given to strawberries, which have a short shelf life and are highly susceptible to mold. The present study demonstrates that foliar application of Ca may have beneficial effects on strawberry fruit storage by delaying ripening and development of gray mold.
Materials and Methods: Two experiments were conducted in 1987 using two strawberry cultivars, conventional ‘Kent’ and day-neutral ‘Tribute’. One-year-old plants were treated with CaCl2 via foliar application 3 to 9 days before harvest. In the first experiment, CaCl2 was applied to ‘Kent’ plants at rates of 0, 5, 10, 15, or 20 kg·ha^-1 by repeated runs when the primary fruits were green or pink, i.e., 9 or 3 days before harvest. At harvest, one-fourth to one-half of the pink secondary fruits were picked.

Nicolas series sandy loam at a spacing of 60 cm between plants, 1 m between rows, and 2 m between plots. They were fertilized according to the recommendations of the Québec Dept. of Agriculture (CPVQ, 1982). Ripening after harvest was assessed by measurement of firmness, electrical conductivity, anthocyanins, free sugars, and titratable acidity, and by visual rating of mold development.
In the second experiment, the influence of the rate of application of CaCl2 and the frequency of application on post-harvest senescence of the fruit was investigated using ‘Tribute’. Plants were grown on a Tiny series sandy loam. The layout of the plots was similar to that of Expt. 1. The plants were treated with 0, 10, or 20 kg CaCl2/ha one, two, or three times, i.e., 3, 3, and 6, or 3, 6, and 9 days before harvest. Ripening after harvest was evaluated as in Expt. 1, except that electrical conductivity and anthocyanins were not assayed.
Storage conditions: Immediately after harvest, fruit was pre-cooled and selected for uniformity of size and color (one-fourth to one-half red) and lack of wounding. Berries were stored in polyethylene 26-liter containers under a continuous air stream at 4°C and close to 100% RH for 23 days ('Tribute') or 28 days ('Kent'). There were 15 lots of 40 strawberries in each container. The composition of the atmosphere in the containers was checked by gas chromatography (model 29; Fisher-Hamilton Gas Partitioned, Ottawa, Ont.).
Calcium determination: Exchangeable Ca was determined in soil, leaves, and fruits by atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The leaf and fruit samples were dried at 70°C and digested with nitric and perchloric acids (Gaines and Mitchel, 1979). The soil Ca content was determined by the Mehlich 3 analysis method (Mehlich, 1984).
Measurement of senescence criteria: Total anthocyanins were determined as described by Fuleki and Francis (1968). Anthocyanins were extracted from a 10-g aliquot of a 20- to 30-fruit homogenate with acidified methanol. The results were expressed as absorbance (510 nm) per gram of fresh weight. Free sugars were determined by refractometry (Bausch and Lomb optical series YB 3301; Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, N.Y.). Results were expressed as percent free sugars. Titratable organic acids were measured as described by Morris et al. (1985). Ten grams of homogenate from a 20- to 30-fruit sample were made up to 1
Data analysis. An analysis of variance of the results was carried out following a split-split-plot factorial design (Snedecor and Cochran, 1957). Homogeneity of variance was verified by means of the standard Bartlett test (Anderson and McLean, 1974). Each treatment was distributed over three randomized blocks. Orthogonal contrasts with one degree of freedom were used to determine the response of the measured characteristics.
Results Determination of Ca in soil, leaves, and fruits. Calcium levels in leaves and fruits, although low, varied significantly in correlation with the soil Ca content. Foliar application of CaCl2 caused an increase in Ca level in leaves and fruits in both experiments, but more so in the first one (P < 0.01; 26% at 20 kg·ha-1) than in the second one (P < 0.05; 13%). In both experiments, the increase in Ca content of leaves and fruits was linearly correlated with the rate of application. Calcium levels in leaves and fruits were closely correlated (r = 0.97 and 0.88 for Expts. 1 and 2, respectively). Neither the degree of maturity at application (Expt. 1) nor repeated applications (Expt. 2) influenced the Ca content of the tissues. In Expt. 2, repeated applications did not influence the Ca content of the tissues, but phytotoxicity symptoms were observed on the leaves after the second and third application at 10 and 20 kg·ha-1.
Effect of Ca treatment on ripening. Anthocyanins increased during storage under all treatments, especially in the case of the controls. Color and rate of Ca application were linearly correlated. Although the surface of the berries was pink over one-fourth of the area, the amounts of anthocyanins were very low due to dilution by inner tissues. Free sugars increased in both experiments during storage. This increase was delayed by the Ca treatments, in linear correlation with the Ca concentration. The effect of Ca was more striking at the end of storage. Organic acids slowly decreased during storage, and this decline was delayed by Ca. The effect of Ca was noticeable after 10 days of storage and was linearly correlated with Ca concentration at day 28, especially in Expt. 1. Electrical conductivity of the tissues increased rapidly between day 5 and 10 of storage for all treatments. After 10 days of storage, the increase was less noticeable with the Ca-treated strawberries, and at the end of storage, a linear correlation was observed between this increase and Ca concentration. The significance of the interaction between the rate of application and storage indicated that tissue conductivity varied during storage, depending on the dose of CaCl2 applied. The force required to compress the berries decreased during storage. The lowest values were obtained with control fruit at the end of storage. The linear correlation between the delay in softening after Ca treatment and the dose applied was more significant in Expt. 1 than in Expt. 2. The dose of application x storage interaction was significant for tissue conductivity, indicating that the change in texture during storage depended on Ca concentration. Mold (Botrytis cinerea) was observed after 5 and 12 days in Expts. 1 and 2, respectively. Calcium treatment caused a delay in mold development, especially near the end of storage, and the response was linearly correlated with the rate of application. The dose of application x storage interaction was significant in both experiments. Eight and nine microorganisms were identified on the fruit at harvest in Expts. 1 and 2, respectively. Only Botrytis cinerea developed during storage at
The characteristic symptoms of ripening, including an increase in free sugars, anthocyanins, and tissue conductivity, mold development, and a decrease in titratable acidity and firmness, were observed in the strawberries during storage. Foliar application of calcium chloride (CaCl2) 3 to 9 days before harvest resulted in increased calcium content in the tissues, delayed ripening, and extended storage life. The visual appearance of the Ca-treated fruits remained acceptable at the end of storage, unlike the controls. For most ripening characteristics, the effects of calcium were proportional to the application rate, indicating a direct relationship between calcium content in the tissues and delayed ripening. These findings are consistent with previous research by Eaves and Leefe (1962), who examined the effect of calcium on strawberry texture after storage. Similar effects have been observed in apples (Paliyath et al., 1984), pears (Richardson and Al-Alani, 1982), and avocados (Tingwa and Young, 1974). Calcium protects cellular organization (Jones and Lunt, 1970), thereby preventing certain physiological disorders (Shear, 1975). It may also influence the structure and function of cell walls and membranes, along with aspects of cell metabolism (Glenn et al., 1988; Poovaiah, 1987). The delay in several signs of ripening, such as anthocyanin, free sugar, and organic acid content, supports the role of calcium in regulating cell biochemistry in strawberries. The increase in tissue calcium content following treatment was unaffected by the degree of maturity at treatment or the frequency of application. This insensitivity may be attributed to the relative immobility of calcium in tissues (Hanger, 1979), a known cause of calcium deficiency often seen in leaves and fruits (Ferguson, 1984). The lack of influence of repeated applications in Experiment 2 with ‘Tribute’ and the less pronounced response to calcium treatment may be due to the higher calcium content in soil, leaves, and fruits during this experiment compared to Experiment 1. Exogenous calcium will only bind to cellular sites if these sites are not saturated (Conway and Sams, 1987). Calcium treatment of strawberries may only be beneficial when the calcium content in tissues falls below a critical threshold. The variation in response to calcium application might also stem from differences in the ability of the cultivars to accumulate calcium ions. The phytotoxic effects of repeated applications appear to be minimal (Bramlage et al., 1985). Calcium levels in leaves and fruits were closely correlated, suggesting that calcium determination in leaves may predict levels in fruits at harvest and identify the need for treatment. Soil calcium levels are not a reliable criterion due to the influence of factors such as temperature, humidity, plant age, cultivar, and, especially, the presence of other minerals in the soil on calcium uptake and translocation (Ferguson, 1984). Although several fungi were identified on the strawberries at harvest, only Botrytis cinerea developed during storage at 4°C.
Botrytis grows at temperatures as low as –4°C and is a major limit to the storage life of strawberries. Calcium treatment delayed the development of Botrytis and likely reduced losses due to this pathogen. In conclusion, the foliar application of CaCl2 led to increased calcium content in strawberry fruits and delayed ripening and mold development. Determination of leaf calcium content, closely correlated with fruit calcium content, may serve as an indicator of the need for calcium treatment.
