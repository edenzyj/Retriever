Abstract
Anthracnose of chili (Capsicum spp.) causes major production losses throughout Asia where chili plants are grown. A total of 260 Colletotrichum isolates associated with necrotic lesions of chili leaves and fruit were collected from chili-producing areas of Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Taiwan. Colletotrichum truncatum was the most commonly isolated species from infected chili fruit and was readily identified by its falcate spores and abundant setae in the necrotic lesions. The other isolates consisted of straight conidia (cylindrical and fusiform), which were difficult to differentiate to species based on morphological characters. Taxonomic analysis of these straight conidia isolates based on multi-gene phylogenetic analyses (ITS, gapdh, chs-1, act, tub2, his3, ApMat, gs) revealed a further seven known Colletotrichum species: C. endophyticum, C. fructicola, C. karsti, C. plurivorum, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. In addition, three novel species are also described as C. javanense, C. makassarense, and C. tainanense, associated with anthracnose of chili fruit in West Java (Indonesia), Makassar (South Sulawesi, Indonesia), and Tainan (Taiwan), respectively. Colletotrichum siamense is reported for the first time causing anthracnose of Capsicum annuum in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. This is also the first report of C. fructicola causing anthracnose of chili in Taiwan and Thailand, and C. plurivorum in Malaysia and Thailand. Of the species with straight conidia, C. scovillei (acutatum complex) was the most prevalent throughout the surveyed countries, except for Sri Lanka, from where this species was not isolated. Colletotrichum siamense (gloeosporioides complex) was also common in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Pathogenicity tests on chili fruit showed that C. javanense and C. scovillei were highly aggressive, especially when inoculated on non-wounded fruit,
Taylor (2018) reported from many countries, including Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), Brazil (de Oliveira et al. 2017), China (Diao et al. 2017), India (Sharma and Shenoy 2014), Indonesia (Voorrips et al. 2004), Korea (Kim et al. 1999), Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018), Sri Lanka (Ranathunge et al. 2009), Thailand (Than et al. 2008), and the USA (Harp et al. 2008). Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose of chili in Asia were previously identified as C. acutatum (straight conidia with acute ends), C. gloeosporioides (straight conidia with obtuse ends), and C. truncatum (falcate conidia) (Than et al. 2008, Mongkolporn et al. 2010). However, with the implementation of multigene phylogenetic analyses, C. acutatum was demonstrated to be a species complex (acutatum complex) composed of 34 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with seven species identified as causing anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Similarly, C. gloeosporioides was shown to be a species complex of 38 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with nine species identified to cause anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Morphological characters cannot differentiate many of the species with straight conidia, especially those in the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes that are pathogens of chili; thus, multigene phylogenetic analyses are required for proper identification of these species (De Silva et al. 2017a).
The distribution of the Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose of chili is quite variable across countries that produce this crop. For example, in Australia, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified (De Silva et al. 2017a), in Thailand only three have been reported (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018), and five from Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most of the previous reports, the identification of species was based only on morphological data. Therefore, the status of the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. causing anthracnose in chili-producing countries in Asia remains uncertain. Proper identification of these pathogens is important for mitigating the risk of the incursion of new pathogens, which, if it happens, may have devastating consequences for local industries. In addition, ac
Damm et al. (2019) highlight the importance of understanding the taxonomy, diversity, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species that infect chili and their distribution across countries. The aims of the study were to (1) identify the Colletotrichum species with straight conidia (cylindrical and fusiform) causing anthracnose of chili in selected regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, and (2) determine the pathogenicity of those species on chili.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolates: A total of 260 isolates associated with anthracnose disease symptoms on chili fruit and leaves were collected from chili-producing countries in Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. Type specimens and ex-type cultures are deposited in the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Utrecht, The Netherlands (CBS), and in the University of Melbourne culture collection (UOM), Victoria, Australia.
Fungal isolates were established from lesions on infected fruit and leaves using two methods. Surface sterilized (~1% ai sodium hypochlorite for 5 min) infected tissue (0.5 cm²) was cultured on water agar (WA) and then, after 2 to 3 days, fungal hyphae were subcultured onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and synthetic nutrient-poor agar (SNA) as described by De Silva et al. (2017a). Freshly collected fruit from field-grown chili plants with typical anthracnose lesions was incubated for 1 to 2 days in a moist chamber until conidiomata appeared, followed by single spore isolation. Selected isolates were also cultured on oatmeal agar (OA) and malt extract agar (MEA) at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Cultures were isolated and maintained either at the AQIS quarantine laboratory at the University of Melbourne or the Evolutionary Pathology Laboratory at the Westerdijk Fungal Biod
The 260 Colletotrichum isolates were initially identified based on culture characteristics on PDA (using distinct morphotype groups), morphology of the spores, and/or internal transcribed spacer and intervening 5.8S nrDNA gene (ITS) sequence. A total of 115 isolates were identified as C. truncatum, while the remaining 145 isolates, which had straight conidia, were subsequently selected for multigene phylogenetic analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh mycelia grown on PDA using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA quality was assessed on a 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel, quantified by comparing with a known amount of Lambda DNA/HindIII marker, diluted to 2 ng/μL, and stored at -20 °C until ready for PCR.
Isolates belonging to the acutatum complex were further analyzed using partial gene sequences from five genomic loci: an intron sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), and partial sequences of chitin synthase 1 (chs-1), actin (act), beta-tubulin (tub2), and histone 3 (his3) genes. Isolates of the gloeosporioides complex were analyzed using chs-1, act, gapdh, tub2, Apn2–MAT1–2 intergenic spacer, and partial mating type MAT1–2 gene (ApMat) and glutamine synthetase (gs) genes. Isolates belonging to the boninense and orchidearum complexes were further analyzed using gapdh, tub2, and act genes. The genes were amplified and sequenced using the respective primer pairs for each gene region. The PCR for each reaction was performed in a Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 25 μL, comprised of 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM dNTP, 0.4 μM of each primer, 2 mM MgCl2, 1 U Taq DNA polymerase, and 6 ng template DNA, with components adjusted as required.
PCR amplification protocols were performed as described by Damm et al. and Silva et al., with annealing temperatures adjusted to 55 °C for ITS, gapdh, and tub2; 58 °C for act; 60 °C for gs; and 62 °C for ApMat. All PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit, according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequence analysis of the PCR products was conducted at either the Australian Genome Research Facility or at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute. The purified PCR products were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions, and the consensus sequences were obtained by alignment using Geneious Pro. The consensus sequences were deposited in GenBank, with taxonomic novelties recorded in MycoBank. Sequences of each locus were assembled using MEGA.

Geneious Pro v. 11.1.4 was used to align sequences with CLUSTALW2 (Larkin et al. 2007) and manually edited where necessary. ITS and tub2 sequences of selected isolates representing all species complexes were analyzed to determine the clade to which each isolate belonged, and an initial phylogenetic tree was produced using a maximum likelihood analysis (ML) as implemented in MEGA v. 6 with 1000 bootstrap replicates (data not shown). For isolates from the acutatum complex, concatenated datasets were generated comprising ITS, chs-1, act, gapdh, his3, and tub2 gene sequences. For isolates from the gloeosporioides complex, two concatenated datasets were created, one comprising ITS, chs-1, act, gapdh, and tub2 gene sequences, and the other comprising ApMat and gs gene sequences. For isolates from the boninense and orchidearum complexes, concatenated datasets were generated comprising ITS, gapdh, act, and tub2 gene sequences. Selected reference or ex-type strains from each complex were included in the analyses (Damm et al. 2012b, 2019; Marin-Felix et al. 2017; Weir et al. 2012). Further phylogenetic analyses were performed using MrBayes v. 3.2.6 (Ronquist et al. 2012) for Bayesian inference analyses (BI) and PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2003) for parsimony analyses. For BI analyses, the best nucleotide substitution model for each locus was determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004), and eight simultaneous MCMC chains were run for 1 billion generations. Trees were sampled every 100 generations for the acutatum, boninense, and orchidearum complexes, every 1000 generations for the gloeosporioides complex 2-gene alignment, and every 10 generations for the gloeosporioides complex 5-gene alignment. The heating parameter was set to 0.2, and analyses stopped once the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. The first 25% of trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining trees in each analysis were used to calculate posterior probabilities. The generated 50% majority rule consensus tree was viewed in TreeView v. 1.6.6 (Page 1996). A maximum parsimony (MP) analysis was performed on the multilocus alignments as well as for each gene separately with PAUP v. 4.0b10 using the heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Gaps were treated as new character states and missing data as missing characters. Bootstrap support values were calculated based on 1000 bootstrap replicates. Statistical measures calculated included tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), and rescaled consistenc
Yijkl = μ + Si + Ij(Si) + Rk + Rk ∗ Si + Rk ∗ Ij(Si) + eijkl, where μ is the grand mean, Si is the fixed species effect, and Rk, RkSi, RkIj(Si), and eijkl are respectively the random effects of replicate, replicate by species interaction, replicate by isolate within species interaction, and error. Separate analyses were done for wound and non-wound data, as preliminary analysis showed there was a significant species by wound interaction. Least squared means were estimated for each species, and t-tests were carried out between each pair of means.
RESULTS
Isolates
The Colletotrichum isolates with falcate conidia and ITS sequences matching those of the ex-type of C. truncatum were the most common (n = 115), representing 44% of all isolates. Colletotrichum truncatum was found in collections from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. Colletotrichum truncatum isolates were not included in the collection from the World Vegetable Center in Taiwan, as only species with straight conidia were selected for identification. The remaining 56% of isolates (n = 145) were species with straight conidia, mostly belonging to the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes.
Phylogenetic analyses
Acutatum complex
For the 69 isolates and 29 reference species in the acutatum complex, the phylogenetic analysis of the combined data sets used six genes (ITS, tub2, gapdh, chs-1, act). The statistical information from the different phylogenetic analyses performed on each Colletotrichum complex included parameters and statistics of the Bayesian analyses, with a total number of generations run, substitution models, and the number of trees used in consensus. The analyses for various complexes such as acutatum, boninense, and gloeosporioides provided insights into the genetic relationships and characteristics of these species. The results showed varying degrees of consistency and retention indices, highlighting the complexities involved in understanding these fungal groups.
Silva et al. (2019) conducted a study on the phylogenetic analysis of the Colletotrichum acutatum complex, which included 100 isolates with C. boninense (CBS 123755) as the outgroup. The analysis comprised 2,315 characters, including alignment gaps and excluded characters. A Bayesian analysis of this alignment, based on 629 unique site patterns (ITS: 108, tub2: 134, gapdh: 151, act: 86, chs-1: 54, and his3: 96), lasted 3,040,000 generations, yielding 60,802 total trees, of which 45,602 were used to calculate posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis resulted in a maximum of 1,000 equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values from the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis (MP > 49%) and Bayesian inference (BI) posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes. The species clades recognized received similar support values, although the associations between species did not always receive similar support; for example, the node linking C. paranaense and C. melonis showed MP < 50% and PP = 0.99. The phylogenetic analyses identified C. scovillei as the most prevalent species in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan, although it was not isolated from Sri Lanka.
The data regarding various isolates is extensive. Notably, C. brisbanense (CBS 292.67) and C. lupini (CBS 109225) were found in Taiwan. Isolates such as C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) were documented from multiple locations including Taiwan and Thailand. Other species like C. guajavae and C. walleri were noted with specific collections from Indonesia and Taiwan, respectively. The analyses revealed a diverse representation of isolates across various countries, with bootstrap support values indicating the reliability of the relationships among species.
Silva et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:1 Page 16 of 32 Lanka. In addition, an isolate from Java in Indonesia (UOM 1115) clustered related to C. brisbanense (96% BS/1 PP).
For the four isolates and ten reference species in the boninense complex, the phylogenetic analyses of the combined data sets using five genes (ITS, gapdh, tub2, act, and chs-1), with C. truncatum (CBS 151.35) as the outgroup, comprised 24 isolates and 1867 characters, including the alignment gaps and excluded characters. The Bayesian analysis of the combined alignment, based on 432 unique site patterns (ITS: 42, gapdh: 130, tub2: 111, act: 94, and chs-1: 55), lasted 80,000 generations, resulting in 16,002 total trees, of which 12,002 trees were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis yielded three equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values of the MP analysis (MP > 49%) and the BI posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes. Overall, the nodes received similar support values, except for the subclustering of strains CBS 128545, CBS 128548, and CBS 129927 in the C. karsti clade (MP 67% / PP = 0.98). The phylogenetic analyses of the boninense complex identified the most prevalent species as C. karsti, which occurs only in Indonesia.
For the gloeosporioides complex, two phylogenetic trees were constructed from the 42 isolates and 41 reference species. One tree was based on the ApMat and gs sequence alignment, and the second was based on the ITS, gapdh, act, tub2, and chs-1 sequence alignment. The analyses using the five-gene alignment, with C. theobromicola CBS 124945 as the outgroup, comprised 85 isolates, including the outgroup, and 1863 characters, including the alignment gaps and excluded characters. The Bayesian analysis of the combined alignment, based on 556 unique site patterns (ITS: 73, gapdh: 163, act: 85, tub2: 180, chs-1: 55), lasted 685,000 generations, resulting in 137,002 total trees, of which 102,752 trees were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis yielded a maximum of 1000 equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values of the MP analysis (MP > 49%) and the BI posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes. Overall, the species clades recognized in this study received similar support values, except for the C. siamense clade (MP < 50% / PP < 0.91) and the C. fructicola clade (MP 57% / PP = 0.99). The analysis using the ApMat and gs sequence alignment comprised 92 isolates with C. theobromicola CBS 124945 as the outgroup and 1824 characters, including the alignment gaps and excluded characters.
The Bayesian analysis of the combined alignment, based on 952 unique site patterns (ApMat: 520, gs: 432), lasted 29,500,000 generations, resulting in 590,002 total trees, of which 442,502 trees were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis yielded 161 equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values of the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis (MP > 49%) and the Bayesian inference (BI) posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes. Overall, the species clades recognized in this study received similar support values, except for the C. siamense clade (MP = 92% / PP < 0.91). Phylogenetic analyses of the gloeosporioides species complex identified 69% (29) of the chili fruit isolates as C. siamense. In the 2-gene tree, a distinct subclade within the C. siamense clade formed with 100% bootstrap support, containing isolates from Chiang Mai in Thailand and Gowa and Jeneponto in South Sulawesi of Indonesia. These isolates from Indonesia and Thailand exhibited very distinct sequences compared to the ex-type reference C. siamense strain (CBS 130417), with a 28 bp difference in the gs gene and a 25 bp difference in the ApMat gene. A significant subclade formed within C. siamense with full (100% bootstrap support / 1 posterior probability) support values in the 2-gene tree. The same isolates in the 5-gene tree did not show the same level of difference but demonstrated strong similarity among the C. siamense isolates. In the 2-gene tree, there were also significant subclades of isolates associated with different geographical regions, including various species of Colletotrichum with specific bootstrap support and posterior probability values indicating their phylogenetic relationships and geographical distributions.
Bayesian analysis of the ApMat and gs regions reveals the parsimony bootstrap support values (MP > 49%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) at the nodes (MP/PP). The tree was rooted to C. theobromicola (CBS 124945), with a bar indicating 0.02 expected changes per site. Colored blocks denote clades containing isolates from chili, particularly the distinct subclade of Sri Lankan isolates (UOM 1116, UOM 1117, UOM 1118) from Kandy and the separate subclade of Thai isolates from Ratchaburi (UOM 1132, UOM 1133, UOM 1134). Other species identified in the gloeosporioides complex included C. endophyticum and C. fructicola from Thailand, C. fructicola and C. tainanense sp. nov. from Taiwan, and C. tropicale and C. makassarense sp. nov. from Indonesia. Most identified species, including the two new species, were supported in distinct clades with significant bootstrap values in both the 5-gene and 2-gene trees. However, due to a lack of sequence data of the ApMat gene for some reference strains, it was challenging to provide good support for the placement of some species such as C. endophyticum in the 2-gene trees. Three isolates (CPC 28607, UOM 1002, UOM 1003) from the Makassar region in Indonesia exhibited a close relationship to the reference species C. tropicale in the ApMat and gs tree. Individual gene trees of the ITS, act, tub2, and chs-1 loci also supported these isolates as C. tropicale. However, in the 5-gene tree, a separate subclade formed with full support (100% BS/1 PP), distinct from the C. tropicale reference species. In both trees, two isolates (UOM 1120, UOM 1119) collected from Tainan in Taiwan formed a significant distinct clade with full support (100% BS/1 PP), separate from the C. salsolae complex.
For the six isolates and nine reference species in the orchidearum complex, the phylogenetic analysis of the combined datasets using four genes (ITS, gapdh, tub2, and act), with C. dracaenophilum (CBS 118199) as the outgroup, comprised 26 isolates and 1543 characters, including alignment gaps and excluded characters. The Bayesian analysis of the combined alignment, based on 221 unique site patterns (I
The phylogenetic analysis of Colletotrichum isolates in the gloeosporioides complex is based on a 50% majority rule consensus tree derived from Bayesian analysis of combined sequences (ITS, tub2, gapdh, chs-1, and act). The parsimony bootstrap support values (MP > 49%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) are displayed at the nodes (MP/PP). The tree was rooted to C. theobromicola. The scale bar indicates 0.009 expected changes per site, with colored blocks indicating clades containing isolates from chili. The analyses identified isolates from Thailand and Malaysia as C. plurivorum. Five isolates from Thailand, including three from infected chili leaves in Chiang Rai and two from infected green chili fruit in Bangkok, formed a poorly supported subclade within C. plurivorum.
Morphological observations and phylogenetic data of the straight conidia species identified three novel species: two from Indonesia and one from Taiwan. Detailed morphological descriptions are provided for all Colletotrichum species associated with chili anthracnose.
Colletotrichum javanense D.D. De Silva, P.W. Crous & P.W.J. Taylor, sp. nov. (MycoBank MB826936) is named after Java, the island in Indonesia where it was collected. It differs from C. brisbanense by forming distinct chlamydospores and acervular conidiomata on all media tested, while C. brisbanense only produced conidiomata on Anthriscus stem, without basal cells observed. Additionally, C. javanense grows faster than C. brisbanense, with diameters of 60 mm, 55 mm, and 66 mm on OA, MEA, and SNA in 7 days, respectively, compared to 18.5 mm and 20 mm for C. brisbanense on OA and SNA in the same period.
Colletotrichum species such as C. cliviicola, C. vittalense, C. orchidearum, C. sojae, and others were also examined, highlighting the diversity of isolates from various regions, including Thailand and Malaysia. The findings emphasize the significance of understanding the morphological and genetic characteristics of these species in relation to chili anthracnose.

Culture characteristics: Colonies on PDA reached 48–54 mm in diameter after 7 days (6.5–7.5 mm/day), flat with an entire margin; the surface was covered with grey to olive-green short aerial mycelium, the margin was white to light grey, and the reverse was mostly cream whitish, with olivaceous grey to black in the center. Yellow to orange acervular conidiomata were observed. Colonies on SNA were 60–66 mm in diameter after 7 days (8–9.5 mm/day), flat with an entire margin, hyaline to pale brown, and the surface was covered with short grey aerial mycelium, with the reverse displaying the same colors. Orange acervular conidiomata were present at the center of the culture. Colonies on OA measured 55–60 mm in diameter after 7 days (7.8–8.5 mm/day), flat with an entire margin; the surface was covered with cream to grey short aerial mycelium, the margin was white, and the reverse was mostly light orange with brown pigments. Orange acervular conidiomata were also observed. Colonies on MEA had a surface with pale grey short aerial mycelium, while the reverse was light orange.
Notes: The closest match in a BLAST search with the gapdh sequence was GenBank JQ948617, C. sloanei strain IMI 364297, with 98% identity (4 bp differences). The closest matches with the his3 sequence, with 99% identity (2 bp differences), were GenBank JQ949279 C. indonesiense strain CBS 127551 and GenBank KJ947248 C. guajavae isolate OBP19.
Colletotrichum makassarense D.D. De Silva, P.W. Crous & P.W.J. Taylor, sp. nov. MycoBank MB827691.
Etymology: Named after Makassar, the city in South Sulawesi, Indonesia, where the species was collected.
Diagnosis: Colletotrichum makassarense is phylogenetically closely related to C. tropicale. Sequence data from ITS could not separate the two species, but they can be distinguished by all other genes tested, most effectively using ApMat (22 bp differences) and gs (18 bp differences) sequence data.
Type: Indonesia: Makassar, from fruit lesions of Capsicum annuum, 7 Jun. 2015, P.W.J. Taylor & A. Nasruddin (CBS H-143664 – holotype; CBS 143664 = CPC 28612 – ex-type cultures).
Description: Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on OA. Vegetative mycelium consists
Diagnosis: Colletotrichum tainanense differs from its closest phylogenetic neighbor C. salsolae in culture characteristics on PDA, exhibiting sparse aerial mycelium and a pale mouse-grey surface mycelium. In contrast, C. salsolae produces a layer of acervuli-like structures with deep orange-brown conidial masses and numerous setae. The two species can be differentiated using all tested genes except for ITS, with the most effective distinctions found in gapdh (7 bp difference), tub2 (6 bp difference), and act (5 bp difference) sequences. There is only one bp difference in the chs-1 sequence between the two species.

Notes: Colletotrichum siamense isolates from different countries showed variation in morphological characters, growth rates, and culture morphology on PDA. Representative conidial measurements for isolates representing different subclades in the phylogenetic trees are as follows: CPC 30233 (Gowa, Indonesia), 12.5–17 × 2.5–5.5 μm; UOM 1132 (Ratchaburi, Thailand), 9.5–14.5 × 3.5–5 μm; UOM 1126/F4-1C (Kanchanaburi, Thailand), 12–15 × 5–7 μm; UOM 1116 (Kandy, Sri Lanka), 10.5–16.5 × 3.5–5.5 μm. These morphological characters within a subclade were highly consistent within each country. The species was described by Prihastuti et al. (2009); conidia of the ex-holotype specimen (ICMP 18578/BDP-I2) were reported as 7–18.3 × 3–4.3 μm (x = 10.18 ± 1.74 × 3.46 ± 0.36), which encompasses the range observed in our isolates. This species is biologically and geographically diverse, found on many hosts across several tropical and subtropical regions.

Silva et al. IMA Fungus (2019) 10:1 Page 26 of 32 in the necrotic lesions. Of the species with straight conidia, C. scovillei (acutatum complex) was the most common species throughout the surveyed countries (35%), except for Sri Lanka, where this species was not isolated. Colletotrichum siamense (gloeosporioides complex) was the next most common species, occurring in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia (11%). The remaining species were represented by fewer than 10% of the total number of isolates. In Indonesia, C. scovillei was isolated from infected chili fruit in all surveyed regencies of South Sulawesi, except in Makassar, and in the field trial site in West Java.
The mean lesion sizes of symptoms caused by Colletotrichum species with straight conidia on inoculated mature red fruit of Capsicum annuum cv. Bangchang were measured under both wound and non-wound inoculation conditions. In wound inoculation, C. scovillei had the highest mean lesion size of 20.3 mm, followed by C. javanense at 15.6 mm. Other species like C. siamense and C. fructicola had smaller mean lesions, with values of 9.7 mm and 7.8 mm, respectively. In non-wound inoculation, C. javanense also had the highest mean lesion size at 9.4 mm, while C. scovillei followed closely at 9.1 mm. Several species, including C. makassarense, C. tropicale, and C. plurivorum, showed very small lesions or no visible symptoms at all (mean lesion sizes less than 1 mm).
In Thailand, C. scovillei was primarily isolated from the northern provinces of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai, as well as from infected chili fruit in a trial site of Kasetsart University in Nakhon Pathom. The western provinces had a high incidence of C. siamense, with one isolate of C. endophyticum collected from Kanchana Buri. Colletotrichum plurivorum was isolated from chili leaves with necrotic lesions in Chiang Rai and from necrotic lesions of chili fruit found in a restaurant in the Phaya Thai area of Bangkok. In addition, C. fructicola was identified from fruit collected in Chiang Mai. In Taiwan, a new species, C. tainanense, was collected from infected chili fruit in the Tainan province, while C. fructicola was identified from fruit in Hsinchu and Nantou, Taiwan. Colletotrichum plurivorum was also identified from a fruit collected in Johor, Malaysia.
Pathogenicity studies showed that all the Colletotrichum species caused anthracnose symptoms on wounded fruit, but there were significant differences in the severity of the symptoms. On wounded fruit, isolates of C. scovillei and C. javanense exhibited the highest disease severity, producing large necrotic lesions with mean sizes of 15.6–20.3 mm. On non-wounded fruits, all species were less pathogenic, with mean lesion sizes below 10 mm. C. makassarense, C. tropicale, and C. plurivorum produced only very small lesions or no visible sym
Lesions caused by C. scovillei were significantly larger than those caused by all other species except for C. javanense in wounded fruit and C. endophyticum in unwounded fruit. The significance of the pairwise t-tests is strongly dependent on the number of isolates of each species sampled; thus, the groupings observed do not simply change with the magnitude of the mean differences. A large difference may not be significant if both species have small sample sizes, while a smaller difference may be significant. In particular, comparisons involving C. javanense and C. endophyticum are very imprecise, as only one isolate of each species was tested.
DISCUSSION
Colletotrichum isolates collected from infected fruit and leaf tissue of chili plants from Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia were allocated to different species complexes, with 11 Colletotrichum species identified and three new species described. Colletotrichum truncatum was the most prevalent species causing anthracnose of chili in Asia, supporting previous reports of its wide distribution on chili fruit throughout Asia, Australia, and South America. Colletotrichum truncatum has a broad host range, infecting many crop species. The remaining 56% of isolates with straight conidia belonged to the gloeosporioides, acutatum, boninense, and orchidearum species complexes. Among these, C. scovillei, in the acutatum complex, was the most prominent species (35% of the total isolates) and was distributed in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan. However, C. scovillei was not identified in the survey of Sri Lanka, possibly due to the small number of samples assessed. Previous studies have also reported the predominance of C. scovillei in Asia and Brazil, but this species has not been identified in Australia and remains a significant biosecurity threat to the Australian capsicum/chili industry. Further surveys are required to confirm the presence of C. scovillei in Australia and Sri Lanka.
Colletotrichum siamense, in the gloeosporioides complex, was also prominent (11% of total isolates) in causing anthracnose of chili fruit in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but was not detected in Malaysia and Taiwan. Nevertheless, previous reports indicated the identification of C. siamense in Malaysia, possibly due to a larger sampling size of infected chili across states. Within the C. siamense clade, small subclades were observed that coincided with different geographical regions from which the isolates were collected. Colletotrichum siamense has been reported to infect chili in Asia, Australia, and Brazil, and is a common pathogen of many other plant species. Isolates from different countries appeared to show different morphological characteristics, with varying growth rates and culture morphologies. This variability indicated that this taxon has high intra-specific diversity. The combined gene analyses of ApMat and gs sequences also revealed significant insights into the relationships among the isolates.
Silva et al. (2019) supported the distinction of subclades within the C. siamense clade. In recent years, there has been significant debate on whether C. siamense s. lat. should be separated into different species groups within the gloeosporioides complex, with the number of accepted species ranging from one to seven (Weir et al. 2012; Udayanga et al. 2013). However, a recent case study concluded that C. siamense s. lat. was a single species rather than a species complex, as no independent evolutionary lineages were found within this species (Liu et al. 2016a).
Colletotrichum tropicale is reported for the first time as causing anthracnose in Capsicum in Indonesia. Rojas et al. (2010) noted that C. tropicale was initially isolated from a wide range of hosts in forests in tropical America, including rotting fruit and as a leaf endophyte. Silva et al. (2017) recently reported C. tropicale causing chili anthracnose in Brazil. Additionally, C. tropicale has been reported from Japan, Panama, Thailand, and other host species (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018).
Colletotrichum fructicola is reported for the first time as causing chili anthracnose in Thailand and Taiwan. Previously, C. fructicola was reported to cause anthracnose in chili from India and China (Sharma and Shenoy 2014; Diao et al. 2017). Prihastuti et al. (2009) originally isolated C. fructicola from coffee berries in Thailand, and it was later reported as a leaf endophyte from several plants in South America (Weir et al. 2012; Vieira et al. 2014). C. fructicola has a wide host range and was identified by Weir et al. (2012) as a biologically and geographically diverse species.
All species in the gloeosporioides complex were identified using combined multi-locus gene analyses, based on the ITS, gapdh, chs-1, act, and tub2 genes, which showed higher diversity in chili compared to the acutatum, boninense, and orchidearum species complexes. The phylogenetic tree provided good resolution of the species with high support values, supporting the species boundaries and identifying novel species. Phylogenetic trees built from ApMat and gs gene sequences exhibited similar topologies to the multigene phylogenetic tree, confirming that the ApMat and gs loci were highly informative and distinguished most species in the gloeosporioides species complex (Silva et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015).
However, some recent new species (Diao et al. 2017; Marin-Felix et al. 2017) could not be pla
Although four isolates from Indonesia were identified as C. karsti in the boninense complex, they formed a subclade within the C. karsti species clade and had different conidial sizes compared to the ex-type strain of C. karsti (Yang et al. 2011), suggesting that these might be a new species. However, sufficient phylogenetic support was not observed in all the individual gene trees to justify the introduction of a novel species. Additionally, Damm et al. (2012a, 2012b) reported that the conidium size of C. karsti was quite variable. Colletotrichum karsti has been reported from China and India to cause anthracnose disease in Capsicum spp. (Liu et al. 2016b; Saini et al. 2016; Diao et al. 2017). Colletotrichum karsti has the widest known host range and distribution of all species in the boninense complex (Damm et al. 2012b). Most of the C. karsti strains had been isolated as endophytes, but a few were derived from diseased plant tissues. This species has mostly been isolated from dicotyledonous plants, although some have occurred on monocotyledonous families, especially Orchidaceae and Musaceae (Damm et al. 2012b).
Colletotrichum plurivorum was identified for the first time as causing anthracnose in Thailand and Malaysia. The five C. plurivorum isolates from chili in Thailand formed a distinct subclade with high support values within the C. plurivorum subclade, separating them from C. cliviicola (syn. C. cliviae, Damm et al. 2019). In addition, the C. plurivorum isolates formed a characteristic sexual morph in culture, which was not reported for C. cliviicola (Yang et al. 2009). Recently, Damm et al. (2019) resolved the taxonomic placement of several Colletotrichum strains that did not belong to any of the accepted species complexes and assigned them to three new species complexes, including the orchidearum complex. Recent studies in China and Brazil also identified multiple species belonging to these complexes, including C. brevisporum, C. cliviicola, C. liaoningense, and C. plurivorum, that caused anthracnose disease in chili (Liu et al. 2016b; De Silva et al. 2017b; Diao et al. 2017). Colletotrichum plurivorum belongs to the orchidearum complex, with many isolates reported to have a large host range (Damm et al. 2019). The type specimen was described as new from Coffea in Vietnam (Nguyen et al. 2010). Colletotrichum plurivorum was originally described as C. sichuanensis from Capsicum annuum in the Sichuan Province of China (Liu et al. 2016b). However, the name was invalid because no holotype specimen was cited (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018; Damm et al. 2019).
Pathogenicity tests of Colletotrichum spp. from chili showed that while all the species were pathogenic on chili fruits after wounding the fruit surface, most produced a low level of infection on non-wounded
Mongkolporn et al. (2010) identified pathotypes of C. truncatum, C. scovillei (formerly C. acutatum), and C. siamense (formerly C. gloeosporioides) within isolates of each species from Thailand. Pathotypes were identified by inoculating wounded fruit of Capsicum baccatum and C. chinense genotypes. All isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum in Mongkolporn et al. (2010) were subsequently re-identified as C. siamense and C. scovillei, respectively, except for isolate UOM 1137 (F5-2D), which was identified as C. endophyticum. The isolate UOM 1137 was pathogenic in both the wound and non-wound bioassays and was classified in the most virulent C. siamense pathotype group (PCg1-R) in Mongkolporn et al. (2010). This contrasts with the study by Manamgoda et al. (2013), where C. endophyticum was described as an endophyte of Pennisetum purpureum. The severity of infection in chili may indicate that Capsicum annuum was the preferred host for C. endophyticum, while P. purpureum was a less favored host, where the pathogen infected but existed in an endophytic lifestyle. In addition, isolate UOM 1137 also has shorter spores than the type isolate of C. endophyticum, thus further isolates of this species need to be collected from chili plants and P. purpureum in Thailand to confirm taxonomy and pathogenicity.
CONCLUSIONS: Multigene phylogenetic analyses of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of Capsicum in Asia showed high species diversity with the identification of 11 different Colletotrichum species, including three novel species. Although C. siamense has been reported as infecting many plant species before, this was the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose in chili in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. This was also the first report of C. fructicola infecting chili in Thailand and Taiwan. In addition, all three novel species were new additions to the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili. More surveys in countries in Asia and Oceania need to be conducted to identify the diversity and prevalence of species causing chili anthracnose. Understanding the taxonomy and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. has great significance to the fruit and vegetable industries, where there are serious biosecurity implications of incursions by exotic pathogens.
