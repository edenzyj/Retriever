ABSTRACT
DELP, B. R., and R. D. MILHOLLAND. 1980. Control of strawberry anthracnose with captafol. Plant Disease 64:1013-1015. Strawberry anthracnose (Colletotrichum fragariae) causes severe losses in strawberry nurseries throughout the southeastern United States, despite the use of the recommended fungicide, benomyl. Fungitoxic concentrations of captafol, captan, maneb, and benomyl to C. fragariae in vitro were 1.0, 100, 100, and 500 µg a.i./ml, respectively. Captafol controlled the disease in the field if applied every 7 days but was ineffective when applied every 14 days. Benomyl, maneb, and captan were ineffective. In 1978 and 1979, there were no significant differences in yield among the captafol treatments applied every 7 days at 1.2, 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 g a.i./L. Disease was more severe at the two lower rates in 1979. Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks, has been a serious problem on strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa L.) for many years in Florida and Louisiana, but it was not a problem in North Carolina until 1975 when it reached epidemic proportions. The fungus attacks all aboveground plant parts, causing elongated black lesions on petioles and runners, fruit rot, and crown rot, which kills the plant. Controls that have been investigated include sanitation practices, resistant varieties, and fungicide treatments. The fungicide benomyl has been recommended for control of strawberry anthracnose since 1971. In the last few years, benomyl has become less effective in controlling the disease in North Carolina, suggesting the development of a resistant strain. A recent communication confirmed the presence of a benomyl-resistant strain of C. fragariae in Louisiana. This paper presents the results of a laboratory and field search for a more effective control.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungicide bioassay. In vitro action of several fungicides on C. fragariae was determined using Neely and Himelick's cellophane diffusion technique for simultaneous determination of fungistatic and fungicidal properties. The fungicides were serially diluted to concentrations of 0.04, 0.2, 1.0, 5.0, 20, 100, and 500 µg/ml. Concentrations of 0.04-20 µg/ml were used in the fungistatic tests, and concentrations of 1.0-500 µg/ml were used in the fungicidal tests. A deionized water control was included in each test. The fungicides evaluated were captafol (Difolatan 4F), capta
Fungicidal properties were determined by transferring the disks to potato dextrose agar after 3 hours of exposure to a fungicide. A treatment was considered fungicidal if no growth occurred after 3 days. Fungistatic properties were determined by counting 100 conidia per disk after a 24-hour exposure to fungicides. A concentration was considered fungistatic if less than 1% of the conidia germinated. The length of 10 germ tubes per disk was measured at this time.
Field tests were conducted in 1978 and 1979 with the susceptible cultivar Surecrop. Plants were obtained from a registered planting at the Sandhills Research Station in Jackson Springs, NC, where anthracnose had not been observed. The plants were set in soil treated with methyl bromide (97 kg/ha) in November for weed control. Rows were spaced 1.2 m apart, with every other row used as a border. Plots consisted of three plants spaced 0.6 m apart, and plots within rows were 1.2 m apart. Each treatment was replicated four times. Fungicide treatments were applied from mid-May through September at 7- and 14-day intervals in 1978 and at 7-day intervals in 1979. A CO₂ pressurized sprayer, operating at 2.1 kg/cm² (30 psi), was used to wet all plant parts to runoff.
The 1978 treatments consisted of captafol 4F applied at 2.4, 3.6, and 4.8 g a.i./L of water (2, 3, and 4 lb/100 gal); benomyl 50W at 0.6 g a.i./L; maneb 80W at 1.9 g a.i./L; and a mix of benomyl 50W and maneb 80W at 0.6 and 1.9 g a.i./L, respectively. Unsprayed plots served as controls. The 1979 treatments included captafol 4F at the same concentrations plus a lower concentration of 1.2 g a.i./L. Captan 50W at 2.4 g a.i./L alone and with benomyl 50W at 0.6 g a.i./L replaced the maneb 80W treatments. Benomyl 50W was applied alone at 0.6 g a.i./L.
Fungistatic and fungicidal concentrations were determined for Colletotrichum fragariae, with specific concentrations measured for various fungicides across different isolates. These included captafol, captan, chlorothalonil, maneb, benomyl, triforine, and CGA 64251. Concentrations were assessed for their effectiveness in preventing germination and growth.
Beginning 24 hours after the first fungicide application, border row plants were inoculated at weekly intervals for 3 weeks by spraying the petioles and runners with a conidial suspension of C. fragariae. This allowed for natural spread to treatment row plants after border row plants became infected. Data on disease severity and plant growth were collected in July and August. Plots were rated on a disease index as follows: 1 = no plant loss, none to slight infection (0-25% of the runners with small lesions); 2 = 1-5% plant loss, slight to moderate infection (26-75% of the runners with small lesions); 3 = 6-25% plant loss, moderate to general infection (26-75% of the runners with elongated lesions); 4 = 26-50% plant loss, general to severe infection (76-100% of the runners infected); 5 = 51-100% plant loss, severe to total
Fungicide bioassay. Concentrations of fungicides that were fungistatic or fungicidal to C. fragariae varied among isolates in all cases except where the fungicide was completely effective at the lowest concentration or completely ineffective at the highest concentration. In general, isolate CF-9 was more tolerant than other isolates. In the maneb fungistatic test and the captan fungicidal test, isolate CF-16 was as tolerant as CF-9. Other variations between isolates followed no discernible pattern. Captafol and captan were the most effective against all isolates. Captafol was fungistatic and fungicidal at the lowest concentrations of 0.04 and 1.0 µg/ml, respectively. Although not as effective as captafol, captan was fungistatic at 0.2-1.0 µg/ml and fungicidal at 20-100 µg/ml. Germination was reduced by captan from 90% in the control to 33% and 10% at 0.04 and 0.2 µg/ml, respectively. Captan also reduced germ tube length from 41 µm in the control to 14 µm and 6 µm at 0.04 and 0.2 µg/ml, respectively. Chlorothalonil was fungistatic at 1.0-5.0 µg/ml but not fungicidal up to 500 µg/ml. The response to maneb varied; fungistatic concentrations ranged from 1.0 µg/ml of maneb for CF-1 to 20 µg/ml for CF-4, -9, and -16. A concentration of 100 µg/ml was fungicidal for all isolates except CF-9, which was killed at 500 µg/ml. Germination was only slightly inhibited at concentrations of 0.2 µg/ml of maneb and lower, but 5.0 µg/ml reduced germination to 33% from over 90% in the control. Germ tube length was 42 µm for the control and 39 µm for maneb at 0.2 µg/ml, but it was reduced to 8 µm at 5.0 µg/ml. Appressorium formation was extensive on both the control and treatment disks of the maneb test; the cause was unknown. Neither CGA 64251 nor triforine were fungicidal or fungistatic. Benomyl was not fungistatic but was fungicidal at 500 µg/ml on CF-1. Benomyl did not reduce germination but caused extensive branching and irregular growth of germ tubes at concentrations of 0.2 µg/ml or greater. The mode of action of benomyl is on cell division; therefore, a reduction in germination would not be expected. The germ tube distortion indicates that the isolates tested are sensitive to benomyl. Triforine did not inhibit germination, but germ tube growth was reduced from 251 µm in the control to 77 µm at 20 µg/ml.
Fungicide field evaluations. In 1978, anthracnose lesions developed on inoculated border row plants in late May and appeared on treated plants by early June. Disease developed rapidly, killing 90% of the border row plants by mid-July. This placed treatment plots under extreme disease pressure. Differences in disease indices were slight among the plots that were treated at 7-day intervals and rated in July. In general, plots treated with captafol had slightly less disease than those with all other treatments. This difference became much more apparent by August 1. On August 29, only the captafol-treated plots had acceptable disease levels, with indices ranging from 2.0 to 2.2. More than 50% of the plants were killed by an
Disease developed more rapidly in the plots treated at 14-day intervals. In July, the average disease index was 0.4 higher than that of the 7-day treatment. By 1 August, captafol clearly differed from all other treatments. However, by 29 August, no treatment applied on a 14-day schedule provided acceptable control of strawberry anthracnose. Disease indices ranged from 3.7 for captafol at 4.8 g a.i./L to 5.0 for the benomyl, maneb, and control treatments. Yields were markedly lower than those of the 7-day treatments, ranging from 30 to 78 plants per plot for captafol treatments and none to one plant per plot for all other treatments. These differences were attributed to rapid plant growth and an extended spray interval.
Disease development was slower in the spring and early summer of 1979 than in 1978 due to lower temperatures in June, which retarded plant growth and reduced yield. An extended wet period during Hurricane David favored disease development late in the growing season; however, the disease indices were higher in 1979 for identical treatments. Differences in disease among plots were very slight on 11 July and 1 August. Disease and yield on 11 and 29 September, respectively, were progressively worse with decreasing captafol concentration. Disease indices ranged from 2.0 to 3.0, and yield from 148 to 86 plants per plot for 4.8 and 1.2 g a.i./L, respectively. The captan plus benomyl mix was less effective than any captafol treatment, with a disease index 0.8 higher than the lowest rate of captafol, but the yield was more than twice that of captan or benomyl alone. Although this difference was not statistically significant, the higher degree of control was consistently evident from field observations.
Captafol was the most active material against C. fragariae in laboratory and field tests. It performed well even under epidemic conditions if applied in appropriate concentrations. Adequate control of strawberry anthracnose is provided by 1.2-2.4 g a.i./L applied every 7 days. The mixture of captan plus benomyl at 2.4 and 0.6 g a.i./L, respectively, also provides some control. Since Benlate has not been used extensively in commercial strawberry fields for 2-3 years, it is possible that the population of the resistant strain has decreased. If this is the case, the mixture would combine the high activity of captan with the continuous protection of a systemic. In this study, however, captafol was much more

ABSTRACT
GRAY, F. A., R. L. HAALAND, E. M. CLARK, and D. M. BALL. 1980. Diseases of alfalfa in Alabama. Plant Disease 64:1015-1017. A three-year survey of fields in Alabama showed several diseases associated with declining stands of mature alfalfa (Medicago sativa). These include anthracnose (Colletotrichum trifolii), Sclerotinia crown and stem rot (Sclerotinia trifoliorum), Rhizoctonia crown rot (Rhizoctonia solani), summer black stem and leaf spot (Cercospora medicaginis), charcoal rot (Macrophomina phaseolina), and the alfalfa stem nematode (Ditylenchus dipsaci). Rust (Uromyces striatus) severely damaged a seedling stand of alfalfa. Rhizoctonia crown rot, charcoal rot, and the alfalfa stem nematode are reported from the state for the first time. Eleven of 15 isolates of R. solani fro
Acreage rapidly declined for alfalfa production, which became essentially nonexistent by the late 1950s. However, since 1975, the acreage planted in alfalfa has steadily increased to an estimated current total of 1,200 hectares, with more planned for production. Alfalfa is attacked by at least 70 different pathogens, of which approximately 30 are considered to limit its production significantly.
