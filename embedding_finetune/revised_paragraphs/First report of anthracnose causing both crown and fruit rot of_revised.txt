First Report of Anthracnose Crown Rot of Strawberry Caused by Colletotrichum siamense in Rajshahi District of Bangladesh
This article discusses the first documented case of anthracnose crown rot affecting strawberries in the Rajshahi District of Bangladesh. The disease is caused by the pathogen Colletotrichum siamense, which poses a significant threat to strawberry cultivation in the region.
In September 2018, researchers published findings in Plant Disease, highlighting the emergence of this disease and its implications for local agriculture. The study details the symptoms observed in affected strawberry plants, as well as the environmental conditions that may have contributed to the outbreak.
The authors involved in this research include ten contributors with diverse backgrounds in agricultural science, contributing to a total of 97 publications among them. The study has garnered attention within the scientific community, evidenced by its citations and readership statistics.
Overall, the report emphasizes the need for increased awareness and management strategies to mitigate the impact of Colletotrichum siamense on strawberry crops in Bangladesh.

The small fruit crop, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA. It has gained remarkable acceptance from both growers and consumers. However, with the expansion of acreage, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) disease is posing a significant challenge to strawberry growers. In March 2016, typical ACR symptoms were observed on the strawberry cultivar 'Strawberry Festival' in a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were evident on approximately 10% of the plants and included flagging of young leaves, mimicking a lack of water, and wilting of the entire plant in the heat of the day. A lengthwise cut through the crown of diseased plants showed characteristic shades of red and white marbling. Crowns of seven symptomatic strawberry plants were obtained after excising foliage and roots and were washed under running water for one hour. The crowns were then surface disinfected with 70% ethanol followed by 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 and 3 minutes, respectively. Small pieces (2 mm × 2 mm) of the internal infected marbled red-colored tissues were cut with a sterile scalpel and placed on Corn Meal Agar medium, and incubated for 7 days at 25°C. Conidia grown on tissue pieces and hyphal mats emerging from the tissues were streaked on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates to obtain single conidial colonies. Two of the single-conidial isolates (BRSP08 and BRSP09) that had white margins with circular, dull orange centers were selected to prove Koch's postulates. The average mycelial growth rate was 9.8 mm per day at 25°C on PDA, characterized by cottony aerial growth and pale yellowish to pinkish color. Conidia were hyaline, cylindrical with round ends, measuring 14.90 - 18.19 µm × 4.05 - 6.20 µm (average ± SD, 16.22 ± 1.20 × 5.90 ± 0.84 µm, n = 30). Appressoria were brown, globose to cylindrical, lobed, and measured 7.50 - 12.70 × 6.08 - 8.4 µm (average ± SD, 10.72 ± 1.30 µm × 7.20 ± 0.80 µm, n = 20). The morphological characteristics of these isolates are consistent with some Colletotrichum species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, including C. siamense. Isolate BRSP09 was used for molecular identification. Internal transcribed spacer regions and the intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS), along with genes encoding chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the Apn2–Mat1–2 intergenic spacer and partial mating type (Mat1–2) gene (ApMat) of the selected isolate (BRSP09) were amplified using specific primers.
Sequencing of the purified Polymerase Chain Reaction products was performed by Macrogen Inc., Korea, and the sequences were deposited in GenBank (accession Nos. LC420017 - LC420022). Neighbor-joining and maximum likelihood phylogenetic trees were inferred using MEGA (Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis) v. 6.0 (Tamura et al. 2013) based on the multilocus alignment (ITS, TUB2, ACT, CHS-1, CAL, and ApMat) of the present isolate and related Colletotrichum spp. sequences previously deposited in GenBank. BLAST search and phylogenetic analysis revealed that the isolate BRSP09 from ‘Strawberry Festival’ is C. siamense (Appendix 1c-d) (Mills et al. 1992). To confirm the pathogenicity of the fungus, ten three-month-old tissue-cultured ‘Strawberry Festival’ plants were inoculated by dipping the roots and crowns into either 300 ml of conidial suspension (with 8 × 10^6 conidia/ml) of the isolates BRSP08 and BRSP09 or into sterile distilled water (control) for 30 minutes. The inoculated plants were transplanted into plastic pots with an artificial peat-based soil mix and maintained in the greenhouse at 28°C during the day and 20°C at night. The experiment was conducted twice. After four weeks, all plants inoculated with isolates BRSP08 or BRSP09 were stunted and developed typical wilt symptoms similar to those observed in the field (Appendix 1c), while the control plants remained healthy. C. siamense was re-isolated from crown tissues with typical anthracnose crown rot symptoms and identified using the morphological and molecular methods mentioned above, fulfilling Koch’s postulates. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report of anthracnose crown rot of strawberry caused by C. siamense, a member of the C. siamense complex in the Rajshahi District of Bangladesh.

Appendix 1a describes anthracnose disease symptoms observed in two naturally infected strawberry plants (A, B, E, and F) of the ‘Strawberry Festival’ cultivar. It also includes images of mycelial growth with perithecia (C and G), conidia (D, H, and I), and appressoria (J) of Colletotrichum siamense isolates on PDA medium, specifically showing BRSP08 in C and D, and BRSP09 in G, H, I, and J. Appendix 1b features a healthy plant inoculated with the conidial suspension of the isolated anthracnose pathogen, illustrating the characteristic wilt symptoms. Image A shows a healthy plant before treatment with conidial suspension BRSP08, while B depicts a wilted plant due to inoculation with the same isolate, and C shows a healthy plant before treatment.
