Colletotrichum crown rot of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) can be caused by any of three fungi: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata), C. fragariae, or C. acutatum. The closely related species C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides produce a reddish-brown necrosis of crown tissue following infection, causing plants to wilt and collapse. Under greenhouse conditions or in summer nurseries, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides may also produce necroses on stolons, lesions on fruit, or black leaf spots. Although C. acutatum can also cause crown rot, the disease symptoms in plants infected with this species are distinct from those produced by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides. Furthermore, where C. acutatum co-occurs with C. gloeosporioides in Florida, it is infrequently isolated from diseased crowns. Crown rot is a serious disease in subtropical strawberry production regions such as those in the southeastern United States, as infection by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides is favored by warm, moist conditions. Although crown rot is observed in fields during the winter production season, it is most severe in summer nurseries in the southeast and is one of the primary reasons that transplants are produced in temperate regions.
There is some uncertainty regarding the initial occurrence of the closely related pathogens C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides in Florida and historically which of these species was responsible for epidemics in the region. C. fragariae was first reported in Florida nurseries by Brooks in 1935. The first description of crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides or its teleomorph Glomerella cingulata was reported in 1984. The isolates in this report were homothallic and thus described as G. cingulata. Subsequently, a portion of the historical isolates from Florida previously described as C. fragariae were reclassified as C. gloeosporioides based on conidial and setal morphology. This suggests that C. gloeosporioides may have contributed to crown rot epidemics prior to the initial report in 1984 but was misidentified as C. fragariae. At least two of the reclassified isolates produced fertile perithecia when grown together in culture, indicating that they were heterothallic.
Several of the reclassified isolates have been characterized using molecular methods, and in addition to being distinct from C.
Previous studies examining variation in strawberry resistance to C. fragariae found a broad range of susceptibility among cultivars and aggressiveness among isolates. One study identified a significant cultivar by isolate interaction. Host resistance studies using homothallic G. cingulata isolates were less conclusive, as they included only two or three isolates. Another study observed significant variation in cultivar susceptibility and isolate aggressiveness, along with a significant cultivar by isolate interaction. In a later study using a different set of isolates, only cultivar susceptibility varied. For C. acutatum, a specific interaction between strawberry cultivars and isolates was noted, with a single dominant gene appearing to be responsible for this interaction. Isolates either showed an incompatible reaction with cultivars carrying this gene or an intermediate degree of compatibility. Assays used to evaluate resistance to C. fragariae and C. acutatum were based on symptom development on petioles or foliage and did not assess the ability of plants to resist necrosis of crown tissue. Variation in cultivar susceptibility to C. gloeosporioides isolates from Florida has not been thoroughly investigated. In this study, we examined the levels of resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides in cultivars commonly grown in Florida, as well as the patterns of virulence and aggressiveness among C. gloeosporioides isolates under field conditions. This study generated information useful for breeders regarding the mechanisms and sources of resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides. It is also valuable for growers deciding which cultivars to plant and from which nursery locations to purchase plants, as losses due to crown rot could be especially severe for susceptible cultivars propagated in local Florida nurseries where the disease is most prevalent.
In field experiments over three seasons, isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and native grape were tested for virulence on strawberry cultivars. Isolate aggressiveness and cultivar resistance were determined by the proportion of plants killed at a specified time. Each year, four to six isolates were inoculated on four to seven different cultivars, with a subset of isolates and cultivars evaluated again the following season. On evaluation dates, disease incidence ranged from 10% to 84% for individual cultivars. Cultivar and isolate effects were significant in all three seasons, but no significant cultivar by isolate interaction was found in any season, indicating that resistance to C. gloeosporioides is nonspecific. In the third season, one isolate of Colletotrichum fragariae from strawberry and one from oak were included. While there were significant differences among cultivars and isolates, no significant cultivar by isolate interaction was detected for this species. When comparing the resistance of cultivars to both species, the rankings were similar, but a modest cultivar by species interaction was noted. The cultivar Treasure exhibited greater resistance to crown rot caused by either species than any other cultivar tested.
Plant materials and cultivation. Four to seven cultivars were selected from those commercially available as leaf-on, bareroot transplants imported from Canada at the beginning of the 2001–2002, 2002–2003, and 2003–2004 seasons. The cultivars used included standard cultivars in the industry, several new cultivars, and an advanced selection from the Florida Agricultural Experiment Station breeding program. The cultivars Aromas, Camarosa, Gaviota, and Camino Real were developed at the University of California; ‘Carmine,’ ‘Earlibrite,’ ‘Strawberry Festival,’ ‘Sweet Charlie,’ and FL 99-164 are cultivars or selections developed at the University of Florida. The cultivar Treasure is from J & P Research in Naples, FL. The cultivar Camarosa was previously shown to be susceptible to crown rot and was included as a positive control for all three seasons. Plants were grown on raised, plastic mulch-covered beds 71 cm wide, 15 cm high at the edge, and 18 cm high in the center. Each bed contained two rows of strawberry plants with 30.5 cm spacing between rows and 38 cm spacing between plants within the rows. The distance between bed centers was 1.22 m. Before planting, the beds were fumigated with methyl bromide/chloropicrin (98:2) at 350 kg/ha. Leaf-on, bareroot transplants were set on 18 October for the 2001–2002 season, 16 October for the 2002–2003 season, and 29 October for the 2003–2004 season. Plants were overhead irrigated for 10 to 12 days to facilitate establishment. After establishment, water and fertilizer were provided through drip tape. Weekly applications of Captan 80WP (Micro Flo, Memphis, TN; n-trichloromethylthio-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboximide) at 4.2 kg/ha were begun two weeks after plants were inoculated. This fungicide prevents new crown infections without inhibiting the progress of infections already established and was used to prevent inoculum spread from collapsed crowns to adjacent plots. Freeze and frost protection was provided by overhead sprinklers when necessary.
Fungal isolates and inoculation procedure. Strawberry crown isolates were obtained from samples submitted to the diagnostic clinic at the University of Florida Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Dover. During the 2002–2003 season, an isolate from a lesion on wild grape (Vitis rotundifolia) was included, and an ascospore isolate from a perithecium emerging from a strawberry petiole was included during the 2003–2004 season. The isolates were identified as C. gloeosporioides using a species-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region primer and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Briefly, a species-specific ITS primer that produces a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product from C. gloeosporioides or C. fragariae template DNA was used for initial species identification. Subsequently, bands from five RAPD primer amplification reactions were scored for each isolate. Based on RAPD banding patterns, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates fell into two distinct clusters. All C. gloeosporioides isolates were in the same cluster, yet had distinct RAPD banding patterns from one another, indicating that they were not vegetatively produced from the same parent strain. Isolates were also obtained from seven cultivars to reduce the chance of oversampling a race that might be selected for on a specific cultivar. Pathogenicity of isolates to strawberry was confirmed by injecting inoculum into crown tissue of greenhouse-grown strawberry plants prior to being used in field experiments. Four to six C. gloeosporioides isola
Inoculum was prepared from 6- to 8-day-old cultures grown under continuous fluorescent light at 24°C on potato dextrose agar. Conidial suspensions used for inoculations were prepared in sterile deionized water, filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and diluted to 5 × 10^5 conidia/ml. Inoculations were performed by spraying 2 ml of conidial suspension with a hand mister directly into the crown of plants 15 to 17 days after the plants were set in the field. The inoculation dates were 2 November 2001 for the 2001–2002 season, 31 October 2002 for the 2002–2003 season, and 15 November 2003 for the 2003–2004 season.
The experimental design and statistical analysis involved a two-factor complete block. There were four blocks in each experiment. Blocks consisted of a single 73-m bed for the 2001–2002 season or two parallel 73- to 76-m beds for the 2002–2003 and 2003–2004 seasons. All cultivar-isolate combinations were randomly assigned to 10-plant plots within each block along with one uninoculated plot of each cultivar. After inoculation, the number of collapsed plants within each bed was recorded weekly until the experiment was terminated at the end of the growing season. The experiments were terminated 133 days (15 March 2002) after inoculation for the 2001–2002 season, 148 days (28 March 2003) after inoculation for the 2002–2003 season, and 132 days (26 March 2004) after inoculation for the 2003–2004 season. Data used for statistical analysis included the proportion of collapsed plants in each plot on specified dates, transformed to the arcsine square root. The formula for the transformation was arcsin{sqrt[(y + ⅜)/(n + ¾)]}, where y = the number of collapsed plants per plot and n = the total number of plants per plot. Data for each season were analyzed separately using PROC MIXED of SAS.
The table provided detailed descriptions of Colletotrichum isolates used for inoculations over three seasons in Dover, FL. It included information on species, isolate designation, host cultivar, tissue type, collection site (FL) and year, and the season used for each isolate. Key isolates included various strains of C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae, along with their corresponding host plants and collection details, highlighting the diversity of isolates employed across the experimental seasons.
In the analysis using C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae data alone, "block" was considered a random effect, while "cultivar" and "isolate" were treated as fixed effects. In the analysis where both species data were combined, "species," "isolate," and "cultivar" were all considered fixed effects, with "isolate" nested within "species." Block was regarded as a random effect. Uninoculated plots were excluded from any reported analysis. The risk of type I error (α) was set at 0.05 for least square means t-tests comparing transformed disease incidence between cultivars, without adjustment for multiple comparisons.
RESULTS
Visually comparing graphs of plant mortality over time after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides revealed that the pattern of symptom development was different during the three seasons. During the 2001–2002 season, the majority of plants that developed crown rot symptoms did so in the first 55 days after inoculation. For the 2002–2003 season, rapid plant collapse within this time period only occurred for ‘Gaviota’ and ‘Camarosa’. During this season, the rate at which plants developed symptoms slowed between day 50 and day 130 after inoculation. However, unlike the 2001–2002 season, in which the progress of symptom development also slowed, there was a spike in plant death late in the season. For the 2003–2004 season, symptoms developed on plants throughout the season for all of the cultivars tested. At each time point, the rankings of plants with respect to susceptibility were approximately the same. However, some cultivars, such as Earlibrite in the 2002–2003 season, Strawberry Festival in the 2003–2004 season, and FL 99-164 in the 2003–2004 season, initially had relatively low disease incidence that increased at a faster rate relative to other cultivars toward the end of the season. Only ‘Camarosa’ was examined for susceptibility to C. gloeosporioides in all three seasons. At the end of each season, the incidence of plant collapse for this cultivar was consistently high, ranging from 62% to 84%. Plants wer

F values for the 2001-2002 season were calculated using a residual variance estimate equal to 0.024 with 69 degrees of freedom. F values for the 2002-2003 season were calculated using a residual variance estimate equal to 0.038 with 123 degrees of freedom. F values for the 2003-2004 season were calculated using a residual variance estimate equal to 0.035 with 69 degrees of freedom.
Mean percent mortality for strawberry cultivars was calculated at weekly intervals over the growing season using data from all isolates. Plants inoculated with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides during the 2001–2002 season were labeled as A, while those inoculated during the 2002–2003 season were labeled as B, and plants inoculated during the 2003–2004 season were labeled as C. Additionally, plants inoculated with C. fragariae during the 2003–2004 season were labeled as D. Arrows indicate the time points where disease incidence data were used for statistical analysis.
All cultivars except ‘Gaviota’, FL 99 164, ‘Carmine’, and ‘Camino Real’ were tested in at least two seasons. Eight of the C. gloeosporioides isolates were used for inoculations in one season, and four isolates (97-45A, 97-63, 98-285, 00-59) were used in two. During the 2001–2002 season, ‘Camarosa’ was the most susceptible cultivar, followed by ‘Aromas’. ‘Earlibrite’ and ‘Sweet Charlie’ were more resistant and had essentially the same level of susceptibility. The ranking of these cultivars for the 2002–2003 season was the same as for 2001–2002, although statistically ‘Aromas’ could not be separated from ‘Earlibrite’. In the 2002–2003 season, ‘Treasure’, ‘Strawberry Festival’, and ‘Gaviota’ were also evaluated. ‘Treasure’ was more resistant, and ‘Gaviota’ was more susceptible than any of the other cultivars examined. ‘Strawberry
The rankings of these isolates with respect to one another remained consistent, although in the second season, isolates 98-285 and 97-63 were not significantly different from each other. Isolates 00-59 and 96-83R were highly aggressive, while isolate 96-83H, a non-strawberry isolate, was the least aggressive isolate examined. For the 2003–2004 season, only isolate 00-59 was re-evaluated, and it remained highly aggressive. Other isolates fell into two groups, with isolate 02-172 being more aggressive than isolate 96-15A and ascospore isolate 00-117. In separate analyses comparing inoculated plots to uninoculated controls, all isolate treatments exhibited significantly more crown rot than controls (data not shown).
Cultivar rankings for resistance to C. fragariae were very similar to those for C. gloeosporioides during the season when this species was included in the study. ‘Treasure’ was highly resistant to C. fragariae; FL 99-164 and ‘Carmine’ displayed moderate levels of resistance, while ‘Strawberry Festival’ and ‘Camarosa’ were relatively susceptible. The rankings differed slightly, as ‘Camino Real’ appeared more resistant and ‘Strawberry Festival’ more susceptible to C. gloeosporioides than to C. fragariae, although not dramatically so.
Only two C. fragariae isolates were included in the study, and they displayed different levels of aggressiveness: isolate 02-135, a C. fragariae isolate from a non-strawberry host, was more aggressive than C-16, the isolate from strawberry.
Pathogenicity trials conducted over three years using 12 distinct C. gloeosporioides isolates and 10 strawberry cultivars identified differences in disease resistance among cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among isolates, but failed to identify any cultivar by isolate interactions. A more limited study using two C. fragariae isolates inoculated on six strawberry cultivars during the third year identified differences in disease resistance among cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates, but again failed to reveal a cultivar by isolate interaction.
When cultivar resistance rankings were compared between the two pathogen species, there was a small but significant cultivar by species interaction. Horizontal resistance is effective against all isolates of a pathogen, whereas vertical resistance is effective against a subset of isolates. These terms are synonymous with race-non-specific and race-specific resistance, respectively. In pathosystems where race-specific resistance occurs, an incompatible interaction between the host and pathogen often requires a dominant host resistance gene and a dominant pathogen avirulence gene. Such interactions are described by the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Race-non-specific resistance is less understood but is believed to be governed by many host genes that incrementally contribute to the overall resistance of the plant. Vanderplank proposed using analysis of variance to determine the contribution of race-non-specific and/or race-specific resistance within a host population against a group of pathogen isolates. The absence of a cultivar by isolate interaction is evidence for race-non-specific resistance using this method. A cultivar by isolate interaction suggests that race-specific mechanisms contribute to the resistance observed within the host population, although deviations from additivity could be responsible for the statistical interaction. Deviations from additivity result from the scale used to measure resistance, whereas rank changes are consistent with physiological interdependency between the host and isolates. No cultivar by isolate interactions were detected in this study, suggesting that race-non-specific resistance mechanisms are responsible for the differences in resistance observed between cultivars. Using transformed percentages taken at a time point in which disease incidence was intermediate effectively reduced interactions attributable to deviations from additivity. This finding may be useful in examining resistance to other wilt diseases where the use of arbitrary rating scales or measurements of area under the disease progress curve may produce results in which there are no transformations available to eliminate undesirable scale effects. A drawback of measuring resistance using the proportion of collapsed plants is that the rankings of cultivars could change at different time points after inoculation, as resistance may occur at different levels of the infection process. Temporally distinct resistance mechanisms have been demonstrated for Phytophthora palmivora on cacao. The first level of resistance, referred to as penetration resistance, was attributed to morphological factors, and the second level of resistance, referred to as postpenetration resistance, impeded tissue invasion by the pathogen after colonization. In the current study, rank changes between cultivars over the course of the season were infrequent and occurred only between cultivars displaying similar levels of resistance, suggesting that sequential deployment of resistance mechanisms had little effect on the evaluation of cultivars. However, the relatively high levels of inoculum used could have saturated structural mechanisms that limit ingress into the host. Similarly, individual isolates within the pathogen population might differ in their ability to overcome plant defenses at different times during and after invasion of tissues. However, like the cultivar resistance rankings, pathogen aggressiveness rankings did not change over the course of the experiment.
In a study conducted in Dover, FL, mean percent plant collapse was measured for isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. fragariae inoculated on strawberry cultivars over three seasons (2001-2004). The results showed varying disease incidence percentages across the different seasons for each isolate, highlighting the
During the 2001–2002 season, crown rot symptoms appeared to progress faster early in the season than they did in the 2002–2003 or 2003–2004 seasons. This was probably due to higher early-season temperatures since the average daily temperature in December was 18.3°C, which is 3.7°C higher than it was in the other seasons. The mean daily temperature of 11.6°C in January of the 2002–2003 season was 2.5°C lower than the mean temperature during January for the other two seasons, which may have slowed down symptom development during this time period.
In a previous study examining resistance to G. cingulata and C. fragariae in strawberry, cultivar by isolate interactions were observed. The G. cingulata isolates used in that study were homothallic and therefore likely to have been from a genetically distinct subpopulation within the same taxonomic group as those used in the current study. Additionally, it is conceivable that scale effects produced by the severity rating system used to evaluate disease accounted for the interaction. However, the interactions may also have been due to the use of cultivars not included in the current study. Commercial cultivars shipped from Canada were used to obtain the relatively large number of plants free of crown rot required for the experiment. A disadvantage of using these cultivars for studying mechanisms of resistance was that some of them were closely related, restricting the diversity of the germplasm evaluated. For example, ‘Earlibrite’ and ‘Strawberry Festival’ share ‘Rosa Linda’ as a parent, while ‘Strawberry Festival’ and ‘Treasure’ share ‘Oso Grande’ as a parent.
Statistical tests were conducted on mean transformed disease incidences. Reported values were calculated by back-transforming the mean arcsine square root disease incidences for all cultivars inoculated with an isolate. Statistical tests only compare means for isolates of the same species within the same season. Means in each column followed by the same letter are not significantly different, as determined by least squares means t-tests (P = 0.05).
The mean percent plant collapse of cultivars inoculated with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or C. fragariae during three seasons in Dover, FL, indicates the disease incidence for each cultivar over the years. The results show that the 'Gaviota' cultivar had the highest mean collapse percentage across the seasons, while 'Treasure' consistently exhibited the lowest. Other cultivars like 'Camarosa' and 'Strawberry Festival' displayed varied collapse rates, emphasizing the differences in resistance among the cultivars evaluated.
Nevertheless, a great deal of variance in resistance was observed among them. It is also conceivable that strains with virulence patterns distinct from the isolates tested exist but were not sampled due to their low frequency within the population. The use of isolates from different cultivars or hosts, each with distinct RAPD banding patterns, should have enhanced the probability of finding these strains; however, given the high variability of C. gloeosporioides and the fact that only two C. fragariae isolates were used in the current study, we cannot conclude that a more extensive sample would not reveal isolates that react with cultivars differently. A cultivar-by-isolate interaction for resistance has been demonstrated for C. acutatum. A single dominant gene (Rca2) appears to be responsible for this interaction and distinguishes two groups of C. acutatum: those producing a noncompatible reaction with cultivars having Rca2 (group 2) and those with an intermediate degree of compatibility with cultivars possessing the Rca2 gene (group 1). Although C. acutatum is more distantly related to C. gloeosporioides than C. fragariae and produces different disease symptoms on strawberry, there is evidence that resistance to C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and G. cingulata is correlated. Cultivars that are at least moderately resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum examined in the current study include ‘Sweet Charlie,’ ‘Carmine,’ and ‘Earlibrite.’ ‘Sweet Charlie’ is field immune to fruit rot, whereas ‘Carmine’ and ‘Earlibrite’ are moderately resistant. Although the mechanism of resistance to C. acutatum in these cultivars has not been examined, it is likely that they possess at least one copy of a dominant resistance gene to group 2 C. acutatum isolates. A dominant resistance gene to this group of isolates was found in 13 of 14 cultivars from the United States and Europe classified as intermediately susceptible or resistant to anthracnose fruit rot, whereas it only occurred in one of seven cultivars classified as susceptible. Additionally, cultivars such as ‘Dover,’ which is homozygous for the Rca2 gene, and ‘Sequoia,’ which is heterozygous for the Rca2 gene, occur in the pedigrees of the three fruit rot-resistant cultivars used in the current study. With the exception of ‘Treasure,’ no cultivar displayed significantly greater resistance to crown rot than ‘Sweet Charlie,’ ‘Earlibrite,’ and ‘Carmine,’ suggesting that major gene resistance to C. acutatum could also be effective against C. gloeosporioides. The lack of a cultivar-by-isolate interaction observed with isolates of C. gloeosporioides could be due to little variation in a gene product or products in this species homologous to those responsible for the interaction with C. acutatum. It is also important to note that ‘Treasure’ was found to be highly susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum in field trials conducted over two years, indicating t
Race-specific resistance is found most frequently in biotrophic plant-microbe interactions where there is prolonged contact between the pathogen and the living host. Colletotrichum species employ nutritional strategies ranging from necrotrophy to hemibiotrophy. Species such as C. orbiculare, C. graminicola, C. sublineolum, C. destructivum, C. truncatum, and C. linicola are all considered hemibiotrophs, as there is an asymptomatic biotrophic interaction between these species and host cells before the reaction becomes necrotrophic. The occurrence of several dominant race-specific resistance genes in beans to C. lindemuthianum, a member of the C. orbiculare species aggregate, suggests that gene-for-gene interactions play an important role in host resistance to these hemibiotrophic pathogens.
No microscopic studies of strawberry crown invasion by C. gloeosporioides have been conducted, although invasion of subtropical fruits, northern jointvetch, and Stylosanthes scabra by C. gloeosporioides has been investigated. On citrus and avocado fruit, C. gloeosporioides acts as a quiescent epiphyte that can become necrotrophic upon ripening of the fruit. On the foliage of S. scabra and northern jointvetch, C. gloeosporioides has a brief biotrophic phase before entering an extended necrotrophic stage. The evidence for this biotrophic interaction is not as clear as it is for interactions between Colletotrichum species commonly referred to as hemibiotrophs and is limited to the occurrence of a spherical vesicle inside an epidermal cell just beneath the appressorium, from which infection hyphae emanate. A differential interaction between S. scabra cultivars and biotype A C. gloeosporioides isolates has also been demonstrated, although much of the variation in resistance among cultivars is due to race-non-specific mechanisms.
The histopathology of infections caused by the related pathogen, C. fragariae, on strawberry stolons showed that a brief biotrophic phase possibly occurred before the pathogen entered an extended necrotrophic phase. This biotrophic phase was less than 12 hours and was considered a modification of necrotrophy rather than an example of hemibiotrophy. The lack of race-specific resistance observed in the current study suggests that the biotrophic interaction between C. gloeosporioides or C. fragariae and strawberry is brief and limited. This finding is also consistent with evidence that both of these species infect hosts unrelated to strawberry. An isolate of C. gloeosporioides from grape, a C. gloeosporioides ascospore isolate from a strawberry petiole, and an isolate of C. fragariae from oak were included in this study. The ascospore isolate has a different RAPD profile from other isolates obtained from the same perithecium from which it was isolated and only produces fertile perithecia in culture when paired with a second isolate, indicating that it is heterothallic. In an analysis of RAPD marker data, the ascospore and grape C. gloeosporioides isolates grouped with the C. gloeosporioides population from crown tissue, while the C. fragariae oak isolate grouped with the C. fragariae population from strawberry. The ascospore isolate was one of the least aggressive isolates during the 2003–2
Race-specific resistance is found most frequently in biotrophic plant-microbe interactions where there is prolonged contact between the pathogen and the living host. Colletotrichum species use nutritional strategies ranging from necrotrophy to hemibiotrophy. Colletotrichum species such as C. orbiculare, C. graminicola, C. sublineolum, C. destructivum, C. truncatum, and C. linicola are all considered hemibiotrophs, as there is an asymptomatic biotrophic interaction between these species and host cells before the reaction becomes necrotrophic. The occurrence of several dominant race-specific resistance genes in beans to C. lindemuthianum, a member of the C. orbiculare species aggregate, suggests that gene-for-gene interactions play an important role in host resistance to these hemibiotrophic pathogens.

The evidence for this biotrophic interaction is not as clear as it is for interactions between Colletotrichum spp., commonly referred to as hemibiotrophs, and is limited to the occurrence of a spherical vesicle inside an epidermal cell just beneath the appressorium from which infection hyphae emanate. A differential interaction between S. scabra cultivars and biotype A C. gloeosporioides isolates has also been demonstrated, although much of the variation in resistance among cultivars is due to race-non-specific mechanisms.

This finding is also consistent with evidence that both of these species infect hosts unrelated to strawberry.
An isolate of C. gloeosporioides from grape, a C. gloeosporioides ascospore isolate from a strawberry petiole, and an isolate of C. fragariae from oak were included in this study. The ascospore isolate has a different RAPD profile from other isolates obtained from the same perithecium from which it was isolated, and it only prod
The C. fragariae isolate from oak was more aggressive and had essentially the same virulence pattern as the isolate from strawberry. This provides further evidence that C. fragariae from strawberry is derived from a population with a very broad host range, as the oak isolate was found 28 km from any strawberry production area. The only interaction detected was between the species of isolate and cultivar. This interaction was minor, with only one rank change occurring between cultivars. Although further studies should be conducted to confirm this finding, it suggests that resistance to C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae is positively correlated, indicating that there are also differences in the mechanisms of resistance to these two species.
Information obtained from the current study could enhance the efficiency of germplasm screens and assist in progenitor selection. For future screenings of strawberry plants for resistance to C. gloeosporioides isolates from Florida, the absence of a cultivar by isolate interaction suggests that using numerous isolates may not be necessary. Although the virulence patterns of the isolate collection used in this study were consistent, differences in aggressiveness among isolates were noted. A potentially beneficial strategy for isolate selection in future screens could involve using a combination of isolates with varying levels of aggressiveness. This approach allows less aggressive isolates to differentiate between genotypes with low or moderate resistance, while aggressive isolates can be employed to differentiate resistant cultivars.
The study was not designed to determine if resistance in ‘Treasure’ is controlled by a major gene; however, information from the pedigrees of ‘Treasure’ and ‘Strawberry Festival’ suggests that it may be. Both cultivars share ‘Oso Grande’ as a parent but exhibit very different levels of resistance to crown rot. The presence of a major gene or genes for resistance to crown rot in ‘Treasure’ could explain this difference, although appropriate crosses would need to be conducted to confirm this hypothesis. Furthermore, since ‘Treasure’ is not resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, the resistance is likely distinct from that conferred by the Rca2 gene.
The observation that some disease was detected in all of the tested cultivars has important implications for disease control strategies. Given that C. gloeosporioides is widely distributed on multiple hosts in Florida, a portion of plants from any cultivar is likely to become infected, with crowns infected by more aggressive isolates showing symptoms. Utilizing resistant cultivars would likely reduce the spread of disease among strawberry plants.
