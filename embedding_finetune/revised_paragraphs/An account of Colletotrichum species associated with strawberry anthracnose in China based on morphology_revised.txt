Abstract
Strawberry anthracnose is an important disease in China that results in significant economic losses. Several Colletotrichum species are known pathogens of strawberry. A survey of strawberry fields in eight provinces of China was conducted to identify the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. The disease primarily causes crown rot, leading to plant wilt and death during the nursery stage after transplanting in greenhouses, making anthracnose a major threat to strawberry production and quality. Multi-locus sequence analysis combined with morphological assessment revealed that the disease-associated taxa belong to two Colletotrichum species complexes: Colletotrichum nymphaeae (acutatum species complex), C. fructicola, and C. changpingense sp. nov. (gloeosporioides species complex). The novel species is introduced and illustrated in this paper. It is closely related to C. theobromicola, and pathogenicity tests confirmed its pathogenicity to the strawberry crown, fruits, and leaves.
Keywords – C. nymphaeae – crown rot – molecular phylogeny – morphology – pathogen
Introduction
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China. Strawberry production has expanded rapidly in recent years, making China one of the world’s largest strawberry producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation occupied 100.5 × 10^3 ha with a yield of 2.8 million tonnes. With increased production, many fungal diseases have become a significant problem in strawberry farming, r
Colletotrichum is one of the most important plant pathogenic genera worldwide, occurring predominantly in tropical and subtropical regions on a wide range of crops. A summary of names and a review of the confusion with names in the genus helped to initiate a series of studies that utilized molecular phylogeny and morphology to define species within the genus. Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum species, is a major disease affecting strawberry production globally. Colletotrichum species infect all plant parts, causing serious crown rot, irregular leaf spots, necrotic lesions on the petioles and runners, as well as black spots on the fruits. Anthracnose can lead to up to 80% plant death in nurseries and over 50% yield losses in strawberry fields. Accurate pathogen identification is crucial for the successful implementation of any resistance breeding and disease management program.
Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990. A subsequent report identified the pathogen as C. acutatum, while other studies identified C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characters. It was concluded that these three species are the primary pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease problem in many strawberry-producing areas in China. In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded. In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang city, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot. The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011. However, most studies in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphology and single-gene analysis. Due to overlapping characters, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. The use of multi-gene analysis combined with morphology can provide better resolution. Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose in China using both morphological and multi-gene approaches.
Materials and Methods
Samples showing anthracnose symptoms were collected from various locations in China during 2011–2014. To promote fungal development and facilitate isolation, samples were incubated in a clean polythene bag with sterilized tissue dipped in distilled water. Samples were surface sterilized in 3.5% sodium hypochlorite for 1–2 minutes and then rinsed three times in sterilized water before culturing on
All microscopic measurements were made with AxioVision v4.8, and images used for figures were processed with Adobe Photoshop CS3 Extended version 10.0 software. Facesoffungi and Index Fungorum numbers are provided (Jayasiri et al. 2015; Index Fungorum 2016).
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and DNA sequencing involved the extraction of total genomic DNA using a modified protocol from Damm et al. (2008). Fresh mycelium (500 mg) was scraped from the margin of a colony on a PDA plate incubated at 28 °C for 7–10 days. The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene, along with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), actin (ACT), and β-tubulin genes were amplified using specific primer pairs: ITS1/ITS4 (White et al. 1990), GDF/GDR (Templeton et al. 1992), CHS79F/CHS345R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), ACT512F/ACT783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), and BT1/BT2 (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997). PCR was performed in a BIORAD 1000 Thermal Cycler with a total volume of 25 μl. Each PCR mixture contained 0.3 μl of TaKaRa Ex-Taq DNA polymerase, 12.5 μl of 2× PCR buffer, 2.5 μl of dNTPs, 1 μl of each primer, 9.2 μl of double-distilled water, and 100–500 ng of DNA template. The thermal cycling program followed that reported in Weir et al. (2012). The PCR products were visualized by staining with ethidium bromide on 1.2% agarose electrophoresis gels and purified according to the manufacturer’s instructions of a Qiagen purification kit. DNA sequencing of the genes was conducted by Sunbiotech Company Ltd., Beijing, China. The sequence data from this study are placed in GenBank.
For phylogenetic analysis, consensus sequences from the sequences generated from forward and reverse primers were obtained using DNAStar v.5.1 and SeqMan v.5.00. A combined dataset of the five gene regions was prepared using Clustal X1.81. Further alignment of sequences was achieved using default settings in MAFFT v.7, and manual adjustments were conducted using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 where necessary. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed for the acutatum species complex and the gloeosporioides species complex. Maximum Parsimony analysis (MP) was performed using PAUP v. 4.0b10 to obtain the most parsimonious trees. Gaps were treated as missing data, and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were set to 5,000, branches of zero length were collapsed, and all multiple pa
ACT were incorporated into the analysis. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100th generation. The 2,000 trees representing the burn-in phase of the analyses were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used for calculating posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree. The alignments and trees are deposited in TreeBASE under accession number S20238. The fungal strains used for the phylogenetic analysis in this study are listed in Table 1.
Genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) analysis was conducted to analyze new species and their most closely related species. A pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test was performed in SplitsTree4 to determine the level of recombination within phylogenetically closely related species, using a five-locus 1,150 concatenated dataset for C. changpingense and its related species. If the pairwise homoplasy index is below a 0.05 threshold (Фw < 0.05), it indicates significant recombination present in the dataset. The relationships between closely related species were visualized by constructing a split graph, using both the LogDet transformation and splits decomposition options.
To test the pathogenicity of the new species, detached fruits and leaves inoculations were conducted. Additionally, seedling inoculations were performed to determine whether this new species can infect the rhizome (crown).
For the detached fruits and leaves inoculation, healthy strawberry fruits, leaves, and seedlings were used. Fruits and leaves were surface sterilized with 75% ethanol and washed three times with distilled water. Fifteen leaves and 15 fruits per isolate were wounded with a sterilized insect needle, while another 15 leaves and 15 fruits remained non-wounded. A conidial suspension (10^5/mL, adjusted using a hemocytometer) was applied to the wounded and non-wounded fruits and uniformly sprayed onto the leaves. Control fruits and leaves were inoculated with sterilized water. The inoculated fruits and leaves, along with the controls, were placed in a plastic box covered with plastic film and incubated at 25 °C.
For seedling and rhizome inoculation, 30 strawberry seedlings planted in plastic pots were inoculated with spore suspension. Each seedling was planted in one pot, and 100 mL of spore suspension was added. Control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized water. The inoculated seedlings and controls were kept in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a 12-hour day/night cycle.
Colletotrichum species were isolated from strawber
Weir et al. (2012), Sharma et al. (2013), Yan et al. (2015), and Diao et al. (2017) constructed a single phylogenetic tree for all Colletotrichum strains, incorporating our sequence data using five combined gene alignments. This tree was compared with the backbone tree presented in Hyde et al. (2014), focusing on the acutatum and gloeosporioides species complexes. Consequently, two separate phylogenetic trees were created for these complexes. The maximum-parsimony and Bayesian inference methods yielded nearly identical topologies, although the Bayesian trees are not displayed.
The combined gene alignment for the acutatum complex included 37 taxa and 1,712 characters, with C. orchidophilum as the outgroup taxon. Parsimony analysis revealed that 1,249 characters were constant, 229 were variable but uninformative, and 234 were parsimony-informative. The analysis resulted in a single most parsimonious tree (TL = 689, CI = 0.729, RI = 0.820, RC = 0.597, HI = 0.271). Five isolates (SA0017, SA0024, SA0041, SA0069, and SA0070) clustered closely with C. nymphaeae, demonstrating strong support.
The combined gene alignment for the gloeosporioides complex consisted of 52 taxa and 1,932 characters, with C. boninense as the outgroup taxon. Parsimony analysis indicated that 1,350 characters were constant, 318 were variable but uninformative, and 264 were parsimony-informative. This analysis resulted in 100 most parsimonious trees; one of them (TL = 1,040, CI = 0.696, RI = 0.779, RC = 0.542, HI = 0.304) showed that 15 isolates obtained in this study clustered together with C. fructicola, receiving high support. Additionally, isolates SA0016 and SA0050 were identified as sister to the clade containing C. grevilleae, C. grossum, and C. theobromicola, also with high support (100/1.00).
In pathogenicity studies involving detached fruit and leaf inoculation, all inoculated leaves and fruits exhibited symptoms after 72 hours. Symptoms on wounde

Taxonomy
Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast., L. Cai & K.D. Hyde was originally reported from coffee berries in Thailand and has a wide host range. It belongs to the gloeosporioides species complex and has been reported from Canada and the USA, causing strawberry anthracnose. In this study, fifteen strains were isolated from strawberries: one strain from a fruit, two from petioles, eleven from rhizomes, and one from a stolon. The phylogram shows our strains clustered with C. fructicola (ICMP 18581) with 99% bootstrap support and posterior probability values of 1.00.
Colletotrichum nymphaeae (Pass.) Aa. has a broad host range and belongs to the acutatum species complex. It has been recorded from several countries including Bulgaria, Canada, France, Israel, Italy, Kenya, the Netherlands, South Africa, Spain, Switzerland, the UK, and the USA, where it causes strawberry anthracnose. Five strains were isolated from strawberries: two from fruits, two from petioles, and one from a stolon. The phylogram indicates our strains clustered with C. nymphaeae (CBS515.78) with 100% bootstrap support and posterior probability values of 1.00.
Colletotrichum changpingense G. Zhang, Jayawardena & K.D. Hyde, sp. nov. is named after the locality where it was found. The holotype is MFLU 15-0212. This pathogen affects strawberry rhizomes, with colonies growing from single conidia on PDA being white, with a black center and pale yellow-gray edges, reaching a maximum diameter of 78 mm in 7 days at 28 ºC, with a gro
Notes – Based on multi-locus sequence data (ACT, CHS, GAPDH, ITS, and β-tubulin), C. changpingense is phylogenetically closely related to C. grevilleae, C. grossum, and C. theobromicola. Sequence data derived from the ITS region does not separate C. changpingense from C. grevilleae, C. theobromicola, and C. grossum. The BLASTn search with the ITS sequence of this strain showed 100% similarity to C. gloeosporioides isolate JX573319. The closest match in a BLASTn search in GenBank with the GAPDH sequence was C. theobromicola strain JX009957, with 99% similarity. The closest matches in a BLASTn search in GenBank with the CHS sequence was C. siamense strain KF772060, with 97% similarity, and with the ACT sequence was C. siamense strain KT936435, with 99% similarity. The BLASTn search with the β-tubulin sequence was identical to C. grossum (CAUG7, KP890171) and C. theobromicola (C1273, JX010382). Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. grevilleae by 17 bp changes in ACT, 11 bp changes in CHS, 6 bp changes in GAPDH, and 8 bp changes in ITS. Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. theobromicola by 17 bp changes in ACT, 12 bp changes in CHS, 2 bp changes in GAPDH, 9 bp changes in ITS, and 8 bp changes in β-tubulin. Colletotrichum changpingense differs from the type strain of C. grossum by 18 bp changes in ACT, 9 bp changes in CHS, and 5 bp changes in GAPDH. Therefore, C. changpingense provides sufficient data to be classified as a new species. A PHI test revealed no significant recombination events between C. changpingense and its closely related taxa.
Discussion – Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characteristics and single-gene identifications, which often identified species complexes rather than individual species. Due to the high variability in morphological characters, differentiation between the two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola, became problematic, leading to the adoption of molecular methods. These methods provide valuable

The main taxa reported to cause
China. In this study, we did not find C. theobromicola. However, there were 15 additional isolates in the single phylogenetic tree that included all the Colletotrichum species, which were not well resolved. Further clarifications of those isolates are needed. This study contributes to updating the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in China. Species with similar morphology may exhibit considerable physiological and pathogenic variation. Understanding the host distribution of a particular Colletotrichum species is crucial for implementing biosecurity measures in quarantine.
