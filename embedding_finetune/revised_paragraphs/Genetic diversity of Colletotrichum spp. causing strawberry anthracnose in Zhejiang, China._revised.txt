Abstract
Anthracnose is a serious fungal disease that primarily infects strawberry roots and stolons during development. Here, 91 isolates from different areas of Zhejiang province, China, were collected. Morphological characteristics were analyzed, and a phylogenetic analysis based on multiple genes (actin, internal transcribed spacer, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) was performed. We found that all of the Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose belonged to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. Among them, we identified 48 isolates of C. fructicola, 21 isolates of C. siamense, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides, and 9 isolates of C. aenigma. C. siamense was distributed in the central and eastern regions of Zhejiang province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Taizhou). This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province. C. fructicola was the most dominant species causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province. We identified the four species causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province, which will improve our understanding of the strawberry anthracnose epidemic and benefit the development of future control measures.

Strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa), which are native to South America, are widely cultivated in China. The area devoted to strawberry cultivation increased from 90,100 ha in 1985 to 330,000 ha in 2012; China produces 35.7% of all strawberries worldwide, making it the largest producer globally. Zhejiang province is one of the top eight strawberry-producing regions in China. Strawberry anthracnose is a serious fungal disease that can affect plants at any stage during their lifecycle. However, plants are most susceptible to strawberry anthracnose at the seedling stage and immediately after planting. Anthracnose primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but flowers and fruit can also be infected, leading to severe outbreaks. Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during the initial stages of stolon development, leaves and petioles with black spindle-shaped lesions, wilt, and dead roots. In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of all seedling deaths and over 40% of all production losses in the nursery are attributed to this disease. Throughout the entire plant growth cycle, strawberries are threatened by anthracnose disease. If environmental conditions are suitable, anthracnose can decrease strawberry yield by 80%. Transplants are believed to be the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberry in China remains unclear. Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions.
The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three Colletotrichum species or species complexes have been reported to cause strawberry anthracnose: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae both have narrow host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a few C. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al. 2016). The pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose in Hubei Province, China, were divided into two groups: the C. gloeosporioides species complex (including Colletotrichum aenigma, Colletotrichum fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and Colletotrichum murrayae) and the C. acutatum complex (including C. acutatum and Colletotrichum nymphaeae). In Florida, Ureña-Padilla et al. (2002) suggested that the pathogen causing anthracnose on the strawberry root crowns and stolons was C. gloeosporioides, whereas the pathogens causing anthracnose on the strawberry fruit were members of the C. acutatum complex. Based on morphological characters and analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA, Xie et al. (2010) showed that strawberry anthracnose infections in Zhejiang and Shanghai were caused by C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae. However, because this study only analyzed a single region and did not use multiple genes, the results may not be accurate. Indeed, multigene phylogenetic analyses, in conjunction with morphological characters, have been used to identify many important pathogens (Cai et al. 2009; Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). The classification and delimitation of Colletotrichum species have been debated (Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum isolates have been successfully identified based on multigene phylogenies and morphological characters, indicating that this method is mature and can accurately identify pathogens (Damm et al. 2012). However, morphological characters and multigene phylogenies have not been used to identify the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in China or to determine the distributions of these species.
The objectives of this study were (i) to use morphological and molecular characters to identify the species causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang Province and (ii) to determine the distributions and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species throughout the region.
Source and collection of fungal isolates. Zhejiang province (27°02' to 31°11'N, 118°01' to 123°10'E) is located on the southeast coast of the Yangtze River in southeastern China and has a humid, subtropical monsoon climate. We collected 234 anthracnose samples from strawberry plants cultivated in Zhejiang province between 2013 and 2017. The samples included irregularly shaped lesions from the stem; black, spindle-shaped lesions from the leaves or petioles; reddish-brown stolons; or the entire plant if roots were withered. Pathogens were isolated from diseased petiole, leaf, stolon, or root tissues. The diseased plant tissues were first cut into 5 × 5 mm pieces using sterilized scissors. Excised tissue pieces were rinsed in a 75% ethanol solution for 30 seconds, soaked in a 3% sodium hypochlorite solution (active chlorine: 6.8%) for 3 minutes, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, and then dried on sterile filter paper. After drying, each sample was placed on a plate containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium supplemented with a final concentration of 50 mg/ml of kanamycin sulfate and streptomycin sulfate to inhibit bacterial growth. The plate was incubated in an incubator at 25°C in darkness for 3 to 5 days. Hyphal growth was aseptically transferred to a new PDA plate. Anthracnose isolates were identified and selected based on the morphological characteristics of each species. Isolates were maintained on PDA slants at 4°C.
DNA extraction and PCR. When about 67% of the PDA plate (90 mm) was covered by mycelia, the hyphae were scraped off with sterile slides. DNA was extracted from the hyphae using a fungal genomic DNA rapid extraction kit. DNA extracted from each isolate was stored at −20°C. The target genes amplified in this study were actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the ITS. The corresponding primers used for PCR amplification are listed in a table. The PCRs were performed in an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 50 µl. The PCR mixtures contained 31.6 µl of UV-sterilized ultrafiltered water, 5 µl of 10× PCR buffer (with 20 mM MgCl2), 5 µl of dNTPs (each 20 mM), 2 µl of each primer (10 mM), 2 µl of albumin from bovine serum (BSA), 2 µl of genomic DNA, and 0.4 µl (1 U) of Roche FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase. PCRs were performed in a thermal cycler. The parameters for GAPDH were as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 5 minutes followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 0.5 minutes, with a final cycle at 72°C for 10 minutes. The param
Molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses were conducted using gene sequences homologous to ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS from the isolates. Colletotrichum boninense (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants [ICMP] 17904) served as the outgroup. All sequences were aligned with Clustal X 2.0.10, and comparisons and corrections were made using the “W” function in MEGA 5.0. The sequences were concatenated, and the best model of nucleotide substitution was estimated using Modeltest 3.7.win, Win-paup 4b10-console, and Mrmodeltest2, as implemented in MrMTgui. Bayesian inference phylogenies were constructed with Mr. Bayes v. 3.1.2, running six simultaneous Markov chains for 1,000,000 generations and sampling trees every 100 generations. The first 2,000 trees were discarded as burn-in, and the remaining 8,000 were used to calculate posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. Phylogenetic trees were drawn using Treeview, and the alignments and trees have been deposited in TreeBASE. The fungal isolates studied are listed in a supplementary table.
Morphological and cultural characterizations were performed on all 91 isolates, following methods described by Cai et al. Mycelia plugs (5.0 mm in diameter) from the edge of a 5-day-old colony on PDA were transferred to PDA plates and incubated at 28°C under a combination of white and near-UV fluorescent light sources with a 12-hour light/dark cycle. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with three replicates for each isolate. Colony color, conidial dimensions, and morphology were assessed using previously described methods. Conidial suspensions were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses grown on PDA. The shape and color of the conidia were observed, and the sizes of 50 conidia from each isolate were measured at 400× magnification under a light microscope.
For pathogenicity testing, 91 isolates were cultured on PDA medium for 5 days at 25°C. Samples were collected from the colony edge using a 5-mm punch, and the mycelial surface of the sample was placed in the center of an oat medium plate, which was also cultured at 25°C for 5 days. The hyphae on the surface of the resulting colony were scraped off and cultured again under the same light conditions for 10 to 15 days. After the production of numerous conidial heaps, spore suspensions were collected in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes using sterilized toothpicks and adjusted to 2.0 × 10^6 conidia per milliliter with a hemocytometer. Six-week-old leaves of healthy strawberry plants were used for further testing.

Molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses. Sequences homologous to the ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS gene sequences from the isolates were downloaded from GenBank. Colletotrichum boninense (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants [ICMP] 17904) was used as the outgroup. All sequences were aligned using Clustal X 2.0.10. Gene sequences were compared and corrected using the “W” function in MEGA 5.0. Gene sequences were concatenated. Modeltest 3.7, Win-paup 4b10-console, and Mrmodeltest2 as implemented in the MrMTgui were used to estimate the best model of nucleotide substitution. Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenies were constructed using MrBayes v. 3.1.2. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations each, and trees were sampled every 100th generation. The first 2,000 trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. Phylogenetic trees were drawn using Treeview. The alignments and trees have been deposited in TreeBASE. The fungal isolates used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Morphological and cultural characterization. Morphological and cultural characterizations were performed for all 91 isolates according to the methods described. Mycelial plugs (5.0 mm in diameter) from the edge of an actively growing 5-day-old colony of each tested isolate on PDA were transferred to PDA plates, and they were incubated at 28°C under a mixture of white and near-UV fluorescent light sources with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block, with three replicates of each isolate. Colony color, conidial dimensions, and morphology were assessed using previously described methods. Conidial suspensions of each species were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses grown on PDA. The shape and color of the conidia were observed, and the sizes of 50 conidia from each isolate were measured at 400× magnification under a light microscope.
Pathogenicity testing. Ninety-one isolates were cultured on PDA medium for 5 days at 25°C. Samples of these isolates were collected from the colony edge using a 5-mm punch. The mycelial surface of the sample was placed in the center of an oat medium plate and cultured at 25°C for 5 days. The hyphae on the surface of the resulting colony were scraped off and grown at 25°C under a mixture of white and near-UV fluorescent light sources with a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle for 10 to 15 days. After the production of a large number of conidial heaps, spore suspensions were collected in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes using sterilized toothpicks. Spore suspensions were adjusted to 2.0 × 10^6 conidia per millilit
Zhang Ji that had not been treated with any chemicals were used for inoculations. Both wounded leaves, which were scratched but not pierced with a sterilized insect needle, and non-wounded leaves were adopted to assess the pathogenicity and evaluate the effect of wounds on the infection. Each leaf was inoculated with a drop of 10-ml spore suspensions, and the negative control was inoculated with sterile water. Additionally, nine plants were inoculated for each isolate. Then, the plants were cultured in a greenhouse at 25 ± 5°C for 7 days under a light/dark cycle. Disease was assessed after 7 days by measuring the diameter of the disease lesion (Han et al. 2016). We calculated the disease incidence rate as the number of diameters of the disease lesion (Han et al. 2016). Data from the pathogenicity test were subjected to a one-way analysis of variance using the software IBM SPSS Statistics v22 to determine the significance of differences. Means for different species from the pathogenicity test were separated using the least significance difference test at the P = 0.05 level.
Results
Isolates of Colletotrichum spp. from strawberries in Zhejiang. Between 2013 and 2017, 234 samples with typical anthracnose symptoms were collected in Hangzhou, Ningbo, Taizhou, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou of Zhejiang province, China. From these samples, 91 isolates causing anthracnose were isolated. The distributions of the isolates across the region sampled are described in the corresponding figure.
Molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses. The ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS genes from all isolates were successfully amplified and sequenced. All isolates were identified as members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Bayesian Inference (BI) was performed on the haplotypes belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on the concatenated ACT, CHS-1, CAL, GAPDH, and ITS sequences. The concatenated alignment included 2,486 characters. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: ACT: 1 to 311; CAL: 312 to 1,189; CHS: 1,190 to 1,496; GAPDH: 1,497 to 1,804; and ITS: 1,805 to 2,486. The tested 91 isolates fell into four clades. BI values indicated that 48 isolates clustered with C. fructicola, 21 isolates clustered with Colletotrichum siamense, 13 isolates clustered with C. gloeosporioides, and 9 isolates clustered with C. aenigma. C. fructicola was most frequently isolated, identified in 53% of all samples, and BI values of 1.0 were observed among the 48 tested isolates. The BI values between the tested isolates and C. fructicola ICMP 17921, ICMP 18646, and ICMP 18581 were 1.0, 0.92, and 0.92, respectively. C. siamense, accounting for 23% of all samples, was distributed mainly in the central and eastern regions of Zhejiang province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Taizhou). Nine isolates had BI values of 0.5 with C. siamense ICMP 18642, while four and eight isolates had BI values of 0.53 with C. siamense ICMP 19118 and C. siamense ICMP 18578, respectively. The third species, identi
Morphological characters. The morphologies of the colonies of the four species grown on PDA media did not differ substantially. C. fructicola produced white colonies with irregular gray edges, and the colonies were black on the back of the PDA plates. The orange conidia were cylindrical with blunt or pointed ends, and attached cells were single or scattered. Most conidia were spherical, cylindrical, or spindle-shaped, and very few were irregular. A small number of conidia produced two nearly circular attached cells. The C. siamense colony was fluffy, with gray-white edges. The colony was neatly arranged, with yellow margins in the middle of the back of PDA plates. Conidia were straight, cylindrical, colorless, and smooth, with blunt ends. Spores attached to cells were brown, oval, or spindle-shaped, with complete edges. A few irregularly shaped spores were observed. The C. gloeosporioides colony was gray in the middle with white edges, and the back of the colony was black to gray with white edges. The conidial heaps were orange, cylindrical, and blunt at both ends or slightly pointed at one end. Attached cells were single or scattered, and most were spherical or elliptical, with a few irregular cells. The aerial hyphae of C. aenigma were sparse, light gray to white, and flocculent. The colony was light white on the back, with a gray-green center. Conidia heaps were rare. The conidia were stick-like, with one end obtusely rounded or with both ends slightly rounded. Most conidia had oil balls. Conidia were singly or loosely distributed, dark brown, and ovate or irregularly shaped. Some conidia were clover-shaped. Mycelial growth rates, attached cells, and conidia sizes in detail are described in a subsequent section.
Pathogenicity assays. All isolates of each species showed stronger pathogenicity on wounded leaves than on nonwounded leaves. For example, all isolates of C. fructicola had mean disease incidence rates of 79.9 ± 0.7 and 22.2 ± 0.7 and lesion diameters of 20.5 and 17.0 mm on wounded and nonwounded leaves, respectively. Meanwhile, significant differences were observed in lesion diameter but not in disease incidence between the four species on wounded leaves. On nonwounded leaves, significant differences were observed in both lesion diameter and disease incidence between species, with C. fructicola showing higher pathogenicity. Significant differences existed between and within species. One isolate with the strongest pathogenic ability within each species was presented: C. fructicola (HJD-49), C. siamense (HJD4-7), C. gloeosporioides (GT-10), and C. aenigma (nbg-18). HJD-49 (C. fructicola) exhibited strong pathogenicity on both wounded and nonwounded leaves. Among C. siamense, the first reported species on strawberry in Zhejiang, only a small portion of isolates, such as HJD4-7, caused similar disease on both types of leaves.
A detailed description of the primers used in the study includes their sequences, lengths, and references. Each gene has specific primers designated for amplification, including ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS. The lengths of the primers vary, with sequences provided for both forward and reverse directions. These primers were referenced from established studies, contributing to the methodology of the research.
This study performed a phylogenetic analysis using a combination of five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) and utilized this phylogeny, along with morphological characters, to identify 91 different isolates from samples of strawberry anthracnose collected in six cities in Zhejiang province, China. The species causing strawberry anthracnose were identified as C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense. All four species belong to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The C. gloeosporioides complex, along with C. fragariae and the C. acutatum complex, have previously been reported to infect strawberries and cause strawberry anthracnose. The C. gloeosporioides complex includes over 30 species, including C. gloeosporioides. This is the first report of C. siamense infecting strawberry plants and causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang. Our findings indicate that C. siamense is the second most common species causing strawberry anthracnose in the province. C. siamense is a synonym of Colletotrichum jasmini-sambac and Colletotrichum hymenocallidis. Although this species was originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, it has a wide geographical distribution and host range. Based on the variability in C. siamense morphological characters, it has been suggested that environmental conditions might affect mycelial growth. Different types of C. siamense colonies were observed in this study. The hyphal growth rate was relatively slow under the culture conditions used here. The colonies were generally grayish white, and a conidia pile was easily produced on PDA media. In the inoculation study, pathogenicity differed even within species. The isolates of C. siamense have rarely been studied, but our results indicate that future studies of the pathogenesis of these isolates are needed.
The phylogeny of 91 isolates in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex was constructed based on concatenated gene sequences (actin, internal transcribed spacer, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase). The evolution of each gene was modeled separately, and values next to nodes represent Bayesian posterior probability values based on 6,000,000 generations. Colletotrichum hippeastri served as an outgroup. Ex-type cultures were emphasized in bold, including the taxonomic names as originally described. The scale bar indicates the number of expected changes per site.
C. fructicola was originally reported in Thailand as a pathogen of coffee berries. This isolate grows quickly in hot, humid conditions and exhibits a strong sporulation ability. The species C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and C. aenigma can cause strawberry anthracnose. In this study, C. fructicola accounted for 52.7% of all samples and was observed in all regions sampled, suggesting that it is the dominant species causing strawberry anthracnose.
Zhejiang province. It is believed that C. fructicola is more pathogenic than C. gloeosporioides or C. aenigma (Han et al. 2016). Consistent with this, our pathogenicity experiments showed that C. fructicola was more pathogenic than C. gloeosporioides and C. aenigma. A previous study reported that C. murrayae was the dominant species causing strawberry anthracnose in Hubei, China, but no isolates of this species were found in this study (Han et al. 2016). C. gloeosporioides was previously thought to infect many types of fruit, particularly in the tropics (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003; Freeman et al. 1998; Sangeetha and Rawal 2007). However, studies have shown that this species is uncommon in the tropics and rarely causes anthracnose in tropical fruits (Phoulivong et al. 2010; Prihastuti et al. 2009; Rojas et al. 2010; Udayanga et al. 2013). In addition, not all isolates of C. gloeosporioides were pathogenic to strawberries in greenhouse tests (Mertely and Legard 2004). Here, C. gloeosporioides was present in 14.3% of all samples, making it the third most dominant group. However, we found that the disease index of this species was low, consistent with previous studies (Hu et al. 2014). C. aenigma was first described by Weir et al. (2012) based on phylogenetic analysis and morphological descriptions. This species primarily infects Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and Persea americana in Israel (Weir et al. 2012), but it has also been reported on grapes and a wide range of hosts (Yan et al. 2011). It is less virulent to strawberries and does not resist high temperatures (Han et al. 2016). The distribution of C. aenigma on strawberries in Zhejiang province is relatively sparse (Yan et al. 2011). The description of Colletotrichum annigma might be useful for the classification of the C. gloeosporioides complex, and the characteristics of this species require further study. Strawberry anthracnose was previously thought to be caused by a complex of C. gloeosporioides species, C. acutatum species, and C. fragariae (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). It is believed that the incidence of this disease relates to the host plant (Weir et al. 2012). Ureña-Padilla et al. (2002) suggested that the C. gloeosporioides complex caused anthracnose in the root crown, that C. acutatum caused anthracnose in the fruit, and that the C. gloeosporioides complex caused the infection in the canopy. The C. gloeosporioides species complex most commonly causes strawberry anthracnose in China, while the C. acutatum species complex occasionally causes anthracnose (Xie et al. 2010). Three C. acutatum isolates were identified in Hubei, China, by Han et al. (2016). This study did not find any C. acutatum species that have previously been reported to cause strawberry plant infections (MacKenzie et al. 2008).

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is characterized by off-white mycelia that lack conidial masses. The measurements recorded include colony diameter of 13.4 ± 0.7 mm (ranging from 12.8 to 15.3 mm), with a growth rate of 4.3 ± 0.4 mm (ranging from 2.1 to 6.5 mm), and a conidial size of 7.1 ± 0.4 μm (ranging from 6.6 to 8.3 μm). Additionally, the appressorium size is noted at 5.4 ± 0.6 μm (ranging from 5.1 to 6.4 μm) and the length of the conidia is 7.7 ± 0.3 μm. The germination rate of conidia is 89.7% (ranging from 82.9% to 96.6%), with a specific germination time of 13.5 hours. In contrast, Colletotrichum aenigma displays similar off-white mycelia but with conidial masses present. Its measurements include a colony diameter of 14.0 ± 0.8 mm (ranging from 12.5 to 16.6 mm), a growth rate of 4.5 ± 0.3 mm (ranging from 2.9 to 4.9 mm), and a conidial size of 9.4 ± 0.7 μm (ranging from 8.2 to 9.6 μm). The appressorium size measures 6.4 ± 1.0 μm (ranging from 5.6 to 7.2 μm), and the conidia length is 7.2 ± 0.2 μm. Its germination rate stands at 81.5% (ranging from 73.0% to 90.0%), taking 14.5 hours for germination.
All of the 91 isolates were assessed, and the colony characteristics varied between the two species. Data are presented as mean ± standard deviation or standard error, with ranges in parentheses. The disease was evaluated 7 days post-inoculation with a conidial suspension of Colletotrichum spp. by spray application. Mean values sharing the same letters indicate no statistical difference (P > 0.05) based on the least significant difference test.
