INTRODUCTION
Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi, responsible for several diseases in many crops worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. were recently included in the list of the 10 most important plant pathogenic fungi in the world, based on perceived scientific and economic importance. Agricultural production losses caused by Colletotrichum spp. involve important staple food crops grown in developing countries throughout the tropics and subtropics. Colletotrichum species can infect more than 30 plant genera, causing anthracnose disease and postharvest decay on a wide range of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits, grasses, vegetable crops, and ornamental plants. Moreover, many Colletotrichum species are latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, switching to a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are subjected to stress conditions or placed in postharvest storage. Appressoria that develop from germinating spores start plant infection by penetrating the cuticle and occasionally also the epidermal cells via fungal hyphae. The taxonomy of Colletotrichum species has recently been reviewed in several impactful studies. Before the molecular era, morphological characters such as size and shape of conidia and appressoria, presence or absence of setae, aspect, color, and growth rate of the colonies formed the basis for studying and comparing the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species. Modern studies demonstrated that these characters are not reliable for species-level identification due to their variability under changing environmental conditions.
Following the adoption of multi-gene phylogenetic analysis, the polyphasic protocols for studying the genus Colletotrichum significantly changed the classification and species concepts within this group (Cannon et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013, 2014, Weir et al. 2012). Several systematic studies of nearly all acknowledged species have led to the identification of 11 Colletotrichum species complexes and more than 20 singleton species (Cannon et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2014, 2016, Marin-Felix et al. 2017). In plant pathology, the most important species include C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al. 2008, Phoulivong et al. 2010, Weir et al. 2012), C. acutatum (Marcelino et al. 2008, Shivas & Tan 2009, Damm et al. 2012a, Baroncelli et al. 2015), C. boninense (Moriwaki et al. 2003, Yang et al. 2009, Damm et al. 2012b), and C. truncatum.
Species of Colletotrichum are recognized as significant plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes across a wide range of plant hosts. Many species are well-known in citrus, causing pre- and post-harvest infections such as anthracnose, postbloom fruit drop, tear stain, and stem-end rot on fruit, as well as wither-tip of twigs. In this study, we explored the occurrence, diversity, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with citrus and related genera in European orchards, nurseries, and gardens. Surveys were conducted in 2015 and 2016 across Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain, resulting in the isolation of 174 Colletotrichum strains from symptomatic leaves, fruits, petals, and twigs. A multi-locus phylogeny was established based on seven genomic loci (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, HIS3, and TUB2), and the morphological characteristics of the isolates were determined. Preliminary pathogenicity tests were performed on orange fruits with representative isolates.
Colletotrichum strains were identified as members of three major species complexes. Within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, C. gloeosporioides s.str. and two novel species (C. helleniense and C. hystricis) were identified. In the C. boninense species complex, C. karstii, C. novae­zelandiae, and two novel species (C. catinaense and C. limonicola) were found, while C. acutatum s.str. was isolated from the C. acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. karstii were the predominant species identified. This study represents the first report of C. acutatum on citrus in Europe and the first detection of C. novae­zelandiae outside New Zealand. Path
The use of multi-locus phylogenetic analyses has revealed numerous instances where certain Colletotrichum species, historically considered causal agents of economically significant plant diseases, were identified as different species. For example, C. alienum has emerged as the most important species in Proteaceae cultivation, rather than the previously assumed C. gloeosporioides s.str. The citrus industry is one of the most crucial fruit industries globally. Mediterranean countries rank second only to China in fruit production and are the largest fruit exporters after South Africa. Consequently, studying and understanding all pathogens affecting this crop is imperative.
A polyphasic approach has previously uncovered many cryptic and new Colletotrichum species associated with citrus, which belong to four species complexes: the C. boninense complex (including C. boninense, C. citricola, C. constrictum, C. karstii, and C. novae­zelandiae); the C. acutatum complex (including C. abscissum, C. acutatum, C. citri, C. godetiae, C. johnstonii, C. limetticola, and C. simmondsii); the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum); and the C. gloeosporioides complex (including C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense). Additionally, C. brevisporum and C. tropicicola have been reported in association with citrus. Several major citrus diseases are internationally caused by Colletotrichum species.
According to reports published prior to the major revisions of Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides and C. abscissum (formerly known as C. acutatum) are responsible for postbloom fruit drop (PFD) in Brazil and Bermuda, leading to petal necrosis, the abscission of developing fruit, and persistent calyces in various citrus species. A recent extensive investigation in São Paulo state, Brazil, identified only C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides s.str. associated with PFD disease. Key lime anthracnose (KLA), a complex disease affecting leaves, flowers, and fruits of Key lime, was initially attributed to C. acutatum but was later reclassified as C. limetticola. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was once thought to be the only species responsible for post-harvest anthracnose; however, recent studies have shown that several Colletotrichum species are associated with fruit decay worldwide. Researchers demonstrated the capability of C. fructicola and C. truncatum to cause anthracnose on citrus fruits. Furthermore, C. gloeosporioides s.lat. has been reported to cause pre-harvest symptoms, including wither-tip on twigs, tear-stain, and stem-end rot on fruit.
Recently, various infections caused by Colletotrichum spp. have strongly compromised citrus production in different Mediterranean countries. Heavy pre-harvest anthracnose symptoms appeared on orange fruits and lesions on the leaves of mandarins in Italy, twig wither-tip symptoms were observed on cultivated orange trees in Tunisia, and severe anthracnose symptoms on unripe and ripe lemon fruits were recorded in Portugal. In these studies, Colletotrichum species belonging to the C. acutatum species complex were never found associated with citrus. However, C. acutatum sensu lato was reported in Mediterranean countries causing diseases on several hosts such as Fragaria × ananassa, Arbutus unedo, and Olea europaea. Due to the commercial yield losses in citrus orchards caused by Colletotrichum infections, recent findings and changes in species concepts necessitate new surveys to study the Colletotrichum species diversity related to citrus and their occurrence and association with foliar and fruit diseases. The current study aimed to investigate the major citrus production areas in Europe through large-scale sampling and to identify isolates via morphology and multi-locus phylogeny based on modern taxonomic concepts. In 2015 and 2016, several surveys were conducted in commercial nurseries, citrus orchards, gardens, backyards, and plant collections to determine the occurrence of Colletotrichum spp. associated with citrus and allied genera (Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, Poncirus). The specific objectives of the present study were: i) to conduct extensive surveys for sampling fresh plant materials; ii) to cultivate as many Colletotrichum isolates as possible; iii) to subject those isolates to DNA sequence analyses combined with morphological characterization; iv) to compare the obtained results with data from other phylogenetic studies on the genus; and v) to evaluate the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species to citrus fruit.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Sampling and Isolation
During 2015 and 2016, several surveys were conducted in many of the main citrus-producing regions of Europe. Fruits and leaves with lesions and typical anthracnose symptoms, as well as twigs showing wither-tip, were collected from more than 70 sites in Andalusia, Valencia, Balearic Islands (Spain), Apulia, Calabria, Sicily, Eolian Islands (Italy), Algarve (Portugal), Missolonghi, Nafplio, Arta, Crete (Greece), and Malta and Gozo (Malta). Investigated species of citrus and allied genera such as Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, and Poncirus (Rutaceae) included Australasian lime, citranges, citrons, kumquat, mandarins, oranges, pummelo, grapefruit, limes, lemons, and ornamental brushes. Fungal isolates were obtained using two procedures. In the first, leaf, fruit, and twig fragments (5 × 5 mm) were surface sterilized in a sodium hypochlorite solution (10%) for 20 seconds, followed by 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, and rinsed three times in sterilized water. The fragments were dried on sterilized tissue paper, placed on malt extract agar (MEA) amended with 100 μg/mL penicillin and 100 μg/mL streptomycin (MEA-PS), and incubated at 25 °C until characteristic colonies developed.
Colletotrichum colonies were observed. In the second procedure, plant material was incubated in moist chambers at room temperature (25 °C ± 3 °C) for up to 10 days and inspected daily for fungal sporulation. Sporulating conidiomata obtained through both procedures were collected and crushed in a drop of sterile water, then spread over the surface of MEA-PS plates. After 24 hours, germinating spores were individually transferred onto MEA plates. The isolates used in this study are maintained in the culture collection of the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands, and in the working collection of Pedro Crous (CPC), housed at the Westerdijk Institute.
The research involved various isolates of Colletotrichum, including C. abscissum and C. acutatum, collected from different hosts such as Citrus sinensis, Hakea sericea, Carica papaya, and Olea europaea. The isolates were sourced from locations in Brazil, South Africa, Australia, and Portugal, among others. The details of the isolates include specific accession numbers and the type of plant material affected, such as leaf lesions. Other species like C. annelatum and C. asiaticum were also included, with respective identifiers indicating their origin from diverse geographical locations including Colombia, Thailand, and Japan. The data reflects a comprehensive collection aimed at understanding the diversity and distribution of Colletotrichum species.

GDF1 + GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003). The primers ACT-512F and ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999) were used to amplify part of the actin gene (ACT). The partial beta-tubulin (TUB2) gene was amplified with primers T1 (Glass & Donaldson 1995) and Bt-2b (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997). The primers CHS-79F and CHS-345R (Carbone & Kohn 1999) were used to amplify part of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1) gene. The partial histone 3 (HIS3) gene was amplified with primers CYLH3F and CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b). The PCR amplification mixtures and cycling conditions for all seven loci were followed as described by Damm et al. (2012b). The PCR products were sequenced in both directions using the BigDye® Terminator v. 3.1 Cycle Sequencing Kit (Applied Biosystems Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA), after which amplicons were purified through Sephadex G-50 Fine columns (GE Healthcare, Freiburg, Germany) in MultiScreen HV plates (Millipore, Billerica, MA). Purified sequence reactions were analyzed on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer (Life Technologies, Carlsbad, CA, USA). The DNA sequences generated were analyzed and consensus sequences were computed using the program SeqMan Pro (DNASTAR, Madison, WI, USA).
Novel sequences generated in this study were blasted against the NCBI's GenBank nucleotide database to determine the closest relatives for a taxonomic framework of the studied isolates. Alignments of different gene regions, including sequences obtained from this study and sequences downloaded from GenBank, were initially performed using the MAFFT v. 7 online server and then manually adjusted.
To establish the identity of isolates at the species level, phylogenetic analyses were conducted first individually for each locus and then as concatenated analyses of seven loci. Two separate analyses were conducted for the C. boninense species complex and the remainder of the Colletotrichum species included in this study. Additional reference sequences were selected based on recent studies on Colletotrichum species. Phylogenetic analyses were based on Maximum Parsimony (MP) for all the individual loci and on both MP and Bayesian Inference (BI) for the multilocus analyses. For BI, the best evolutionary model for each partition was determined and incorporated into the analyses. MrBayes was used to generate phylogenetic trees under optimal criteria per partition. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) analysis utilized four chains and started from a random tree topology. The heating parameter was set to 0.2, and trees were sampled every 1,000 generations. Analyses stopped once the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. The MP analyses were performed using PAUP. Phylogenetic relationships were estimated by heuristic methods.
The analysis involved several Colletotrichum species, with various entries listed that include their identifiers, geographical origins, and specific characteristics. Each entry provides details on the specific strains, such as their source (e.g., plant species) and the associated identifiers, ensuring a comprehensive understanding of the phylogenetic relationships among the strains studied.

Aiello et al. (2015), Cristóbal-Martínez et al. (2017) conducted an experiment where eight fruits for each isolate/clone combination were inoculated. The fruits were washed and surface-disinfected by immersion in 70% ethanol for 10 minutes, followed by two rinses in sterilized water. Six inoculation points per fruit were marked with a permanent marker and were injured using a sterile pipette tip, creating wounds approximately 2 mm in diameter. A spore suspension containing 1.0 × 10^5 conidia/mL was prepared from cultures grown on PDA for 15 days at 27 °C, and 10 μL were injected into each inoculation point. Control fruits were inoculated with sterile water. The inoculated oranges were placed in plastic containers, covered with plastic bags, and incubated in a growth chamber with 100% relative humidity at 25 °C, under a lighting rig providing a 12-hour photoperiod. Symptom development was evaluated 10 days after inoculation, and the percentage of infected inoculation points was calculated for each isolate/clone combination. This percentage was determined using the formula [(%) = (infected inoculation points / inoculated inoculation points) × 100%]. The inoculated fungi were re-isolated from the resulting lesions, and the identity of the re-isolated fungi was confirmed by sequencing the loci ACT and GAPDH, thus fulfilling Koch’s postulates.
In terms of results, symptoms of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. were frequently observed on several Citrus species in all countries investigated. The leaves displayed necrotic, circular spots with pale brown to purple margins, producing fruiting bodies of the fungus. Different symptoms were noted on the fruits, including irregular and sunken lesions that varied in size from purple-brown to black with acervuli. Additionally, fruits exhibited tear stains characterized by superficial, reddish-brown streaks or bands along the surface. Occasionally, a dark-brown to black rot with a well-defined margin at the stem-end was detected. Mummified fruits were sometimes observed alongside affected tips. Twigs exhibited typical dieback and wither-tip symptoms. Under high moisture conditions, pink masses of spores sporulated in acervuli on dead twigs. A total of 174 monosporic isolates resembling those of the genus Colletotrichum were collected, with isolates obtained from 17 species of Citrus at 44 different sites across Greece, Italy, Malta, Spain, and Portugal. Among these, 67 isolates were obtained from leaves, 72 from twigs, 28 from fruits, and seven from petals. Based on initial ITS and GAPDH sequencing, 82 representative isolates were selected for phylogenetic analysis and further taxonomic study.
The phylogenetic analyses yielded 14 maximum parsimony trees derived from single gene sequence alignments (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, HIS3, and TUB2) for both the C. boninense species complex and other Colletotrichum spp. The results confirmed that 30 isolates belonged to the C. boninense species complex, 50 to th
For the phylogeny of the C. boninense species complex, 411 characters were parsimony-informative, 454 were variable and parsimony-uninformative, and 2,248 characters were constant. A maximum of 1,000 equally most parsimonious trees were saved (Tree length = 1,236, CI = 0.871, RI = 0.947, and RC = 0.825). Regarding the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes, 1,171 characters were parsimony-informative, and 319 were variable and parsimony-uninformative.
The pathogenicity testing of Colletotrichum species on citrus fruits showed varying percentages of infected inoculation points for different species and isolates. For instance, C. gloeosporioides had the highest infection rate of 87.5% in Tarocco fruit and 83.3% in Tarocco ‘Scirè’. Other species like C. helleniense and C. hystricis showed moderate infection rates ranging from 14.6% to 31.2% for Tarocco and 8.3% to 16.6% for Tarocco ‘Scirè’. C. acutatum had a 0% infection rate in both fruit types, while C. catinaense and C. limonicola exhibited infection rates ranging from 8.3% to 18.75%. This data underscores the varying pathogenicity among the different Colletotrichum species affecting citrus crops.
Symptoms on citrus tissues associated with Colletotrichum spp. include anthracnose symptoms on leaves of naturally infected Citrus bergamia and Fortunella margarita, mummified fruit of Citrus limon, and various lesions on fruits, including sunken lesions on oranges and mandarins. Other symptoms observed include tear stains on grapefruits, stem-end rot on oranges, and wither-tips on Citrus sinensis trees.

In the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complex, the ITS partition had 167 unique site patterns, the GAPDH partition 247, the ACT partition 183, the CAL partition 304, the CHS­1 partition 81, the TUB2 partition 257, the HIS3 partition 123, and the analysis ran for 4,890,000 generations, resulting in 9,782 trees of which 7,338 trees were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. In the C. boninense species complex analysis, 19 Citrus isolates clustered with six reference strains of C. karstii, while five isolates clustered with the ex-type of C. novae­zelandiae. Moreover, three isolates were identified as C. catinaense and a further three as C. limonicola, forming two highly supported subclades (1.00/100), which are embedded in the same clade with C. novae­zelandiae. In the other analyses, two isolates clustered with the ex-type strain of C. acutatum s.str. and 44 isolates clustered with the ex-type strain and other reference strains of C. gloeosporioides s.str. Furthermore, two isolates were identified as C. hystricis (closely related to C. alienum) and four as C. helleniense (close to C. kahawae subspecies) within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The individual alignments and trees of the seven single genes in both analyses were compared with respect to their performance in species recognition. In the C. boninense species complex analysis, TUB2 differentiated all the taxa. Moreover, the single loci CAL and GAPDH clearly separated C. catinaense and C. limonicola, respectively. In the other analyses, all the Colletotrichum species collected from citrus in this study differed in GAPDH sequences. Furthermore, C. helleniense was also separated by CAL and TUB2, while ACT and CHS­1 distinguished C. hystricis.
Morphological observations, supported by phylogenetic inference, were used to identify four known species (C. gloeosporioides, C. novae­zelandiae, C. karstii, and C. acutatum) and to describe four novel species. Culture characteristics were assessed, and the color of the upper and lower surfaces of Petri dishes was determined. Hyphal appressoria were abundantly observed on the reverse side of colonies growing on SNA plates. Based on the results of both the phylogenetic and morphological analyses, the four distinct novel species are described below.
Colletotrichum catinaense (CBS 142417): Colonies on PDA showed distinct characteristics, with variations noted above and below; conidiomata, conidia, conidiophores, appressoria, and setae were also observed. The scale bars for all observations were set at 10 μm. Colletotrichum helleniense (CBS 142418): Similar observations were made, with specific characteristics noted for colonies, conidiomata, conidia, conidiophores, appressoria, and setae. Again, scale bars were set at 10 μm.
Appressoria were medium to dark brown, roundish or irregular in shape, single or in small groups, measuring 5–10 × 7–15 µm. The asexual morph on PDA exhibited acervular conidiomata, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells measuring 3.5–7 µm in diameter. Setae were brown, smooth, 2-septate, ranging from 55–90 µm long, with a conical or inflated dark brown base and rounded tip. Conidiophores were hyaline, smooth to undulate-walled, septate, and branched, reaching lengths of up to 35 μm. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth-walled, and cylindrical, measuring 5–15 × 4–5.5 µm. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, containing granular or guttulate contents, measuring 11.5–14.5 × 4–5.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.7 ± 0.8 × 4.7 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
The culture characteristics showed that colonies on SNA were flat with an entire margin, hyaline, measuring 40–46 mm in diameter in 7 days (54–59 mm in 10 days). Colonies on PDA had an entire margin, with a color gradient from green to grey in the center and white to pale buff at the margin, entirely covered with floccose to dense white to grey aerial mycelium, along with black conidiomata. Conidia were present in a pinkish orange mass, with the reverse side exhibiting grey to buff and pale luteous colors, measuring 59–62 mm in diameter in 7 days (72–75 mm in 10 days).
Materials examined include samples from Greece, specifically from wither-tip twigs of Poncirus trifoliata (citrumelo) on 20 May 2015 and fruit lesions of C. reticulata (mandarin) on the same date, both collected by V. Guarnaccia.

Notes — Colletotrichum catinaense was isolated from several hosts in Italy and Portugal. The isolation of this species from multiple combinations of organ/host demonstrates its ability to colonize different citrus tissues. This species is phylogenetically close to but clearly differentiated from C. novae­zelandiae in CAL and TUB sequences. Colletotrichum novae­zelandiae formed a separate lineage/cluster in all single-gene phylogenies (Damm et al. 2012b) before this study. Based on multi-locus phylogenetic analyses performed in this study, C. catinaense together with C. limonicola are new species belonging to the same clade of C. novae­zelandiae within the C. boninense species complex. This species is morphologically indistinguishable from the other two species of the same clade.

Colletotrichum spp. are frequently associated with several citrus diseases worldwide, such as PFD on sweet orange, KLA on lime, and wither-tip, leaf spot, pre- and post-harvest anthracnose on different hosts. Before the multi-gene analysis era, C. acutatum was identified as the only species responsible for PFD and KLA. Similarly, C. gloeosporioides was reported as the only Colletotrichum species to cause citrus fruit anthracnose. During the last decade, a polyphasic approach was used in several Colletotrichum studies, revealing new species involved with citrus diseases, such as C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides associated with PFD. In recent years, Colletotrichum spp. have affected several commercial orchards in the main citrus-producing areas of the Mediterranean, causing a broad variety of symptoms and, consequently, losses of marketable fruits. Therefore, a large-scale investigation of Colletotrichum spp. associated with citrus infections in Europe was necessary. This study provides the first molecular characterization of Colletotrichum diversity related to citrus production in Europe, combined with morphological characterization. We performed single-gene and multilocus DNA sequence analyses combining seven loci (ITS, CAL, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CHS­1, and HIS3) commonly used in previous phylogenetic studies of the C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. boninense species complexes. These species complexes incorporate several taxa. However, only the closest taxa to the eight Colletotrichum species recovered in this study were selected based on BLAST searches of NCBI's GenBank nucleotide database and included in the analyses. The final phylogenetic trees clearly distinguished each of these eight species. We surveyed several citrus orchards, plant nurseries, private gardens, and collections in five Mediterranean European countries. We further investigated host plant members of Citrus-allied genera, which are also economically important as ornamental or rootstock plants, and for fruit production. We obtained 174 Colletotrichum single spore strains from symptomatic tissues. Based on multi-locus data, we found species allocated in three species complexes. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides in the C. gloeosporioides species complex and C. karstii in the C. boninense species complex were the predominant species. However, C. gloeosporioides was found in all the countries investigated, whereas C. karstii was not isolated from samples collected in Greece. Moreover, C. acutatum s.str., part of the C. acutatum species complex, was recovered only on the Aeolian Islands (Italy), a volcanic archipelago to the north of Sicily. Colletotrichum novae­zelandiae was recovered in association with leaf spot on grapefruit in Greece and with twig cankers in orange and lemon trees in Malta. In addition, four new species were detected and described. Colletotrichum catinaense was associated with multiple symptoms on
Portugal. Colletotrichum helleniense was isolated from Citrus reticulata fruit anthracnose and from leaf lesions on Poncirus trifoliata in Greece. Colletotrichum hystricis was associated with leaf lesions of young plants of Citrus hystrix cultivated in a greenhouse located in Sicily, and C. limonicola was recovered from leaf lesions on lemon plants in Malta. The pathogenicity of all the species isolated from citrus samples collected in Europe was preliminarily tested on two clones of Citrus sinensis. Representative isolates were selected and artificially inoculated on orange fruits of clones ‘Tarocco Scirè’ and ‘Tarocco Nucellare’. All of the Colletotrichum species tested, except C. acutatum, developed lesions on the fruits. These results demonstrated a cross-infection potential between multiple species on the fruits of two clones, as previously reported in a study on Colletotrichum. However, our pathogenicity experiments were conducted under extreme conditions commonly applied in artificial inoculations, and it remains to be seen how easily symptom development will occur under natural conditions. The pathogenicity test performed in this study confirmed that C. acutatum is not able to cause symptoms on citrus fruits. However, the establishment of the PFD disease caused by C. acutatum in Europe should be a focus in future surveys. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was the most aggressive species, causing typical brown lesions that involved the skin and albedo tissues. Although C. karstii showed the lowest aggressiveness, the pathogenicity test demonstrated its ability to cause lesions on fruits, which was also true for the remaining species: C. catinaense, C. helleniense, C. hystricis, C. limonicola, and C. novae­zelandiae. The clone ‘Tarocco Scirè’ appeared more susceptible than ‘Tarocco Nucellare’, as demonstrated by recent studies on C. gloeosporioides and C. karstii.
Species complex details indicate various hosts and their geographical distribution. For instance, C. acutatum was found on Citrus sinensis flowers in Brazil and the USA, and on leaves of Citrus limon in Italy. C. citri was reported on Citrus aurantiifolia twigs in China, while C. gloeosporioides affected multiple Citrus species across different regions, highlighting the diversity and spread of Colletotrichum species associated with citrus crops.

The global distribution of Colletotrichum species occurring in Citrus hosts and allied genera is summarized in a table. It includes various species such as C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola, along with their respective hosts and locations where they were found, including different countries and specific Citrus varieties.
Colletotrichum acutatum s.lat. is a common pathogen of several crops, including citrus, worldwide. In Europe, it has been detected on different hosts such as strawberry, strawberry tree, and olives, but never on citrus. Furthermore, C. novae­zelandiae was previously recovered from grapefruit and chili in New Zealand. Thus, this study represents the
Colletotrichum karstii, a member of the C. boninense species complex, has been reported on many host plants with a wide geographical distribution. This species has been documented on citrus in South Africa, New Zealand, and China, as well as in Europe, where it has been identified as a citrus pathogen in Italy and Portugal. In Europe, C. karstii has also been detected on other hosts such as tropical fruits, cotton, and lupine plants.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was largely dominant in our investigation, aligning with recent global findings. It was isolated from all sampled citrus organs (leaves, flowers, fruit, and twigs) and proved to be the most aggressive Colletotrichum species. This species is recognized as a pathogen of the main cultivated citrus species worldwide, and this study represents the first report of C. gloeosporioides associated with citrus flower disease in Europe, a condition previously reported in Brazil.
Colletotrichum catinaense and C. limonicola are newly identified species within the C. novae­zelandiae clade of the C. boninense species complex. Colletotrichum catinaense was found associated with infections of diverse citrus species, whereas C. limonicola was isolated only from lemon leaf lesions. Further surveys are needed to explore the distribution and host specificity of these new species.
Colletotrichum helleniense was isolated from Citrus reticulata and Poncirus trifoliata, a member of the Rutaceae family widely cultivated in nurseries as citrus rootstock due to its economically useful traits, including cold tolerance and resistance to Citrus Tristeza Virus. This report highlights the ability of C. helleniense to colonize tissues of different genera within the Rutaceae.
Recent studies have supported the distinction of two C. kahawae subspecies as cryptic species. Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro, one of these subspecies, has been recorded as a pathogen of mandarin. However, C. helleniense is phylogenetically close to both C. kahawae subspecies but is clearly differentiated based on multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, representing a new species in the C. kahawae clade of the C. gloeosporioides species complex.
Colletotrichum hystricis was isolated from lesions on leaves of Citrus hystrix, a commonly cultivated species known for its pleasant aroma and referred to as medicinal lime. Although the fruit is not highly valued, it is economically significant for the extraction of essential oils used in cooking and cosmetics. Colletotrichum hystricis is closely related to but distinctly differentiated from C. alienum, which is commonly associated with cultivated fruits. The present study describes it as a distinct taxon, supported by morphological differences such as obovoidal conidia and a slower growth rate in culture. Additionally, C. alienum is characterized by the development of perithecia in culture, while the two strains of C. hystricis did not produce perithecia on artificial media in this study.
This study provides the first overview of Colletotrichum diversity associated with various disease symptoms on citrus fruits and plants in Europe and offers valuable information for pathogenicity evaluation and effective disease control.
Preliminary inoculations also demonstrated the ability of all the Colletotrichum species found in Europe to cause infections on orange fruits. Further studies are thus required to resolve the host range and pathogenicity of the Colletotrichum species reported on other Citrus species and different plant organs.
