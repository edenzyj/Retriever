Abstract: Although hydroponic techniques enable intensive and effective crop management, controlling the watering for each crop type and growth stage is challenging using the commonly used timed watering system. Therefore, excessive and insufficient watering occurs frequently. Hydroponic technology that considers the drainage rate can minimize the amount of drainage, thereby reducing environmental pollution and fertilizer consumption. This study compared the drainage rate and the timed watering methods in a strawberry hydroponic system and determined the optimal drainage rate. As the drainage rate increased, the amount of water supplied increased. A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. Drainage electrical conductivity (EC) level was the highest in the 10% drainage rate group. In the 20% drainage rate treatment, leaf length and width increased compared to the four applications timer-supplying method. The yield of fruits weighing more than 27 g was the highest in the 20% drainage rate treatment. Therefore, the 20% drainage rate treatment was the most appropriate. We propose that it is possible to reduce unnecessary fertilizer consumption and increase productivity by controlling the water supply using the drainage rate for precise water supply management of strawberries.

1. Introduction
Korean strawberry production amounted to 1.23 billion won and 163 thousand tons in 2020. It ranked first among horticultural crops and is the main income crop for farms. In 2021, the greenhouse strawberry cultivation area was 6057 ha, and the open field cultivation area was only 46 ha, accounting for less than 1% of the total strawberry cultivation area. The hydroponic cultivation area for strawberries was expanded to 1596 ha in 2020.
Hydroponics using an artificial substrate can provide physical and chemical conditions suitable for nutrient absorption by plants. Intensive and effective crop management can be achieved using hydroponic techniques that supply nutrients to crops through a nutrient solution in the substrates. In hydroponics, water supply control is performed to maintain crop growth in an optimal state, minimize loss of substrates, and improve quality. The timer control method used on most farms sets the watering time using a timer. It is the cheapest and simplest to install and operate; however, it is difficult to control the watering according to crops, cultivars, growth stages, and seasons, leading to excessive watering.
An appropriate balance of solid, gaseous, and liquid phases is required to create an optimal rhizosphere state for plant growth. Along with the expansion of hydroponic areas, most hydroponic farms in Korea are growing crops in open hydroponic systems. The high usage volumes of the nutrient solution increase production costs, and the residual fertilizer in the discharged nutrient solution results in environmental pollution. Vegetable crops can grow under conditions of low nutrient concentration when the rhizosphere buffering capacity is high, meaning that in hydroponics, the yield and quality of crops are not affected by short-term nutrient depletion. Therefore, it is possible to employ a strategy to reduce nutrient discharge during hydroponics cultivation and improve the efficiency of water and nutrients by controlling the amount of nutrient solution discharged. Hydroponic technology that considers the drainage rate can reduce fertilizer consumption by supplying the necessary levels of water and nutrients to crops, minimizing drainage, and preventing environmental pollution.
This study was conducted to determine an appropriate watering method by comparing the irrigation characteristics of the timed and drainage rate watering control methods, which are commonly used as farmhouse practices in the hydroponic cultivation of strawberries. Additionally, we analyzed the growth and quality of strawberries cultivated using each watering method.
Materials and Methods
This experiment was conducted in a single plastic greenhouse (width 7 m, length 40 m) of the National Institute of Horticultural and Herbal Science in Wanju-gun, Jeollabuk-do. A multi-pot with 8 planting spaces (Multicup pot type A; Hwasung Industrial Co., Ltd., Jinju, Korea) with a planting distance of 17 cm was placed on high beds (28 cm width, 90 cm bed distance) and filled with a horticultural strawberry substrate (Chamgeuro Industrial Co., Ltd., Hongseong, Korea). On 9 August 2021, 1 dripper (Netafim, Hatzerim, Israel) was inserted into each pot to water the substrate with groundwater (EC 0.34 dS m−1, pH 7.26). The greenhouse was solar sterilized and closed until planting. On 16 September 2021, ‘Fragaria × ananassa Duch. cvs. ‘Kuemsil’ strawberry plants were planted in the multi-pots, one per pot. Strawberries were grown in 15 beds placed in five rows and three columns in the greenhouse. Each bed was 4 m long, and 6 multi-pots were used per bed. The standard nutrient solution prescribed by the National
Herbal Science for strawberries was supplied with the following macroelements: NO3-N 6.0 me·L−1, NH4-N 0.2 me·L−1, PO4-P 2.0 me·L−1, K 3.5 me·L−1, Ca 3.0 me·L−1, Mg 1.0 me·L−1, SO4-S 1.0 me·L−1; and microelements: Fe 1.30 mg·L−1, B 0.30 mg·L−1, Mn 0.30 mg·L−1, Zn 0.3 mg·L−1, Cu 0.02 mg·L−1, Mo 0.01 mg·L−1. The temperature and relative humidity in the greenhouse during the cultivation period were measured at 5-second intervals using an environmental data logger. The average monthly temperature inside the greenhouse during the cultivation period was 14.6 °C in December, 14.7 °C in January, 15.7 °C in February, and 16.5 °C in March. The relative humidity was recorded as 4.1% in December, 69.6% in January, 65.5% in February, and 69.5% in March.
Irrigation was controlled using a drainage rate as the basis, with an irrigation program in place. In all treatments, the volume for a single supply was set at 50 mL, with the first supply occurring at 9:00 AM. The drainage rate was calculated every minute by measuring the nutrient solution supplied against the drainage amount. If the drainage rate was less than 10%, 20%, or 30% one hour after the initial watering, the next watering was carried out. No watering took place after 6:00 PM, and the maximum number of applications was capped at 8 to avoid overwatering. As controls, the nutrient solution was supplied with a fixed volume of 50 mL per irrigation event, following a timer control method. The first timer control was set for daily watering at 9:00 AM, 11:00 AM, 2:00 PM, and 4:00 PM, resulting in four applications daily. The second timer control allowed for six daily applications at 8:30 AM, 10:30 AM, 12:00 PM, 1:00 PM, 3:00 PM, and 4:00 PM.
Drainage was collected every 3 to 4 days for each treatment to analyze the electrical conductivity (EC) and pH of the irrigation and drainage. EC and pH were measured using a multi-parameter meter. Water use efficiency (WUE), which indicates the relationship between aerial growth and fruit yield against the retained water content of the plant, was calculated by dividing the retained water content by the fresh weight of the plant's aerial parts and fruits.
Growth, fruit quality, and yield characteristics of strawberries were measured according to established research standards. The plant height, petiole length, leaf nu
Biosciences Inc., Lincoln, NE, USA, operated at an airflow rate of 400 µmol·s−1, a temperature of 25 ◦C, and a CO2 concentration ranging from 0 to 1200 µmol·mol−1.
Fruits were harvested weekly from 14 December to 28 March. The marketable product is classified into seven categories based on fruit weight: more than 42 g, between 37 and 42 g, between 32 and 37 g, between 27 and 32 g, between 22 and 27 g, between 17 and 22 g, and between 12 and 17 g. Fruits weighing less than 12 g were classified as small fruits, while fruits that were deformed due to insufficient pollination were classified as malformed. The percentage of marketable fruits was calculated by excluding the small and malformed fruits.
The aerial and root parts were separated, and the inorganic content was analyzed according to the Rural Development Administration’s research and analysis standards. The material was dried in a dryer at 75 ◦C for 72 hours and then pulverized. Subsequently, 0.5 g of the pulverized sample was transferred into a 100 mL glass flask containing 10 mL of a plant decomposition solution (HNO3
in a ratio of 75:15). The sample was left for one day and then placed on a heating plate. The temperature of the heating plate was gradually increased from 80 ◦C to 250 ◦C until the red sample turned white, indicating that decomposition was complete. After allowing the decomposed sample to cool naturally, it was filtered into a 100 mL flask using filter paper. The analysis was carried out by adding distilled water to reach a final volume of 100 mL. Total nitrogen (T-N) was analyzed using a nitrogen and total carbon analyzer, while potassium (K), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sodium (Na) were analyzed using an inductively coupled plasma spectrometer. Phosphate (P) was analyzed using a mixture of plant decomposition solution and ammonium metavanadate solution, which was shaken at 35 ◦C for 30 minutes, cooled naturally, and measured for absorbance at 660 nm using a spectrophotometer.
Analysis of variance (ANOVA) and two-way ANOVA were performed using the Sigmaplot program and the R program. Duncan’s multiple range test (DMRT) was applied, and p < 0.05 was deemed significant for all tests.
As a result of examining the amount of watering and drainage during the cultivation period, the fixed watering method set at six watering events had the largest amount of watering (239.6 mL). The watering method set at four watering events had the lowest amount of watering (157.3 mL). When watering was controlled based on the drainage rate, 161.1, 173.3, and 183.8 mL were supplied at drainage rates of 10%, 20%, and 30%, respectively. When the timer was set for four waterings, the amount of water supplied was similar to that of the water supply control based on a drainage rate of
The lower the drainage rate, the lower the amount of water provided. The amount of water supplied to the 10% drainage treatment was 12.4% lower than that of the 30% drainage treatment and 32.8% lower than in the six-time fixed timer method. The lower the drainage standard, the longer it takes to reach the drainage amount, which is the point of irrigation. This is similar to results from a previous study investigating complex water supply control using insolation and substrate water content and irrigation programs using integrated indoor solar radiation. The average daily drainage amount per plant was 126.7 mL when the timer was set for six applications, which was 57.6% higher than in the 30% drainage rate treatment and 162.2% more than in the 10% drainage rate treatment. The method of setting the timer for four applications and the water supply method based on a drainage rate of 10% had a similar nutrient solution supply and drainage amount. When the timer was set for six applications, an excessive amount of supply and drainage was observed compared to that of the supply control method using the drainage rate, indicating wastage of the nutrient solution. Various environmental factors, such as light, root temperature, humidity, EC level, and the oxygen content of the solutions, affect crops inside the greenhouse; therefore, it is impossible to set optimal conditions for crop growth as the water supply control using a timer does not consider these factors.
During the cultivation period, the irrigation and drainage ECs were investigated. The irrigation EC level in all treatments was 1.25 ± 0.007 dS·m−1. The drainage EC level varied because the amount of nutrient solution supplied depended on the supply method. The drainage EC levels were 1.87, 1.76, 1.71, 2.06, and 1.57 dS·m−1 for the 10%, 20%, 30%, four times, and six times timed application treatments, respectively. The four-times timed application treatment group had the highest drainage EC level, which was 31.2% higher than that of the six-times timed application treatment and 20.5% higher than the 30% drainage rate treatment group. In controlling watering using the drainage rate, when the nutrient solution was supplied based on a drainage rate of 10%, the maximum drainage EC level reached 2.65 dS·m−1, indicating a high value. This finding aligns with previous results where the drainage rate decreased, and the drainage EC level was high when the supply EC level was high and the water supply was low in melon hydroponics. The irrigation solution pH averaged 6.81 ± 0.03 across all treatment groups, while the drainage pH was 7.11 ± 0.06, indicating no significant difference between treatments.
The changes in irrigation and drainage amounts of strawberry 'Kuemsil' were influenced by the nutrient solution supplying system using different drainage rate levels and timings, specif
The effects of the watering methods on strawberry growth characteristics are discussed in the article. There was no significant difference among the watering methods during the early growth stage. However, during the late growth period, the leaf length and width increased in the drainage rate control method compared to the timer control method. In the treatment with a drainage rate of 20%, the leaf length and width increased by 14.1% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the four applications timer-supplying method, and by 23.6% and 29.5%, respectively, compared to the six applications timer-supplying method.
Additionally, the irrigation solution pH was 6.81 ± 0.03 on average across all treatment groups, while the drainage pH was 7.11 ± 0.06, indicating no significant difference between treatments. The irrigation and drainage amounts of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ were influenced by the nutrient solution supplying system, which utilized different drainage rate levels (10%, 20%, or 30%) and timings (Timer 1 for four applications daily; Timer 2 for six applications daily). Vertical bars indicate standard errors of the means (n = 3). Furthermore, the irrigation and drainage electrical conductivity (EC) levels were also affected by these variables.
The effects of the watering methods on strawberry growth characteristics are presented. There was no significant difference among the watering methods during the early growth stage. However, the leaf length and width increased in the drainage rate control method compared to the timer control method during the late growth period. In the treatment with a drainage rate of 20%, the leaf length and width increased by 14.1% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the four applications timer-supplying method, and by 23.6% and 29.5%, respectively, compared to the six applications timer-supplying method. If the water content of the rhizosphere is kept low due to the low drainage rate, water stress at the roots increases, and nutrient absorption is inhibited, leading to a decrease in plant and leaf area. The leaf area showed the lowest value at 1173 mm² in the treatment with four daily watering events and the highest value at 1586 mm² in the treatment with a 20% drainage rate. However, there was no statistically significant difference.
The growth characteristics of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ were affected by the nutrient solution supplying system using different drainage rate levels and timings at 159 (early harvest season) and 218 (late harvest season) days after transplanting. The drainage rates examined were 10%, 20%, and 30%, with Timer 1 set for four applications daily and Timer 2 set for six applications daily. In the early harvest season, the average number of leaves ranged from 10.1 to 10.4, while plant height varied from 26.4 cm to 27.4 cm across treatments. The petiole length, leaf length, leaf width, and crown diameter also varied slightly but showed no significant differences. In the late harvest season, the number of leaves increased, with values ranging from 14.2 to 15.0. The plant height and petiole length showed similar trends. The measurements indicate that the highest leaf length and width were associated with the 20% drainage rate treatment.
As a result of examining the fresh and dry weight of the aerial and root parts of the plant, the group treated with six daily watering events, receiving the largest amount of water, had the highest fresh weight at 110.9 g per plant. The fresh weight of the group treated with a drainage rate of 10% showed a 25.3% lower value than Timer 2 at 88.5 g per plant. The dry weight of the aerial part showed the lowest value in the 10% drainage treatment group at 23.8 g per plant, but there was no statistically significant difference. The average root fresh weight was 222 ± 11.4 g, and the dry weight was 37.6 ± 1.93 g, with no significant differences between treatments. The CO2 fixation rate of plant leaves directly reflects the level of photosynthesis and is used as an index to evaluate the photosyntheti
Figure 3 describes the fresh weight and dry weight of aerial and root parts of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ as influenced by the nutrient solution supplying system with varying drainage rates and timings. The drainage rates were set at 10%, 20%, or 30%, with Timer 1 configured for 4 daily applications and Timer 2 for 6 daily applications. The vertical bars represent the standard errors of the means based on 15 samples. The DMRT analysis at p < 0.05 shows that different letters indicate significant differences between treatments.
Figure 4 illustrates the rhizosphere differences of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ under the same nutrient solution supplying system conditions.
The CO2 fixation rate in plant leaves serves as a direct reflection of photosynthesis levels and is a key index for assessing the photosynthetic performance of plants under environmental stress. The assimilation rate for the drainage treatment at a CO2 concentration of 1200 μmol∙mol−1 was approximately 29.4 ± 1.44 μmol∙m−2∙mol−1. No significant difference was observed compared to the timer-supplying method. This finding aligns with previous research, which indicated no significant variation in photosynthesis rates between a watering method utilizing an FDR sensor and one using a timer.
The CO2 response curves of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ were affected by the nutrient solution supplying system, utilizing different drainage rate levels and timers. The drainage rates included 10%, 20%, or 30%, while Timer 1 was set for four applications daily, and Timer 2 for six applications daily. Vertical bars represent standard errors of the means (n = 3). A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. Various irrigation levels significantly impacted all nutrients. Similar outcomes to this study were documented, showing increased calcium (Ca) and potassium (K) concentrations in strawberry leaves when given 30% to 50% less irrigation water compared to control conditions. The correlation coefficients for K and magnesium (Mg), and K and Ca were −0.60 and −0.65, respectively. These negative correlations suggest that K ions inhibited the absorption and exhibited antagonistic action toward Mg and Ca ions in strawberry plants. Antagonism during absorption can occur through specific or non-specific pathways between cations, with phosphoric acid, calcium, magnesium, and manganese typically decreasing as potassium fertilization concentration increases in the ‘Nyoho’ strawberry. Potassium ions antagonize Ca and Mg ions. Conversely, the correlation coefficient between Mg and Ca was 0.61, indicating a synergistic action between these two ions. The nutrient contents of the root portion of the strawberry did not show any significant difference based on the watering method. However, similar to the aerial parts, total nitrogen and K contents decreased as the water supply increased. Additionally, the total nitrogen and total carbon content of the root exhibited a strong correlation, with a coefficient of 0.76, indicating that increased root biomass carbon corresponds to increased root biomass nitrogen.
The weight and number of fruits per plant for each irrigation treatment were investigated, and the yield was compared. The total weight of fruits weighing more than 12 g was 342 g per plant in the 20% drainage treatment group, which is 11.6% higher than in the 10% drainage rate treatment group and 15.4% higher than in the 4 applications timer treatment. The average marketable fruit rate was 86.0 ± 0.2%, with no significant difference between treatments. The ‘Keumsil’ strawberry cultivar is a high-quality strawberry known for its good taste and excellent storage. A higher fruit ratio correlates with a higher price. Although there was no significant difference in productivity for fruits weighing more than 27 g among the watering methods, the 20% drainage treatment group achieved the highest productivity of 248 g per plant, yielding 22.4% more than the 4 applications timer method. Regression analysis comparing the yield per m² resulted in the equation y = −42.51x² + 17.377x + 2.6913.
The marketable fruit yield characteristics of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ were analyzed across different irrigation treatments. In the 10% drainage treatment, the total marketable fruit yield was 306 g per plant, while it was 342 g in the 20% treatment, indicating a notable increase. The 30% drainage treatment yielded 312 g, and the timer treatments produced yields of 296 g and 341 g, respectively, for Timer 1 and Timer 2. The marketable fruit ratios were consistently high across treatments, ranging from 85.3% to 86.6%. The data suggest that while there are no significant differences in certain clusters, the drainage rate impacts overall yield positively.
Marketable fruit yield characteristics of strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ were assessed based on the nutrient solution supplying system under different drainage rate levels and timings. The results for marketable fruit yield (in grams per plant), yield (in kilograms per square meter), and marketable fruit ratio across various treatments showed the following:
For a drainage rate of 10%, the yield was 161 grams per plant, 127 grams from the first cluster, 18.2 grams from the second cluster, and a total yield of 306 grams, with a marketable fruit ratio of 86.6%. At a 20% drainage rate, the respective values increased to 175 grams per plant, with 148 grams from the first cluster and a total yield of 342 grams, maintaining a marketable fruit ratio of 86.1%. The 30% drainage rate yielded 159 grams per plant with 129 grams from the first cluster and a total yield of 312 grams, resulting in a marketable fruit ratio of 85.3%. For Timer 1, which applied the solution four times daily, the yield was 153 grams per plant, while Timer 2, set for six applications daily, produced 162 grams per plant.
Additionally, fruit characteristics such as weight, height, width, soluble solid content, firmness, acidity, and soluble solid-acid ratio were analyzed. For the 10% drainage rate, the fruit weight was 40.6 grams, height 5.6 cm, width 4.5 cm, with a soluble solid content of 11.9 °Brix and an acidity of 0.61%. The corresponding figures for the 20% drainage rate were 44.0 grams, 5.7 cm, 4.5 cm, with the same soluble solid content and acidity, while the 30% drainage rate showed a fruit weight of 46.9 grams, height of 5.9 cm, and a soluble solid content of 12.7 °Brix with a similar acidity of 0.59%.
A regression analysis indicated no significant differences in soluble solid content or acidity across the treatments. Correlation analyses suggested that an increase in leaf length, width, and number correlated with a decrease in the soluble solid-acid ratio, highlighting the complex interactions between growth parameters and fruit quality in strawberry cultivation under varying nutrient solutions.
The water absorption characteristics of strawberry plants during the cultivation period were analyzed. The total amount of water supplied was 21.5 L per plant when the timer was set for six applications, which was 48.3% higher than that of the 10% drainage treatment group, which received 14.5 L. The amount of drainage was 11.3 L in the treatment with the six applications timer, which was 162.8% higher than that in the 10% drainage rate treatment. The amount of water retained, calculated by subtracting the drainage from the total amount supplied, was 10.1 L in the 10% drainage rate treatment, which was 8.6% higher than that of the 30% drainage treatment. There was no statistically significant difference in water use efficiency (WUE). However, the WUE of the 10% drainage rate treatment and the four applications timer group showed the lowest efficiency at 43.6 g·L−1. In the treatment with a drainage rate of 30%, WUE was 13.8% higher than that of the treatment group with four timed applications and also higher than that of the 10% drainage rate. This indicates that when the same amount of water was supplied, aerial growth and fruit productivity were 13.8% higher when the water supply was controlled using the drainage rate. When controlling the water supply using the drainage rate, the total water supplied is less than that of the six-timer treatment. However, it shows a similar WUE level, which presumably reduces unnecessary fertilizer consumption.
The results indicated a correlation analysis between total supply/drainage per plant, water content, and WUE. The correlation coefficients of total water supply and total drainage were 0.64 and 0.65, respectively, indicating a significant positive correlation. The correlation coefficient of WUE was -0.70, indicating a negative correlation.
In summary, the total irrigation volume (TIV), total drainage volume (TDV), total retained volume (TRV), and water use efficiency (WUE) per strawberry ‘Kuemsil’ plants were affected by different drainage rate levels and timings. For the 10% drainage treatment, the total irrigation volume was 14.5 L, with a drainage volume of 4.3 L and a retained volume of 10.1 L, resulting in a WUE of 43.6 g·L−1. The 20% drainage treatment had a TIV of 15.6 L, TDV of 5.1 L, TRV of 10.5 L, and a WUE of 48.4 g·L−1. The 30% drainage treatment recorded a TIV of 16.5 L, TDV of 7.2 L, TRV of 9.3 L, and a WUE of 49.6 g·L−1. For Timer 1, the TIV was 14.1 L, TDV was 4.0 L, TRV was 10.2 L, and the WUE was 43.6 g·L−1. In contrast, Timer 2 had a TIV of 21.5 L, TDV of 11.3 L, TRV of 10.2 L, and a WUE of 49.7 g·L−1
Most of the hydroponic farms in Korea are growing crops in open hydroponic systems. The high usage volumes of the nutrient solution increase production costs. By using the drainage rate, the new watering method offers certain economic value. In the case of hydroponics cultivation of the strawberry cultivar ‘Keumsil,’ the water supply control method using the drainage rate showed higher productivity with a smaller amount of water supply than the water supply control method using a timer. At a 20% drainage rate, the fresh weight of the aerial part and the yield of fruits exceeding 27 g were high. However, there was no significant difference within the experimental range explored. The data might be evaluated during another harvesting season, with more separate plots, in order to obtain significant, more precise figures, provided such research is justifiable by potential economic gains. Additionally, a wider experimental domain should be considered to detect how the dependent variable is affected. It is proposed that with the area of hydroponic cultivation rapidly increasing, it is possible to reduce unnecessary fertilizer consumption and increase the productivity of high-quality strawberries by using the drainage rate water supply control method.
The supplementary materials include a correlation matrix between growth and fruit characteristics of the strawberry ‘Keumsil,’ as affected by the nutrient solution supplying system using different drainage rate levels and timers. Key parameters in this matrix include plant length, number of leaves, petiole length, leaf length, leaf width, crown diameter, soluble solid content, firmness, acidity, soluble solid content/acidity, fruit length, fruit width, and fruit weight. Another figure illustrates the water uptake characteristics correlation matrix of strawberry ‘Keumsil,’ affected by the nutrient solution supplying system with varying drainage rate levels and timings, focusing on total irrigation volume, total drainage volume, total retained volume, and water use efficiency. Asterisks indicate significant differences according to Duncan’s multiple range test at p < 0.05 (), 0.01 (), and 0.001 ().
