Abstract:
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is one of the major problems in mango production worldwide, including Thailand. All mango cultivars are susceptible, but Nam Dok Mai See Thong (NDMST) is the most vulnerable. Through a single spore isolation method, a total of 37 isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from NDMST showing anthracnose symptoms. Identification was performed using a combination of morphological characteristics, Koch’s postulates, and phylogenetic analysis. The pathogenicity assay and Koch’s postulates on leaves and fruit confirmed that all Colletotrichum spp. tested were causal agents of mango anthracnose. Multilocus analysis using DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, β-tubulin (TUB2), actin (ACT), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) was performed for molecular identification. Two concatenated phylogenetic trees were constructed using either two loci of ITS and TUB2, or four loci of ITS, TUB2, ACT, and CHS-1. Both phylogenetic trees were indistinguishable and showed that these 37 isolates belong to C. acutatum, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. siamense. Our results indicated that using at least two loci of ITS and TUB2 was sufficient to infer Colletotrichum species complexes. Of 37 isolates, C. gloeosporioides was the most dominant species (19 isolates), followed by C. asianum (10 isolates), C. acutatum (5 isolates), and C. siamense (3 isolates). In Thailand, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been reported to cause anthracnose in mango; however, this is the first report of C. asianum and C. siamense associated with mango anthracnose in central Thailand.

1. Introduction
Mango production has expanded to more than 100 countries, with around 44.6 million tons annually since 2018. Thailand is a major producer, contributing to almost 8% of the global mango production. Because of its flavor and texture, Nam Dok Mai See...
Thong (NDMST) has become the most popular mango cultivar in Thailand. It is also an early-midseason cultivar, which means that it has the potential to produce fruit all year round. Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a significant economic problem in both mango orchards and postharvest storage. The pathogen infects not only fruit but also inflorescences, flowers, and leaves. During the flowering stage, especially under high humidity, a disease incidence of 100% has been observed. Young leaves that emerge during rainy periods are also prone to anthracnose infection. Anthracnose symptoms on leaves appear as small, dark brown spots often surrounded by chlorotic halos and irregular margins. Leaf lesions usually remain small; however, under disease-favorable conditions, the lesions can enlarge and fuse together to form irregular patches. Other symptoms include premature leaf drop and twig dieback. Mango fruit at any stage can be infected. Mummification is usually observed in young fruit, while no symptoms are noted in mature unripe fruit. On ripe fruit, dark brown irregular lesions appear, which gradually increase in size, and under favorable conditions, salmon to orange fungal conidial masses can be observed on the lesions. The application of fungicides is a common practice to control anthracnose in mango orchards in Thailand, although it is often unsuccessful. The inefficient fungicide application is likely due to the emergence of new Colletotrichum species and/or fungicide resistance of the pathogens. Accurate identification of species is a necessary starting point for the effective management of anthracnose disease. Currently, three Colletotrichum species—C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides—have been reported to cause anthracnose in mango. However, the C. gloeosporioides species complex, which includes ubiquitous fungal pathogens in tropical and subtropical areas, has not been reported in Thailand. The host association and morphological characteristics used to identify Colletotrichum species are insufficient to distinguish these pathogens at the species level due to the limited number of morphological characters, and the pathogens are not host-specific. A polyphasic approach, including multilocus phylogenetic analysis alongside recognizable phenotypic characters, has been recommended to accurately identify species within the Colletotrichum genus. According to Weir et al., internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences alone are not reliable for distinguishing different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Additional recommended loci for the identification of Colletotrichum species include actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase-1 (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and β-tubulin (TUB2).
The C. gloeosporioides species complex has not been fully investigated in mango anthracnose in Thailand. We hypothesize that this species complex could be a potential source of new Colletotrichum species. This study used an integrative approach, including morphological assays, multilocus phylogenetic analysis, and pathogenicity tests, to identify species of Colletotrichum infecting the mango cultivar NDMST in Thailand. Here, we report for the first time that C. asianum and C. siamense are causal fungi causing anthracnose in mango grown in central Thailand.
Results
Fungal Isolates
Inflorescences, leaves, and fruit showing typical anthracnose symptoms were collected from orchards located in Chachoengsao, Phichit, and Ratchaburi. Visual anthracnose symptoms included inflorescence blight, small brown to black spots, and irregularly shaped lesions with necrotic areas on leaves. Symptoms on ripe fruit manifested as small black circular spots and irregular, necrotic, sunken lesions. In severely infected fruit, extensive fruit rot was observed, and under high humidity, bright orange to pale colored spore masses were visible. Infected premature fruit were often dropped from the trees. A total of 37 fungal isolates resembling Colletotrichum spp. were obtained.
Morphology-Based Identification
Based on colony morphology and conidia characteristics, the Colletotrichum isolates were classified into two groups. The first group contained five isolates similar to C. acutatum. Colonies grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) appeared white to grey, with a pale ochreous reverse side. Mycelial growth rates at day 3 ranged from 3.33 to 3.77 mm per day (average = 3.56 mm per day). Spore masses were bright orange; conidia were hyaline, aseptate, straight, with an obtuse apex and no setae. The sizes of conidia ranged from 3.38 to 6.17 µm (average = 4.43 µm) in width and from 10.96 to 19.88 µm (average = 14.8 µm) in length. Appressoria were clavate, long, and irregularly shaped, ranging in color from pale to dark brown. The diameter of appressoria ranged from 3.86 to 6.95 µm (average = 5.45 µm) in width and from 5.97 to 11.20 µm (average = 8.36 µm).
The second group contained 32 isolates with similarity to C. gloeosporioides; some of these isolates were later classified as C. asianum or C. siamense when DNA markers were integrated. Colonies grown on PDA exhibited a wide variation in color, from white, greenish, and grayish to pale yellowish and dark grey, while the reverse sides were dark green. Mycelial growth rates varied from 2.13 to 5.43 mm (average = 4.01 mm per day). Conidia were hyaline, aseptate, straight cylindrical, rounded at the apex end, with a conspicuous hilum at the basal end and no setae. The sizes of conidia ranged from 3.60 to 7.07 µm (average = 5.03 µm) in width and from 10.33 to 19.95 µm (average = 14.24 µm) in length. Spore masses were pale, salmon-orange to bright orange. Various shapes of appressoria were observed, including clavate, long clavate, and occasionally irregular, with colors ranging from pale to dark brown. The sizes of appressoria ranged from 4.42 to 8.09 µm (average = 5.82 µm) in width and from 5.53 to 11.59 µm (average = 8.72 µm).

Table 1 provides a collection of the Colletotrichum isolates along with their geographical information. All isolates were obtained from the NDMST cultivar. The table details the location of origin, geographic coordinates, isolate code, and source for each sample. The locations include several areas in Chachoengsao, Phichit, and Ratchaburi provinces, with isolates sourced from fruit, leaves, and inflorescences. Geographic coordinates were determined using GPS status version 8.0.170.
2.2. Morphology-Based Identification
Based on colony morphology and conidia characteristics, the Colletotrichum isolates were classified into two groups. The first group contained five isolates similar to C. acutatum. The colonies grown on PDA appeared white to grey, with the reverse side of the colony being pale ochreous. Mycelial growth rates at day 3 ranged from 3.33 to 3.77 mm per day (average = 3.56 mm per day). Spore masses were bright orange; conidia were hyaline, aseptate, straight, with an obtuse apex and no setae. The sizes of the conidia ranged from 3.38 to 6.17 µm (average = 4.43 µm) in width and from 10.96 to 19.88 µm (average = 14.8 µm) in length. Appressoria were clavate, long, and irregular in shape, varying in color from pale to dark brown. The diameter of appressoria ranged from 3.86 to 6.95 µm (average = 5.45 µm) in width and from 5.97 to 11.20 µm (average = 8.36 µm).
The second group included 32 isolates similar to C. gloeosporioides (some of which were later classified as C. asianum or C. siamense when DNA markers were integrated). The colonies grown on PDA exhibited considerable variation in color, ranging from white, greenish, and grayish to pale yellowish and dark grey, while the reverse sides were dark green. The mycelial growth rates varied from 2.13 to 5.43 mm (average = 4.01 mm per day). Conidia were hyaline, aseptate, straight cylindrical, rounded at the apex, with a conspicuous hilum at the basal end, and no setae. The sizes of the conidia ranged from 3.60 to 7.07 µm (average = 5.03 µm) in width and from 10.33 to 19.95 µm (average = 14.24 µm) in length. Spore masses ranged in color from pale to bright orange. Various shapes of appressoria were observed, including clavate, long clavate, and occasionally irregular, in colors from pale to dark brown. The size of the appressoria ranged from 4.42 to 8.09 µm (average = 5.82 µm) × 5.53 to 11.59 µm (average = 8.72 µm).
2.3. DNA Marker-Based Identification
All DNA sequences of ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 were subjected to
The topology of the maximum likelihood (ML) tree and Bayesian tree were identical; therefore, only the ML tree is shown. A discrete Gamma distribution was used to estimate the divergence and evolutionary rate (+G, parameter = 7.1107). The 37 isolates were assigned to four species clades on the ML tree. Of these, 19 isolates formed a clade closely related to C. gloeosporioides strain, showing a posterior probability of 0.13 with a bootstrap value of 100%. Three isolates clustered with C. siamense, showing a posterior probability of 0.01 and a bootstrap value of 100%. Ten isolates clustered with C. asianum, with a posterior probability of 0.00 and a bootstrap value of 97%. Finally, five isolates were grouped with C. acutatum, with a posterior probability of 0.02 and a bootstrap value of 100%.
The morphological characteristics of colonies grown on PDA at day 3 were documented, with pictures taken from both the front and back of the plates. Appressoria were measured at day 4, and conidia were measured at day 5 after incubation. Representatives of each species included C. acutatum PC011, C. asianum RB001, C. gloeosporioides CS005, and C. siamense RB003.
All DNA sequences of ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 were subjected to BLASTn analysis. Sequences of ex-type or epitype strains of Colletotrichum species were selected for phylogenetic analysis. A phylogenetic tree was first constructed using two DNA markers: ITS and TUB2. A total of 47 isolates, including ten isolates of ex-type and ex-epitype strains, along with Leptosphaeria veronicae CBS145.84 as an outgroup, were used. The incongruence length difference (ILD) test showed that the ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 were homogeneous. Therefore, the concatenated sequences of the four markers were used to generate a phylogenetic tree with a total of 81 isolates, including 44 isolates of ex-type and ex-epitype strains. The topology of the ML tree was consistent with that of the Bayesian tree, so only the ML tree is shown.
Among the 37 isolates, ten clustered with C. asianum strains, showing a posterior probability of 0.97 and bootstrap values of 99%. Three isolates formed a clade with C. siamense strains, with a posterior probability of 0.97 and bootstrap values of 77%. Nineteen isolates clustered with the C. gloeosporioides strain, showing a posterior probability of 1.00 and bootstrap values of 99%. Five isolates clustered with C. acutatum.
The maximum likelihood tree based on a concatenated dataset of ITS and TUB2 sequences of 47 Colletotrichum isolates, including ex-type and epitype strains, was analyzed. The numbers on the nodes represent bootstrap values (left) and posterior probabilities (right). The Colletotrichum isolates from this study are highlighted in grey boxes, and the scale bar indicates the number of substitutions per site. The incongruence length difference (ILD) test demonstrated that the ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 sequences were homogeneous. Consequently, concatenated sequences of these four markers were utilized to generate a phylogenetic tree with a total of 81 isolates, which included 44 ex-type and epitype strains. The topology of the maximum likelihood (ML) tree aligned with that of the Bayesian tree; hence, only the ML tree is presented. Among the 37 isolates analyzed, ten clustered with C. asianum strains (ICMP 18580, ICMP 18696, NN8, WM52, and NN19), exhibiting a posterior probability of 0.97 and bootstrap values of 99%. Additionally, three isolates formed a clade with C. siamense strains (ICMP18578, ICMP17795, ICMP18121, ICMP12567, and ICMP18574), presenting a posterior probability of 0.97 and bootstrap values of 77%. Furthermore, 19 isolates were grouped with the C. gloeosporioides strain (ICMP17821) with a posterior probability of 1.00 and bootstrap values of 99%. Five isolates were associated with C. acutatum (CBS112996, IMI223120, IMI216370, CBS144.29, and CBS979.69), which had a posterior probability of 0.85 and bootstrap values of 99%.
The maximum likelihood tree based on the concatenated dataset of ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 sequences involved a total of 81 Colletotrichum species, with ex-type and epitype strains included. The nodes' numbers indicate bootstrap values (left) and posterior probabilities (right). The Colletotrichum isolates from this study are marked in red, and the scale bar reflects the number of substitutions per site.
A mycelial plug from a 5-day-old culture was inoculated onto unwounded fruit and leaves. Typical anthracnose lesions appeared around the inoculation sites, with the lesions on fruit enlarging more rapidly than those on leaves by day 5 post-inoculation. No lesions were observed on the control fruit or leaves. Among the inoculated fruit, C. asianum resulted in the largest lesions, significantly differing from other species, with an average lesion diameter (LD) of 8.16 cm. This was followed by C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. acutatum, with average LDs of 8.07 cm, 7.81 cm, and 7.61 cm, respectively.
Lesion sizes on NDMST mango fruit and leaves after inoculation by the 37 isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were recorded. The isolates were categorized, showing varied lesion diameters in centimeters for both fruit and leaves. Specific isolates exhibited significantly different lesion sizes, with some isolates having notably larger lesions on fruit compared to leaves, indicating variations in pathogenicity among the Colletotrichum species tested.
The table provides data on various Colletotrichum species and their associated lesion diameters (LD) on NDMST mango. Each row represents a different isolate, with details including the species name and average lesion diameter measured in centimeters. The values are accompanied by letters indicating statistical differences among the treatments. Specifically, C. asianum produced the largest lesions on fruit, averaging 8.16 cm, while C. siamense had the largest lesions on leaves at an average of 1.25 cm. The other species' lesion diameters were notably smaller, showing a significant variance in pathogenicity among the isolates tested.

Typical anthracnose lesions were observed around the inoculation sites, with lesions on fruit enlarging more rapidly than those on leaves by day 5 after inoculation. No lesions appeared on the control fruit or leaves. C. asianum caused the largest lesions on fruit, followed by C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. acutatum. Similar results were observed on leaves, where C. siamense also resulted in the largest lesions. After the pathogenicity test, all Colletotrichum species were re-isolated from the infected tissues and confirmed to have identical morphological characteristics as the original isolates.
It has been widely accepted that high genetic variation within Colletotrichum species complexes exists due to their wide host range and diverse environments. Mango anthracnose has been reported to associate with different species of Colletotrichum. This study aimed to accurately identify the species of the Colletotrichum–mango system in Thailand, using a combination of morphology, multilocus sequence analyses, and Koch’s postulates. A total of 37 Colletotrichum species were isolated from mango anthracnose disease from orchards located in central Thailand. When morphological characteristics such as colony color, growth rate, size, and shape of conidia and appressoria were used, 32 isolates were identified as C. acutatum, and five isolates were identified as C. gloeosporioides. It is generally accepted that morphological characteristics alone are not sufficient for species identification since variation in traits among species can be similar under different environments; therefore, the multilocus phylogenetic approach was integrated to aid in taxonomy. Several DNA markers have been developed to identify Colletotrichum isolates. A multilocus sequence analysis using ITS, CAL, or TUB2 identified C. alienum, C. fructicola, or C. tropicale from other Colletotrichum species. Similarly, a study of lupin anthracnose showed that 39 out of 50 isolates belonged to Colletotrichum lupini. The authors also used a combination of multilocus analysis (ITS, TUB2, GAPDH, and APN/MAT1) and morphological characteristics to support their taxonomic classification of the Colletotrichum species complex. This study used phenotypic characters, DNA markers of ITS, ACT, CHS-1, and TUB2, and Koch’s postulates to confirm that all 37 Colletotrichum isolates were mango anthracnose pathogens. In addition to the four DNA markers used in this study, GAPDH has also been used to identify C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes. In this study, two phylogenetic trees were constructed using two loci (ITS and TUB2) and four loci (ITS, TUB2, ACT, and CHS-1). The topology of both trees was similar and further identified the Colletotrichum species into C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, C. asianum, and C. siamense. These results indicated that using two loci is sufficient to distinguish these four species of Colletotrichum. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were previously reported in 1979 and 2019; however, we have uncovered for the first time that C. asianum and C. siamense caused anthracnose in mango in Thailand. Colletotrichum asianum has been reported to be a major species causing mango anthracnose in China. It has been the most common endophytic species of mango in northeastern Brazil and in many countries around the world, such as Australia, China, Colombia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan. Colletotrichum asianum is also capable of causing disease in avocado (Persea americana Mill.).
The study also included box plots showing the variation of disease lesion diameter among four Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose at 5 days after inoculation with a mycelial plug on unwounded NDMST mango fruit and leaves. Vertical lines represent the median. Means followed by different common letters are significantly different according to the Tukey test. Similar results were observed on inoculated leaves; C. siamense showed the largest lesions, significantly different from other species, with an average lesion diameter of 1.25 cm, whereas the lesion diameter means of C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum were 0.92, 0.71, and 0.38 cm, respectively. After the pathogenicity test, all the Colletotrichum species were re-isolated from the infected tissues and confirmed by Koch’s postulates to have identical morphological characteristics as the

In addition to the four DNA markers used in this study, GAPDH has also been employed to identify C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes. In this study, two phylogenetic trees were constructed using two loci (ITS and TUB2) and four loci (ITS, TUB2, ACT, and CHS-1). The topology of both trees was similar and further identified the Colletotrichum species into C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, C. asianum, and C. siamense. These results indicated that using two loci is sufficient to distinguish these four species of Colletotrichum. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were previously reported in 1979 and 2019; however, we have uncovered for the first time that C. asianum and C. siamense caused anthracnose in mango in Thailand. Colletotrichum asianum has been reported to be a major species causing mango anthracnose in China. It has been the most common endophytic species of mango in northeastern Brazil and in many countries around the world, such as Australia, China, Colombia, Japan, Malaysia, the Philippines, Sri Lanka, and Taiwan. Colletotrichum asianum is also capable of causing disease in avocado (Persea americana Mill.) in Australia. In Thailand, C. asianum has been reported to cause disease in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) but not in mango until this study. Colletotrichum siamense has been reported to be a major species causing mango anthracnose in China and in eastern Australia. It has a wide host range in tropical and subtropical regions and can infect banana (Musa spp.), papaya (Carica papaya L.), dragon fruit (Hylocereus spp.), guava (Psidium guajava), and avocado. It was suggested that C. siamense is likely to be a common and widespread saprophyte or endophyte because it has been isolated from asymptomatic fruit of other plants, except mango and avocado. In Thailand, similar to C. asianum, C. siamense has been reported to cause disease in coffee (Coffea arabica L.) but not in mango until this study.
Among the four species identified, C. gloeosporioides was a major species causing anthracnose in this study. It was found in every orchard from which we isolated samples. The pathogenicity assay showed that all isolates were more aggressive on fruit than leaves, probably because fruit contains more sugar, serving as a carbon source for fungal growth. C. asianum and C. gloeosporioides exhibited a similar degree of aggressiveness on mango fruit, producing larger lesions than C. siamense and C. acutatum. The color of the lesions was also slightly different on inoculated fruit: C. asianum produced dark brown spots, while the other three species produced lighter brown spots. Pathogenicity on leaves indicated that C. siamense was the most aggressive compared to other species, possibly due to species-specific host responses. Further testing using different cultivars of mango should be employed to verify this hypothesis.
The impact of this study was twofold: firstly, it has demonstrated that a combination of morphology, DNA multilocus sequence analysis, and Koch’s postulates is a robust identification approach for species of Colletotrichum. Secondly, our approach enabled the discovery of previously unreported anthracnose caused by C. asianum and C. siamense in Thailand. This discovery raises concerns about the cross-infection potential, as these two species can infect different hosts. Therefore, accurate diagnosis is a crucial first step for disease control and prevention. It supports current quarantine regulations and establishes strategies for integrated management of anthracnose disease between orchards. It should be noted that fungal pathogens, although in the same genus, will respond differently to fungicides. Further study is essential to determine the fungicide sensitivity of these four Colletotrichum species to help implement effective fungicide management strategies.
Infected samples of 25 fruits, 10 leaves, and two inflorescences with typical anthracnose symptoms were collected from eight orchards located in central Thailand: Chachoengsao, Phichit, and Ratchaburi, during 2016–2017. Thirty-seven isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were recovered. The pathogens were isolated and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) using a tissue transplantation technique. To obtain pure isolates, mycelial plugs were sub-cultured on fresh PDA and incubated at 25°C under a photoperiod of 12 hours light and 12 hours dark for 5 days, followed by single spore isolation on water agar (WA). Each single spore from each isolate was transferred to a new PDA plate and incubated under the same conditions. Each colony served as a single genetic source for further analysis.
Each isolate was inoculated with a 6-mm-diameter plug taken from an actively growing edge of a 5-day-old culture on a PDA plate. The culture was incubated under the same conditions mentioned above. Fungal growth and colony diameter were recorded daily until there were no changes in diameter (day 3). Fifty conidia were randomly selected for measurement of their length and width at day 5, when the conidia were fully mature, under an Olympus CX31 binocular compound microscope at 400× magnification with the Olympus CellSens standard software version 1.16. Appressoria were induced using a slide culture technique. The isolates were transferred onto sterile microscope slides and covered with coverslips.
Thermo Fisher Scientific Co., Ltd., Waltham, MA, USA incubated in a petri dish at 25 °C until maturation, usually for 4 days. Lengths and widths of 30 appressoria per isolate were measured under a microscope. This experiment was performed in five replicates.
4.3. DNA Extraction and Molecular Identification
Genomic DNA was extracted from a 5-day-old fungal colony according to Pongpisutta et al. A PCR mixture contained genomic DNA (20 ng), primers (0.48 µM each), Taq polymerase buffer (1×, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA), MgCl2 (2.4 mM), dNTPs (10 µM each), and Taq polymerase (1 U, Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA). PCR was performed in a thermal cycler (Sensoquest GmbH, Göttingen, Germany). The PCR was programmed as follows: 94 °C for 2 min, 35 cycles of denaturation at 94 °C for 30 s, annealing at 55–58 °C for 30 s, and extension at 72 °C for 1 min, with a final extension step of 72 °C for 10 min. The PCR products were visualized on 1.2% agarose gels stained with GelStar® and GeneRuler, and a 100 bp Plus DNA Ladder (Thermo Fisher Scientific, Waltham, MA, USA) was used to determine the size of DNA fragments. The PCR products were sequenced by the 1st Base Laboratory Co., Ltd., Seri Kembangan, Malaysia. A basic local alignment search was performed to analyze nucleotide sequences in comparison to reference sequences available in the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) database.
4.4. Phylogenetic Analyses
Multiple sequence alignments were performed using ClustalW alignment implemented in MEGA version X and were manually adjusted to allow maximum sequence similarity. Bayesian inference (BI) was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees using MrBayes version 3.2.7 implemented in the CIPRES cluster. The nucleotide substitution model was determined by jModelTest v. 2.1.7. Following Drummond and Rambaut, 1,000,000 generations (four chains, four independent runs) were set up, and the analyses were sampled every 1000 generations, with the first 25% of the samples discarded. Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted by MEGA version X using a TN93+G substitution model based on 1000 bootstrap replicates.
4.5. Pathogenicity Test
Harvested mature mango fruit and leaves were washed under running water, immersed in 1.2% sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 min, rinsed twice with sterile distilled water, and allowed to dry under a laminar flow hood. Thirty-seven isolates of Colletotrichum were used for the pathogenicity test. Each Colletotrichum isolate was inoculated on unwounded fruit and leaves as described in Pongpisutta et al. Briefly, a mycelial plug from the growing edge of a 5-day-old PDA culture was placed onto the fruit and leaf surface.
NDMST cultivar. A control treatment was performed using a non-colonized agar plug. The inoculated samples were placed on trays lined with sterile moist paper towels and kept in sealed plastic bags. Five days after inoculation at room temperature, the virulence was evaluated by measuring lesion diameter (LD). This experiment was conducted in a completely randomized design (CRD) with ten replicates. One-way ANOVA was performed using R software version 3.5.2 with the agricolae package (Statistical procedures for agricultural research). The means of the LDs were compared using the least significant difference (LSD) test. Additionally, the variation of disease lesion diameters on NDMST mango fruit and leaves was compared among four Colletotrichum species using box plot analysis, which was also created in R software.
Conclusions: A combination of multilocus phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics, and Koch’s postulates provides an effective strategy to address the identification and characterization of fungal species. We demonstrated that molecular analysis of at least two loci (ITS and TUB2) allows for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease in mango from central Thailand. This study represents the first report that C. asianum and C. siamense were identified as causative agents of mango anthracnose in Thailand.

NDMST cultivar. A control treatment was performed using a non-colonized agar plug. The inoculated samples were placed on trays lined with sterile moist paper towels and kept in sealed plastic bags. Five days after inoculation at room temperature, evaluation of the virulence was performed by measurement of lesion diameter (LD). This experiment was performed in a completely randomized design (CRD) with ten replicates. One-way ANOVA was conducted using R software version 3.5.2 with the agricolae package (Statistical procedures for agricultural research). The means of the LDs were compared by the least significant difference (LSD) test. Additionally, the variation of disease lesion diameters on NDMST mango fruit and leaves was compared among four Colletotrichum species using box plot analysis, which was created in R software as well.
