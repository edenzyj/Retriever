Characterization of Colletotrichum Species Responsible for Anthracnose Diseases of Various Fruits
Filamentous fungi of the genus Colletotrichum and its teleomorph Glomerella are considered major plant pathogens worldwide. They cause significant economic damage to crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by these pathogens. Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as anthracnose, characterized by sunken necrotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases appear in both developing and mature plant tissues. Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has grouped Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly affect aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be impacted. This article focuses on methods used to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species and genotypes from almond, avocado, and strawberry, utilizing traditional and molecular tools. The selected pathosystems represent different disease patterns associated with Colletotrichum.
Numerous cases have been reported in which several Colletotrichum species or biotypes are associated with a single host. For example, avocado and mango anthracnose, caused by both C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, predominantly affect fruit as postharvest diseases. Strawberry may be infected by three Colletotrichum species—C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides—causing anthracnose of fruit and other plant parts. Almond and other deciduous fruits can be infected by C. acutatum or C. gloeosporioides. Citrus can be affected by four different Colletotrichum diseases: postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose, both caused by C. acutatum, and shoot dieback, leaf spot, and postharvest fruit decay, all caused by C. gloeosporioides. Additional hosts affected by multiple Colletotrichum species include coffee, cucurbits, pepper, and tomato.
It is common to find that a single botanical species of Colletotrichum infects multiple hosts. For example, C. gloeosporioides, which is considered a cumulative species and forms a sexual stage in some instances, is found on various fruits, including almond, avocado, apple, and strawberry. Similarly, C. acutatum has been reported to infect a large number of fruit crops, in
Table 1 compares two populations of Colletotrichum isolated from almond fruit in Israel and California. The species found in Israel is C. gloeosporioides, while C. acutatum is present in California. In terms of morphology in culture, the isolates from Israel display a white to gray coloration, whereas those from California are gray to pink. Both populations lack a sexual stage. The optimal growth temperature for the Israeli isolates is between 20 to 22°C, while the Californian isolates prefer a slightly warmer range of 24 to 26°C. The average growth rate on potato dextrose agar at optimal temperatures shows that the Israeli isolates grow at 2.2 mm/day, with a range of 1.6 to 2.8 mm/day, compared to 7.7 mm/day for the Californian isolates, which range from 4.9 to 9.9 mm/day. Both populations infect immature fruit, and both are classified as a single vegetative compatibility grouping. However, the isolates from California are not vegetatively compatible with those from Israel. Additionally, both populations exhibit a single molecular genotype. Regarding benomyl sensitivity, the Israeli isolates are insensitive, while the Californian isolates show sensitivity.
The subsequent discussion highlights the importance of accurately identifying Colletotrichum species to effectively control disease outbreaks. It is essential to understand the epidemiology of these diseases and the specific pathogens associated with various plant tissues. For instance, C. acutatum is linked to postbloom drop in citrus, while C. gloeosporioides mainly acts as a postharvest pathogen. This understanding is critical for developing breeding strategies for disease resistance.
Table 2 presents a comparison of isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from almond and avocado. The almond isolates exhibit a white to gray morphology in culture, while avocado isolates can be white, gray, or black. The sexual stage is absent in almond isolates but present in avocado isolates. The optimal growth temperature for almond isolates is 20 to 22°C, compared to 26 to 28°C for avocado isolates. The average growth rate on potato dextrose agar at optimal temperatures is 2.2 mm/day for almond isolates (ranging from 1.6 to 2.8 mm/day) and 6.4 mm/day for avocado isolates (with a range of 3.8 to 12.0 mm/day). While both populations infect immature fruit, the almond isolates cause dry rot, whereas the avocado isolates affect leaves, twigs, and both immature and mature fruit, leading to soft rot. Furthermore, latent infections are absent in almond isolates but present in avocado isolates. The vegetative compatibility grouping s

Benomyl sensitivity: Insensitive and Sensitive
Traditional methods for identifying species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological differences, such as colony color, size and shape of conidia, optimal temperature, growth rate, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella. However, due to environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the presence of intermediate forms, these criteria are not always adequate for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species. Vegetative compatibility, which controls genetic isolation of populations, has been extensively used to examine genetic relatedness in various plant pathogenic fungi. Vegetative compatibility grouping (VCG) has been applied for subspecies analysis of Colletotrichum species, including C. dematium from spinach, C. orbiculare from cucurbits, C. gloeosporioides from almond, C. graminicola from maize, and C. acutatum from strawberry. Over the past decade, various molecular techniques have successfully complemented the traditional approaches for reliable discrimination among species. For instance, arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR) and polymorphisms in nuclear DNA, ribosomal DNA (rDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and A+T-rich DNA have been utilized to differentiate among populations of C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, C. coccodes, C. fragariae, C. kahawae, C. magna, C. orbiculare, and other species. Additionally, the application of CHEF gel analysis and molecular markers to Australian isolates of C. gloeosporioides on the tropical pasture legume, Stylosanthes spp., indicated the existence of two distinct clonal populations. The genetic complexity of Colletotrichum strains affecting various temperate and tropical fruits has also been demonstrated using these techniques.
In the following sections, we will focus on three pathosystems of anthracnose diseases occurring on the fruit of almond, avocado, and strawberry, which represent different disease patterns of Colletotrichum. Species of the pathogen on almond, a deciduous crop, infect during the initial fruiting stages but do not appear to attack mature fruit or other plant organs. In contrast, avocado is an evergreen crop where anthracnose pathogens cause postharvest decay due to latent or quiescent infections initiating in the field. Unlike almond and avocado, which are perennial, strawberry is predominantly an annual crop. Strawberry anthracnose, caused by C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and/or C. fragariae, leads to serious damage on foliar and fruiting parts, as well as root necrosis. Damage to strawberry crops is not limited to a specific growth period or stor
California is known for areas where strawberry and peach anthracnose occur. The key question is whether the pathogens responsible for anthracnose in these locations are host-specific or if the same pathogen causes disease in the three crops. The methods used to explore this question can also be applied to similar scenarios where a single Colletotrichum species attacks multiple hosts or where multiple Colletotrichum species are found on a single host. The approaches utilized to identify and characterize the anthracnose pathogens in Israel included traditional methods based on morphological criteria and benomyl sensitivity, cross-inoculation of different isolates on various fruits to determine host specificity, vegetative compatibility group (VCG) testing to assess relatedness of isolates within and between species, and molecular analyses to identify Colletotrichum species and characterize subpopulations within species.
The characterization of Colletotrichum species has depended on various criteria, such as morphology, optimal growth temperature, vegetative compatibility, benomyl sensitivity, and molecular techniques. This section discusses the methods used to differentiate isolates of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose on almond, avocado, and strawberry crops in Israel. Traditional methods indicate that conidia of C. acutatum are elliptic-fusiform in shape, while conidia of C. gloeosporioides are oblong with obtuse ends. However, these criteria, along with conidia size, are not consistently reliable for distinguishing species. Many reports indicate that isolates of C. acutatum exhibit a significantly slower growth rate compared to those of C. gloeosporioides. However, the growth rate of C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond in Israel was slow and did not significantly differ from that of C. acutatum from strawberry. In fact, growth rate and optimal temperature have proven useful for differentiating between subpopulations of C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond crops.
Colony shape and color of cultures can vary significantly within and between species. For example, most isolates of C. acutatum show a red-salmon pigmentation in reverse culture, while the coloration of C. gloeosporioides cultures ranges from white to dark gray. Various morphological types have been observed within a population of C. gloeosporioides from avocado. These include conidial types with masses of conidia and no aerial mycelium, flat mycelial types with minimal aerial mycelium or conidia, mycelial types with dense aerial mycelium, conidial-mycelial types with both dense aerial mycelium and masses of conidia, protoperithecial types similar to the conidial-mycelial type but also producing dark protoperithecia-like hyphal aggregate
Glomerella may sometimes help in differentiating between species; however, the sexual stage has only been observed in some isolates of C. gloeosporioides from avocado, but not from almond. In contrast to the morphological heterogeneity observed among the C. gloeosporioides isolates from avocado, the population originating from almond in Israel had uniformly growing white-to-gray colonies. It may be concluded that colony color and shape of conidia are unsatisfactory methods for identification of species, primarily due to the diversity of these characteristics in C. gloeosporioides, which is indicative of its heterogeneity.
Screening for fungicide sensitivity has been used primarily to estimate the potential of such compounds for chemical control. It was found that in some cases, fungicide sensitivity can also be used for species and subspecific grouping in Colletotrichum. In general, C. gloeosporioides isolates are considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum isolates are relatively insensitive. According to our studies, C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond differ in their sensitivity to benzimidazole fungicides: almond isolates are insensitive to benzimidazoles, retaining 40 to 50% growth at 0.5 µg/ml (benomyl), with little further reduction at 50 µg/ml, compared with complete growth inhibition of isolates from avocado at 5 µg/ml. Likewise, C. acutatum isolates from strawberry grown in Israel and California, and from almond grown in California, were insensitive to the mentioned concentrations of benomyl. Additional studies have shown that C. acutatum from almond, peach, and strawberry crops from California is insensitive to benomyl. This simple method can therefore be utilized for further characterization of local populations of Colletotrichum associated with particular anthracnose diseases.
Cross-infection potential has been reported among different species of Colletotrichum and genotypes of C. gloeosporioides on a variety of tropical, subtropical, and temperate fruits under artificial inoculation conditions. For example, isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from various temperate fruits caused visually indistinguishable disease symptoms when inoculated on detached peach fruits. C. gloeosporioides isolates from seven tropical fruit crops were also shown to cross-infect alternate detached leaves and fruits, and the success of infection appeared to be dependent on inoculum density. In studies conducted in Israel, it was of interest to determine whether avocado anthracnose was caused by the same subspecies of C. gloeosporioides as that responsible for almond anthracnose, since almond groves are situated alongside avocado plantations in some cultivation areas. Similarly, other crops, such as anemone, apple, mango, and strawberry, are known to be susceptible to Colletotrichum in Israel. To determine the potential of cross-infection, isolates from different crops were cross-inoculated on various hosts.

Our study showed that C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango, as well as C. acutatum isolates from anemone, apple, and peach, infected detached fruits of various hosts, including two varieties of apple, avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine. These results demonstrated cross-infection potential between two species: C. gloeosporioides (including representatives from almond, apple, avocado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach) on a variety of fruit species. However, these experiments were conducted under extreme conditions commonly used in artificial inoculations, whereas isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence that cross-infection had occurred under field conditions.
Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thereby constituting a distinct genetic population. VCG studies were conducted with isolates of Colletotrichum from almond (from Israel and the United States), avocado (Israel), and strawberry (Israel) crops to determine the genetic relatedness within and between populations. The Israeli isolates of C. gloeosporioides and Californian isolates of C. acutatum from almond belonged to single, distinct VCGs and formed complementary heterokaryons between mutants from different isolates only within each population. Almond isolates from Israel were not compatible with local isolates of Colletotrichum from avocado, indicating that the almond population constitutes a distinct subspecific group within C. gloeosporioides.
On the other hand, C. gloeosporioides from avocado comprises multiple VCGs, and coupled with its diverse morphology, this further indicates heterogeneity within this population. In contrast, isolates of C. acutatum from different plant parts of strawberry, including fruit and roots, originating from various regions were all vegetatively compatible with one another, indicating uniformity and clonality of the local pathogen population. Although the VCG method cannot be used for the taxonomic classification of Colletotrichum species, it is useful for delineating asexually reproducing subpopulations within species.
Molecular techniques have gained popularity over the last decade, as traditional methods have not been satisfactory for differentiating between species and subspecies of Colletotrichum. Molecular methods have been successfully employed to differentiate populations of Colletotrichum from many hosts, particularly from almond, avocado, and strawberry. Ribosomal DNA (rDNA) analysis was conducted, as rDNA genes appear as multiple copies in the genome. The non-transcribed and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA subunits exhibit less conservation of sequence, making them suitable for detecting recent evolutionary divergence within Colletotri
Species-specific primers have been designed primarily according to dissimilarities in the sequence of the ITS regions of representative isolates of Colletotrichum from different species. We have used such primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. A single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range, but not in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, using primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae, isolates of these two species were similar to one another but could be distinguished from those of C. acutatum by amplification of a specific 450-bp fragment. This method also made it possible to distinguish between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry on the one hand, and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus on the other. These results demonstrate that rDNA analysis is adequate as a taxonomic tool for species identification and for diagnostic pathogen detection in planta, but not for revealing subpopulations within a species.
Polymorphisms in nuclear DNA have been explored through repetitive DNA elements, which have been useful for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) grouping of various isolates of Colletotrichum species. For example, a repetitive nuclear DNA element (GcpR1), originally from the bean anthracnose pathogen C. lindemuthianum, was successfully used to differentiate among ten species of Colletotrichum by producing unique polymorphic patterns for each representative species. When GcpR1 was used to compare C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado in Israel, the band patterns of the almond isolates were uniform and distinct from those of avocado isolates. Within the avocado isolates, polymorphic fragments were observed in accordance with the morphological and VCG heterogeneity of this population.
The analysis of A+T-rich DNA associated with mitochondrial (mt) DNA can be detected by the restriction enzyme HaeIII, which recognizes and cleaves the DNA sequence GGCC. A+T-rich DNA is cleaved infrequently by HaeIII; whereas most of the nuclear DNA is digested to fragments of less than 2 kb in size. HaeIII RFLPs of A+T-rich DNA were successfully used to characterize Colletotrichum isolates from ten species, whereby each representative revealed unique restriction patterns. The results of this approach were similar to those obtained using the GcpR1 repetitive element, where C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond exhibited unique band patterns, contrasting with polymorphic fragments observed for avocado isolates. This method also facilitated the grouping of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach, as well as differentiation among *C. glo
PCR was performed using primers derived from minisatellite or repeat sequences (CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG, TGTCTGTCTGTCTGTC, GACACGACACGACAC, GACAGACAGACAGACA) to compare Colletotrichum species from almond, avocado, strawberry, and other fruits. Unique band patterns were observed among the clonal populations of C. acutatum from strawberry and C. gloeosporioides from almond, while avocado isolates exhibited polymorphisms. Arbitrarily primed PCR (ap-PCR) was utilized to accurately differentiate among C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae from strawberry. It was found that C. acutatum and C. fragariae populations shared a common band pattern, while C. gloeosporioides displayed polymorphic patterns. This method effectively identified strawberry isolates from South Carolina as C. acutatum based on unique amplification products, assessed the uniformity of Israeli C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, and illustrated heterogeneity within the species as demonstrated by multiple band patterns. Varying band patterns indicated that C. acutatum isolates from various hosts, including anemone, almond, apple, peach, pecan, and strawberry, collectively represent three genotypes, revealing significant heterogeneity within this species.
In summary, rDNA analysis is a reliable method for taxonomic species identification, while methods such as analysis using GcpR1 and other repetitive DNA elements, A+T-rich DNA RFLPs, and ap-PCR are effective for determining subpopulation diversity within species.
Regarding the effect of teleomorphism on genetic diversity, although C. gloeosporioides infects hundreds of different plant species, individual strains may have restricted host ranges, as seen in the clonal subpopulation of C. gloeosporioides from almond grown in Israel. It is often assumed that host-specific populations reproduce asexually; however, certain isolates with different host specificities have been shown to mate under laboratory conditions. Highly variable populations are more adaptable to changing conditions than those with little variation, and sexual reproduction and recombination are major contributors to the genetic variability observed in fungal populations. C. gloeosporioides is highly variable, evidenced by its morphological characteristics and molecular markers. It has been noted that C. gloeosporioides from avocado is genetically complex. Additionally, some strains from avocado can produce the sexual stage in culture, suggesting they may also reproduce through their G. cingulata teleomorph stage in the orchard.
These findings contrast with the uniform genotype and single vegetative compatibility groups (VCGs) found among C. gloeosporioides from almond and C. acutatum from strawberry, which reproduce solely through vegetative means. The data suggest that recombination of vegetative incompatibility and other loci during sexual reproduction contributes to a high degree of genetic variation among C. gloeosporioides strains on avocado. Alternatively, the population may consist of numerous vegetatively reproducing clones. These two reproductive strategies are not mutually exclusive and may coexist.
In conclusion, Colletotrichum is a broad-range pathogen that exhibits cases of multiple species on a single host and
PCR amplified genomic DNA from isolates of Colletotrichum from various hosts using primers (A) (CAG)5 and (B) (GACA)4 represented as follows: CA (C. acutatum from strawberry, California); CF (C. fragariae from strawberry, Mississippi); CG-1 and CG-2 (C. gloeosporioides from strawberry, Florida); PCN-3 and PCN-4 (C. gloeosporioides from pecan, Louisiana); PCN-5 (C. acutatum from pecan, Alabama); PCH-13 (C. gloeosporioides from peach, South Carolina); SF-7 (C. acutatum from peach, South Carolina); STR-2 and STR-3 (C. acutatum from strawberry, South Carolina); APL-7 (C. gloeosporioides from apple, North Carolina); ALM-B, ALM-G, ALM-I, and ALM-K (C. gloeosporioides from almond, Israel); and AVO-1 and AVO-5 (C. gloeosporioides from avocado, Israel). Lanes M contain DNA size markers in kilobases.
In this article, we have emphasized that certain populations of Colletotrichum appear to be host-specific, such as C. gloeosporioides from almond in Israel. However, in other geographic regions, the same host may be attacked by additional species, as recently demonstrated with C. acutatum causing almond anthracnose in California. Numerous reports have determined that cross-infection potential exists among different species of Colletotrichum on a multitude of hosts. These studies were mainly conducted on detached plant material, such as fruit and leaves. Although artificial host inoculation is usually not reliable enough for assessing host specificity, it indicates the potential for infection. Our studies have emphasized this point, showing that C. gloeosporioides from almond grown in Israel was able to infect various fruits under artificial inoculation conditions, but isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence that cross-infection had occurred under field conditions.
The fact that Colletotrichum species differ in their sensitivity to certain fungicides, such as benomyl, is critical for chemical pathogen control. This should be taken into account when implementing a spray program where a mixed population exists, such as C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides in apple, citrus, mango, peach, pecan, and strawberries, since differential sensitivity may result in a shift in population ratio. The use of traditional methods (morphology, colony color, conidia size, etc.) may not be accurate enough for the identification of species and subspecies, which is critical for disease management, resistance breeding, and pathogen control. Vegetative compatibility and molecular approaches offer complementary means for characterization of species. Molecular approaches have been utilized successfully for taxonomic ident
Many anthracnose-susceptible hosts are cultivated worldwide. Damage to yield is especially significant in the tropics, where multiple hosts such as mango, avocado, coffee, papaya, banana, and citrus are grown in close proximity. Therefore, the complexity related to host range and specificity in the genus Colletotrichum must be determined for each host at every given location. Future research should aim to determine host specificity of Colletotrichum species primarily based on natural infections rather than artificial inoculations. While artificial infections are relatively easy to obtain on detached leaves and ripe fruit under controlled laboratory conditions, such experiments often employ high inoculum levels along with optimized humidity and temperature. Consequently, their results may not accurately reflect the true virulence potential.
The taxonomy of Colletotrichum species is in a state of constant flux and remains confusing, particularly concerning the species C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, which attack several hosts. Due to their broad and sometimes overlapping host ranges, as well as their phenotypic and genotypic heterogeneity, these species are considered cumulative, consisting of diverse subpopulations. Traditional methods for classifying these fungi into distinct species are primarily based on morphological criteria. However, deviations from type-culture characteristics and the presence of intermediate forms have introduced ambiguity into species identification. The validity of these mycotaxons as “mycological species” is beyond the scope of this article but appears significant from a phytopathological perspective.
Among the molecular approaches mentioned, the use of species-specific primers for PCR amplification of unique rDNA fragments seems most promising for differentiating among the species of Colletotrichum. Given that PCR-based methods are relatively straightforward, this approach should be further developed by adjusting the available primers and designing new ones for unequivocal identification of all problematic species. The reliability of these primers should be validated by testing them with Colletotrichum strains representing diverse populations of each species. Although subpopulations have been recognized within C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, their taxonomic status remains unclear. From a phytopathological viewpoint, the considerable pathogenic variation evident within these species—often accompanied by additional phenotypic variation—may warrant further dissection into subspecific groups to reflect host specificity. Ideally, the species name should refer to a broad grouping, with strains from the subspecies level indicating host specialization. The general acceptability of such subgrouping may require additional support based on biological criteria independent of pathogenicity. Molecular and VCG analyses are likely candidates to provide the necessary information. Molecular approaches have been widely employed, demonstrating significant power for characterization.
The interspecies band patterns of arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (AP-PCR) amplified genomic DNA from isolates of Colletotrichum show variations among strains derived from different hosts. Each strain is associated with specific regions, highlighting their genetic diversity and potential host specialization. The figure includes various isolates from sources like strawberry,
Isolates are well recognized in plant disease research. However, the applicability of various techniques for the overall delineation of subspecific subpopulations has yet to be determined. In particular, the ability to accurately identify phenotypically similar strains from diverse sources and to separate them from other phenotypes using molecular markers must be demonstrated. VCG analysis, commonly used to study formae speciales of Fusarium oxysporum, has only been applied in a few cases to determine the population structure in Colletotrichum spp. Identification of species using this method is confined to populations that are vegetatively compatible with well-defined reference strains. Within species, subdivision by VCG has proven to be reliable, as evidenced by correlations with genotypes and phenotypic traits. VCG determination is based on multi-locus controlled self/nonself discrimination between fungal strains, and its results are clear-cut in most cases. It is only applicable to anamorphic, clonally related populations. In sexually reproducing populations with a Glomerella stage, relationships can be determined by sexual compatibility, which is the ultimate criterion for delineating mating populations within a species. Unlike DNA-based methods, tests based on VCG and sexual crosses employ living fungi. Consequently, strains to be compared may need to be moved from one geographic location to another, creating a risk of undesired pathogen dissemination. Additional work should focus on linking molecular markers to biological traits, such as morphology, VCG, and virulence. There is no biological significance to PCR-amplified bands from random primers that are unrelated to functional genes. However, RAPDs can still retain their importance in population genetics studies at the subspecies level. Recent observations of the teleomorph of C. acutatum from apple and blueberry in the southeastern United States indicate that multiple genotypes of C. acutatum exist, with isolates of the species appearing on various hosts. Although clonal populations have been observed (e.g., on strawberries in Israel), it remains to be seen whether the presence of the sexual stage may significantly contribute to genetic diversity within C. acutatum, similar to the hypotheses regarding C. gloeosporioides.
