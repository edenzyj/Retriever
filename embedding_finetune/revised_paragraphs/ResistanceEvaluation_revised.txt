ABSTRACT
Strawberry Anthracnose Fruit Rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to the restrictions associated with fungicide applications across strawberry fields, their adverse effects on the environment, and the potential development of fungicide resistance among fungal strains of the pathogen, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. In this study, reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars were evaluated against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes strawberry AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. The results indicated that the strawberry cultivars exhibited different reactions to the disease depending on the inoculation of their leaf, fruit, and crown with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. However, the fruit-based assay was a better indicator of AFR disease susceptibility due to the nature of the disease caused by C. nymphaeae. Overall, the ‘Blakemore’ and ‘Kurdistan’ cultivars were significantly more resistant compared to others, except for ‘Aliso’, ‘Mrak’, ‘Diamant’, ‘Yallova’, ‘New Kurdistan’, ‘Mac Donance’, and ‘Ten Beauty’. Conversely, the ‘Gaviota’ cultivar was significantly the most susceptible, followed closely by ‘Camarosa’. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including ‘Camarosa’, ‘Paros’, ‘Pajaro’, and ‘Queen Eliza’, were categorized on the list of susceptible and highly susceptible cultivars in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of some commercial strawberry cultivars against C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.

INTRODUCTION
Strawberry (Fragaria×ananassa Duch.) is a widely grown hybrid species in the family Rosaceae, which is globally appreciated for its fruit. Strawberry is becoming a m
Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992), includes three main fungal pathogens of C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae, all of which are responsible for causing anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). Crown rot is typically caused by C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae infections, while fruit rot is mainly caused by C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). To date, a considerable number of species have been described within the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as being associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Colletotrichum nymphaeae is the most widespread pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). No chemical control methods are currently effective for managing strawberry anthracnose, and their use is limited to preventive treatments before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of environmental chemical fungicides and the development of resistance among fungal strains are critical issues. Therefore, using resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical strategy for controlling anthracnose. Given the recent outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry fields of Kurdistan province, Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the need for appropriate strategies to address this challenge, the aim of this study was to assess the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.
Materials and Methods
Field Surveys and Sampling
An extensive survey was conducted in strawberry fields across the Kurdistan province of Iran, focusing on counties with significant strawberry production, including Sanandaj, Mariwan, Kamyaran, and Sarvabad. Typical symptoms of anthracnose disease, such as leaf spots, stem necrosis, and fruit rot, were monitored, and samples from affected plant parts were collected and transferred to the laboratory in sterile boxes.
Pathogen Isolation and Identification
Lesion edges of infected plant parts were disinfected in 1%

Strawberry Cultivars and Anthracnose Fruit Rot
Strawberry fruits were surface-sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 seconds, followed by 70% ethanol for 30 seconds, and then rinsed three times in sterile distilled water. They were allowed to dry on sterile paper under a laminar flow hood. A conidial suspension (1×10^6 conidia mL^-1) of each isolate, containing Tween 80 (0.1%; v/v), was placed on each fruit, with five fruits per treatment. Sterile distilled water containing 0.1% Tween 80 was used as the untreated control. After 7 days, disease incidence and severity were assessed based on the disease index as described by Karimi et al. (2017). To calculate disease severity, the total surface area of each strawberry fruit was estimated, with the fruit imagined as having a conical shape. The rate of disease severity was calculated using the formula: t/T × 100, where (t) is the infected area and (T) is the total area of each strawberry fruit. All strawberry cultivars used in this study were obtained from the strawberry collection of Kurdistan Agricultural and Natural Resources Research and Education Center, Sanandaj, Iran.
Detached Leaf Assay
Detached untreated leaves of selected commercial strawberry cultivars were initially surface-sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 30 seconds and then in 70% ethanol, followed by rinsing three times in sterile distilled water. The leaves were dried on sterile paper under a laminar hood before inoculation. Inoculation was performed as described by Karimi et al. (2019). Depending on leaf size, four to 12 wounds were made on the adaxial surface of each leaf using a sterile sharp needle. A plug of 5 mm from a seven-day-old fungal culture of C. nymphaeae PET1 was placed on the wounds of each leaf. After inoculation, leaves were kept in plastic containers with moistened filter papers at 23°C to maintain high relative humidity (> 95%). Five detached leaves were inoculated for each fungal strain, with pathogen-free PDA plugs serving as the control. After 8 days, the affected area on the leaf surface was measured using image analysis software for the calculation of disease severity.
Detached Fruit Assay
Detached untreated fruits of each cultivar were inoculated with the conidial suspension of C. nymphaeae PET1 at a concentration of 1×10^6 conidia mL^-1 containing Tween 80 (0.1%; v/v), as described in the pathogenicity test. Six fruits were inoculated for each cultivar. After 7 days, disease incidence and severity were calculated based on the previously mentioned index.
Greenhouse Assay
In the greenhouse, crowns of one-year-old strawberry plants were injected with C. nymphaeae PET1 to produce crown rot symptoms in different cultivars. A conidial suspension of C. nymphaeae PET1 containing Tween 80 (0.1%; v/v), adjusted to 1×10^6 conidia mL^-1, was injected into the crown tissue of each cultivar using a sterile syringe. Four plants per cultivar were inoculated, with plants injected with sterile distilled water serving as the negative control. After inoculation, plants were initially kept under high humidity (> 92%) with a 16-hour light/8-hour darkness cycle at 26°C for 48 hours. The plants were then transferred to a greenhouse with a 12-hour photoperiod at 26°C for four months. The appearance of crown rot symptoms was assessed based on the following disease index: 0 = Healthy plant with no visible lesions; 1 = Plant with petiole lesions < 3 mm long; 2 = Plant with petiole lesions 3-10 m

Statistical Analyses
Data were statistically analyzed as a Completely Randomized Design (CRD) using standard Analysis of Variance (ANOVA). The means were compared with critical difference and presented as mean ± Standard Error (SE). All analyses were conducted using SAS software (SAS Institute, Inc., 2003).
RESULTS AND DISCUSSION
During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms associated with anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), while other symptoms, including flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants, were also noted. These observations were consistent with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From the symptomatic plant tissues, a total of eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained, with six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Based on macroscopic characteristics (white to grey colony with an average growth rate of 60 mm after 7 days) and microscopic features (absence of sexual forms, sclerotia, chlamydospores, and setae; conidia measuring 15.25–17.75 × 3.9–5 µm, unicellular, hyaline, smooth-walled, and cylindrical to fusiform, mostly with acute or one end acute and one end round), the identity of all fungal isolates on PDA was determined as C. nymphaeae. This finding further corroborates C. nymphae
However, based on optical comparisons, the C. nymphaeae strain PET1 was selected for further use in our examinations. Colletotrichum nymphaeae is also the predominant causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in other countries, including the USA and UK. Furthermore, it appears that broadleaf weeds can act as reservoirs for the pathogen inoculum. This evidence reveals the need for a better understanding of disease epidemiology to improve management strategies.
In this study, distinct levels of resistance to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) were revealed in trials involving detached leaves, fruit, and crown-based assays. Fruit, leaf, and crown infections were confirmed by re-isolation of the pathogen in all assays. In the detached leaf assay, the cultivars ‘Missionary’, ‘New Kurdistan’, ‘Ventana1’, ‘Ventana’, and ‘Blakemore’ significantly exhibited the most resistance to the disease compared with other cultivars, except for ‘Ten Beauty’, ‘N. Selva’, ‘Chandler’, ‘Aliso’, ‘Fresno’, ‘Mac Donance’, ‘Gaviota’, ‘Dachnitsa’, ‘Aromas’, and ‘Mrak’. The most susceptible cultivar was ‘Camarosa’, followed by ‘Selva’, ‘Paros’, ‘Diamant’, ‘Karcynberg’, ‘Kurdistan’, ‘Pajaro’, ‘Queen Eliza’, ‘Sequia’, and ‘Yallova’.
In the detached fruit assay, AFR appeared on all fruits from different cultivars. However, disease severity varied significantly between cultivars. ‘Blackmore’ and ‘Kurdistan’ were significantly the most resistant cultivars to AFR compared with other cultivars, including ‘Aliso’, ‘Mrak’, ‘Diamant’, ‘Yallova’, ‘New Kurdistan’, ‘Mac Donance’, and ‘Ten Beauty’.
The reactions of various commercial strawberry cultivars to the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae causing strawberry anthracnose fruit rot were assessed through different assays. The results indicated a range of disease severity and incidence among the cultivars tested, with some cultivars exhibiting significantly higher resistance while others displayed susceptibility. Specific metrics such as disease severity (DS) and disease incidence (DI) were recorded for detached fruit assays, detached leaf assays, and crown infection assays, highlighting the differences in cultivar responses to the pathogen.
Beuty, respectively. On the contrary, ‘Gaviota’ was highly susceptible to the disease significantly compared with the other cultivars besides ‘Camarosa’. In the greenhouse assay, the occurrence of anthracnose symptoms in strawberry plants inoculated with C. nymphaeae PET1 was considerably low after four months. Statistical comparisons revealed no significant difference between strawberry cultivars in terms of disease incidence and severity. Only one replication of each treatment (cultivar) showed anthracnose crown rot in the greenhouse. In fact, the wilting and sudden death of the strawberry plant caused by anthracnose crown rot develops and progresses slowly and could start after 30 days of inoculation. In this study, wilting and sudden death syndromes were recorded, but different degrees of mild crown rot (brown spots) were ignored. However, latent infection in strawberry farms has been reported earlier. Moreover, a variation in aggressiveness of different isolates of C. acutatum as a complex species, and even in C. nymphaeae isolates, has been previously proven. In all replicates of each treatment, despite the high occurrence of the disease in leaf and fruit-based assays, no linear correlation was detected between these assays in terms of disease severity. Overall, different and non-identical reactions of cultivars to the disease were detected in detached leaf, fruit, and crown-based assays. For instance, ‘Blackmore’ was found to be a resistant cultivar in detached fruit assays, whereas in detached leaf assays, it was susceptible. However, the indigenous cultivars of ‘Kurdistan’ and ‘New Kurdistan’ were categorized as relatively resistant in both assays. On the contrary, most cultivars showed no crown infection in the greenhouse trial. These results were in agreement with other studies where the susceptibility to anthracnose fruit rot of different organs of a cultivar, including fruit, leaf, and root, was different, and no relationship was detected between the susceptibility of different cultivars and different organs of one cultivar. Furthermore, the presence of the pathogen may cause no symptoms on the foliage, and a latent infection occurs. Overall, similar to previous findings, our results show that the detached fruits assay is a better indicator of anthracnose fruit rot disease susceptibility, although other methods could be useful for better understanding of the disease epidemiology. In this study, most commercial cultivars, including ‘Paros’, ‘Queen Eliza’, ‘N. Selva’, and ‘Camarosa’, which are widely grown in strawberry fields of Iran, were categorized as susceptible. Therefore, it seems that the deployment of relatively resistant cultivars such as ‘Blackmore’, ‘Aliso’, ‘Mark’, ‘Diamant’, and ‘Yallova’ could be useful in preventing disease development in areas where the disease is epidemic. Furthermore, the cultivars with relative resistance can be crossed with commercial cultivars in breeding programs to improve and develop resistant cultivars. To the best of our knowledge, this study is the first attempt to evaluate the reaction of some commercial strawberry cultivars against C. nymphaeae causing strawberry anthracnose fruit rot.
