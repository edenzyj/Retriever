Introduction
For successful pathogenicity, fungi employ various infection strategies to breach the host cuticle. While some pathogens use mechanical means through the formation of specialized infection structures, others enter by direct penetration of the cuticle with the assistance of extracellular cutinase activity. Colletotrichum truncatum, a pathogen of legumes, cereals, grasses, and vegetable crops such as Capsicum species, is an ascomycete that infects its host by direct penetration through the host cuticle. The process of infection and penetration is thought to be triggered by cutin-degrading enzymes such as cutinase. Cutinases from many fungi have been isolated and characterized. They have been suggested to participate in carbon acquisition for saprophytic growth and are presumed to play a role in fungal penetration and surface adhesion.
However, the importance of cutinase in the pathogenesis of fungi remains controversial, as disruption of the cutinase gene in various fungi has resulted in contradictory outcomes. For instance, the overexpression of MfCut1 in Monilinia fructicola increased pathogenicity on Prunus spp., while targeted gene replacement of cutinases in Magnaporthe grisea and Pyrenopeziza brassicae dramatically reduced pathogenicity on rice, barley, and oilseed rape hosts, respectively. Conversely, disruption of cutinase in other fungi, such as Nectria haematococca and Botrytis cinerea, revealed no significant alteration in pathogenicity compared to their wild-type and control counterparts. The relevance of the cutinase gene in the fungal pathogenicity of C. truncatum, however, has not yet been identified. Cutinase is proposed to be the hydrolyzing agent of the plant cuticle and/or an elicitor of cutin monomers that trigger signaling pathways within fungal pathogens.
Despite the identification of cutinase in a range of Colletotrichum species, such as C. gloeoesporioides, C. kahawae, C. trifolii, C. lagenarium, and C. capsici, the characterization of the gene and its function in the C. truncatum-chili interaction remains unelucidated. Analysis of gene function has traditionally been performed through conventional methods, such as examining phenotypic or biochemical changes in response to mutations of the gene of interest. However, this process can be laborious and time-consuming.
Furthermore, the vast wealth of information provided by the increasing sequencing of fungal species genomes necessitates an efficient method to link genetic information to biological function with greater accuracy. This has led to the development of alternative methods, such as RNA-mediated gene silencing. RNA-mediated gene silencing is a powerful tool for functional analysis of genes. Initially discovered in Caenorhabditis elegans, the strategy has now been applied to a variety of organisms across different kingdoms. Known as Post Transcriptional Gene Silencing (PTGS) in plants, RNA interference (RNAi) in animals, and quelling in fungi, this phenomenon exploits the endogenous gene regulatory mechanisms of eukaryotic cells.

Abstract
The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified and cloned, showing its essential role in breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, demonstrating its impact on fungal pathogenicity. The vector pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1, was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced infection patterns, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (and CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were less effective in infecting detached chili and soybean hosts than the wild type, and there was a delay in the infection period of the transformants. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. The knowledge of plant-fungal interactions emerged from the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, providing an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly of essential pathogenicity genes.

The integrity and quantity of total RNA were confirmed by 1.5% agarose gel electrophoresis and a 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder. First strand cDNA synthesis was performed using the Omniscript RT-PCR Kit and the oligo-dT primer according to the manufacturer's protocol. Gene transcripts were evaluated by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) using Cut1F and Cut1R primers, designed based on orthologues of fungal cutinase. The GAPDH gene was used to normalize the expression levels of the studied gene. A total of three replications were conducted for the experiment. Genomic DNA was extracted from fungal mycelium using the DNeasy Plant Mini kit, following the manufacturer's protocol. PCR was conducted to amplify the cutinase gene in C. truncatum F8-3B using gCUT-F and gCUT-R primers. The PCR reaction components consisted of 20 ng genomi
Polymerase (Scientifix, Australia) was used in a total volume of 25 µl. Conditions for amplification included an initial denaturation stage at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 60°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 30 seconds, with a final elongation step at 72°C for 5 minutes to ensure that any remaining single-stranded DNA was fully extended. The PCR reaction was performed using a PTC-100™ Programmable Thermal Controller (MJ Research, Inc, USA). Both PCR products derived from the cDNA and genomic DNA were cloned and sequenced (AGRF, Australia). Sequence alignment was generated using the CLUSTALW (1.81) Multiple Sequence Alignments program. Sequence analysis was conducted using BLAST (Basic Local Alignment Search Tool). Six-frame translations on the nucleotide sequence were performed using the SDSC Biology Workbench 3.2. A homology search was executed at the nucleotide and protein levels using BLASTN, and double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) is cleaved by a nuclease (Dicer) of the RNase III family into Smaller Interfering RNAs (siRNAs) of 21 to 28 nucleotides in length. These siRNAs are incorporated into a ribonucleoprotein complex that forms the RNA-Induced Silencing Complex (RISC). The RISC recognizes homologous mRNAs through complementary base pairing and triggers sequence-specific degradation of the homologous mRNA. Studies on gene function through specific inhibition of pathogenicity or plant-fungal interaction gene expression using RNA-mediated gene silencing have been reported in many ascomycete fungi, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Magnaporthe oryzae, and Colletotrichum lagenarium. However, such a silencing mechanism has not yet been employed in C. truncatum to understand pathogenicity. The aim of this paper was to identify functional cutinase genes in C. truncatum and determine whether the cutinase gene, CtCut1, plays a role in pathogenicity. Utilizing a short (515 bp) cDNA fragment of CtCut1 as the target for gene silencing by RNAi, the efficacy of the pAA1 plasmid harboring the hairpin RNA cassette as a mediator for gene silencing was examined. Coupled with an established Agrobacterium tumefaciens-Mediated Transformation (ATMT) system for C. truncatum, the RNA-mediated gene silencing approach was successfully applied to study the function of the C. truncatum cutinase gene in response to contact with its hosts.
Materials and Methods
Colletotrichum truncatum pathotype F8-3B and its transformant expressing GFP, which caused anthracnose disease in chili (Capsicum spp.), were grown and maintained on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA; Difco Laboratories, France) at 24°C with a 12-hour photoperiod. The medium for the GFP-tagged F8-3B transformant was supplemented with 250 µg/ml of hygromycin B antibiotic. Conidiospores obtained from 14-day-old cultures were adjusted to 10^6 conidiospores/ml and used as the recipient in all transformation experiments. Genomic DNA/RNA extraction was carried out on fungal mycelium grown in 50 ml of Czapek-Dox broth (CDB; Difco Laboratories, France) for 7 days under the same temperature and photoperiod until a mycelial mat was formed. Agrobacterium tumefaciens strain AGL1, used as the donor for fungal transformation, was grown and maintained in Luria Bertani (LB) broth containing 5 mM glucose (LBG; Sigma Aldrich, USA) at 28°C. One Shot® TOP10 Chemically Competent Escherichia coli (Invitrogen, Australia), used as the host for gene manipulation, was maintained in LB broth at 37°C.
For pathogenicity assays, Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang plants were established in pots in a glasshouse and grown under controlled conditions of light (18 h photoperiod), temperature (28°C), and humidity (60-70%). One-month-old Glycine max genotype Bragg soybean plants were also established in pots and maintained in the glasshouse.
Total RNA was extracted from saprophytic stage (growing in CDB) and pathogenic stage (2, 6, and 24 hours post-inoculation) mycelium using the RNeasy Plant Mini kit. The RNA extraction was performed following the manufacturer’s instructions. Contaminating genomic DNA in all RNA samples was removed by DNase I treatment at room temperature for 30 minutes.
The following primers were used in the study:
Restriction sites are bolded in lower case letters.
Vector construction and fungal transformation involved generating two binary vectors, designated as pJF1_ShhGFP and pAA1, for RNA-mediated gene silencing. The sGFP cassette driven by the ToxA promoter from the pJF1 plasmid was removed by digestion at the HindIII-EcoRI site, forming an open plasmid for cloning a desired fragment. A 1354-bp DNA fragment containing the regulatory sequences and the sense and antisense of GFP, interrupted by C. truncatum cutinase intron, was synthesized and cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI digested site of pJF1, resulting in the pJF1_ShhGFP fungal silencing plasmid. The second fungal silencing vector, pAA1, was constructed by cloning the sense and antisense strand of the cutinase cDNA into SmaI-XhoI and BamHI-XbaI sites of the pJF1_ShhGFP plasmid. The internal cutinase fragment (17 bp to 532 bp) was amplified with specific primers to generate the sense and antisense strands. Amplifications were performed in two separate reactions with C. truncatum cutinase DNA as the template.

The nucleotide sequence of the cutinase gene is available from the NCBI database (Accession no. HQ406775). b) Plasmid map of pAA1.
The pAA1 plasmid was cloned using BamHI and XbaI enzymes and named pAA1AS. The amplified sense fragment was then digested with SmaI at 25°C for 16 hours, followed by digestion with XhoI at 37°C for another 16 hours. This fragment was cloned into the SmaI-XhoI site of the pAA_CutAS plasmid, resulting in the creation of the pAA_CutASS plasmid, which was later named pAA1. Fourteen-day-old germinated conidiospores transformants expressing GFP were transformed with pJF1_ShhGFP, while the wild type was transformed with pAA1, both using the ATMT method as described. The strains were selected on PDA containing 250 µg/ml hygromycin B antibiotic. Since the transformant expressing GFP shared the same selection marker (hygromycin B) as the current pJF1_ShhGFP transformant, double-transformed individuals could not be selected on the selective medium. Subsequent analyses were conducted only on single-spored putative transformants of pAA1, known as F8-3B-pAA1 transformants, while pJF1-ShhGFP transformants served as controls.
Microscopy was performed on the mycelium and conidiospores of putative F8-3B-pAA1 transformants containing the inverted repeat cassette within the T-DNA insert, using a Leica DMRBE microscope. The lack of GFP expression confirmed the success of the inverted repeat (hairpin) structure formation in the pAA1 plasmid. Similarly, mycelium and conidiospores derived from infected fruits and leaves in the pathogenicity assays were examined for GFP expression. Successful transformants were those showing no GFP expression. All specimens were placed on a glass slide with a water droplet, covered with a cover slip, and observed under the microscope. Images were captured using a Leica DC300F digital camera with Leica IM50 v.4 software. Wild type F8-3B and transformants expressing GFP were used as controls.
PCR and Southern blot analyses were conducted to confirm the presence of T-DNA in ten putative F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F1, F2.1, F2.2, F4, F5.1, F5.2, F7, F8, F9, and F10) by amplifying an internal 544 bp region of the hph gene using hphF and hphR primers. Putative transformants F2.1 and F2.2, and F5.1 and F5.2 were derived from separate single spores of the same transformation event for each isolate. Another PCR was performed with the 207 bp region of the sgfp gene using the primers SmaI-CutS-F and S-GFP-R.
Southern blot analysis was performed to confirm the copy number of the endogenous cutinase gene in the wild type and the integration of T-DNA containing the hairpin cassette in the transformed fungal genome. Transformed fungal genomic DNA was extracted using a DNA extraction method that utilizes a high SDS concentration. A total of 8 µg genomic DNA was digested with 20 U HindIII at 37°C for 8 hours. The pAA1 plasmid was prepared using HindIII and EcoRI restriction enzymes. Fragments were separated on a 1.0% agarose gel and transferred to a positively charged nylon membrane. A 540-bp cutinase probe was generated by PCR using the SmaI CutS-F and XbaI-CutS-R primers, labeled with digoxigenin (DIG) according to the DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit II protocol. Pre-hybridization and hybridization of bound fragment(s) were carried out at 42°C for 1.5 hours and overnight, respectively. The blot was washed and processed further following the DIG High Prime DNA Labelling and Detection Starter Kit II protocol. The number of bands that appeared on the blot indicated the number of copies of the 540 bp cutinase probe, which also represented the number of copies of the cutinase genes in the genome. Wild type C. truncatum genomic DNA and pAA1 plasmid were used as controls.
Quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) analysis was conducted on the mycelium of 7-day-old F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F2, F4, F5, F7, and F8) that were inoculated onto the surface of 4-week-old young chili leaves of C. annuum genotype Bangchang, following a specified procedure. After 6 hours, the inoculated fungal mycelium was collected, freeze-dried, and subjected to RNA extraction and cDNA conversion. Wild type F8-3B served as the control. The transcript levels of CtCut1, which encodes the cutinase gene of C. truncatum, were quantified in the five transformants in response to gene knockdown. The reactions were performed with ABI qPCR universal master mix in an ABI-Applied Biosystems 7900 HT Thermal Cycler Real Time PCR machine. Triplicate qRT-PCR reactions were carried out for all biological replicates. Elongation Factor 1 (EF1) from wild type C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B was used as a reference gene for the qRT-PCR experiment due to its stability across diverse developmental stages. Analysis of the qRT-PCR data was performed using the comparative delta Ct (∆Ct) method. Two independent experiments were performed, each with three technical replicates. Results from the experiments were statistically analyzed using ANOVA.
Pathogenicity bioassays were conducted using the fruit of C. annuum genotype Bangchang, which is susceptible to C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B. Leaves of G. max genotype Bragg, another susceptible leguminous host of C. truncatum, were also used to verify the infection characteristics of the fungus. F8-3B-pAA1 transformants displaying a single copy gene T-DNA insertion in their genome were randomly selected for the pathogenicity assay. Detached fruits and leaves for pathogenicity assays were surface sterilized with 1.5% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes, followed by several rinses with sterile distilled water before fungal inoculation.
Preliminary non-wound chili fruit bioassays were carried out on detached C. annuum genotype Bangchang fruit. Agar plugs from 8-day-old cultures, consisting of actively growing mycelium of transformed strains (F1, F2, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, F10) and wild type, were excised and placed onto the surface sterilized fruit. The wild type F8-3B was used as the control and designated as FW. Subsequent pathogenicity bioassays utilized the wild type and two or three transformants.
F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F2, F4, and F8) were assessed by comparing inoculation methods (wound versus non-wound inoculation). For wound inoculation of detached chili fruit, the surface of the fruit was pricked with a sterile needle to a depth of 1 to 2 mm, allowing for the penetration of the cuticle. Agar plugs of actively growing mycelium from 14 to 21-day-old cultures of transformed strains and a wild type were then placed over the wound site. The fruits were positioned in a plastic box on a tray containing 900 ml of water, sealed to maintain humidity, and incubated at 28°C with a 12-hour photoperiod. Three fruit replicates were used for each treatment, and the experiment was replicated twice. Symptoms of typical anthracnose lesions were evaluated daily, and the disease severity on chili fruit caused by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and the wild type F8-3B was scored on a 0-9 rating scale according to the method by Montri et al. The anthracnose scores were recorded as soon as the first symptoms of the disease appeared on the fruit surface, occurring between 1 and 9 days after inoculation (DAI) for wound-inoculated fruit and between 1 and 13 DAI for non-wound inoculated fruit. The pathogenicity of the transformed strain was considered retained if the lesion score was similar to that of the wild type. A consensus rating score was assigned for each strain based on the predominant score from the three replicates. Ratings were based on comparisons to a set of key scale diagrams developed for this disease, with each rating representing a range of lesion sizes adjusted for fruit size.
Soybean is a highly susceptible host to C. truncatum, with inoculated leaves showing infection within 3 days. Therefore, soybean leaves of the G. max genotype Bragg were also used to assess the infection caused by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F1, F2, F4, F5, F7, F8, F9, and F10). Surface-sterilized detached leaves from 1-month-old soybean plants were placed on moist filter paper discs in Petri dishes. Agar plugs containing actively growing mycelium of F8-3B-pAA1 transformants were inoculated onto the left corner of the abaxial surface of the leaves, while the wild type F8-3B, designated as FW, was inoculated onto the right corner as a control. The inoculated leaves were incubated at 28°C with 95% relative humidity in a 12-hour photoperiod. Anthracnose symptoms, characterized by sunken and water-soaked tissue developing around the fungal plug on the leaves, were evaluated at 5 DAI. The disease severity caused by the transformed strains was measured based on the percentage of lesion diameter relative to the wild type. The pathogenicity of the transformants was deemed retained if the lesion diameter was similar to that of the wild type. The experiment was conducted with two leaves, each comprising two replicates of the transformants and the wild type. The experiment was repeated twice, and the results were statistically analyzed using ANOVA.
For screening germ tube and appressorium development, the sterilized abaxial surface of detached young leaves from the C. annuum genotype Bangchang was placed on moist filter paper discs in Petri dishes and inoculated with 10 μl of 2 × 10^6 conidiospores/ml of F8-3B-pAA1 transformants (F2, F4, F5, F7, and F8). At least two leaves were used per fungal sample, and three positions on the abaxial leaf surface (basal end, mid rib, and tip end) were inoculated. The wild type F8-3B was used as a control and designated as FW. The Petri dishes were sealed with parafilm and incubated
Two time points, 6 hours after inoculation (HAI) and 24 HAI, were selected to determine the appropriate time for counting germ tube and appressoria structures. Inoculated tissue samples were excised into 1 cm² leaf pieces and then placed in acetic alcohol solution (absolute ethanol: glacial acetic acid, 1:2) for 24 to 48 hours according to the method by Khan and Hsiang to remove the chlorophyll. The acetic alcohol solution containing the leaf tissues was replaced when it turned dark green. Cleared tissues were removed, rinsed with sterile distilled water, and placed on a glass slide with the abaxial surface facing up in drops of 0.05% trypan blue (w/v) before being examined under a Leica DMRBE microscope (Leica Microsystems, Germany). Images were captured using a Leica DC300F digital camera with Leica IM50 v.4 software. Each leaf tissue was considered a separate replicate, with three out of the six replicates randomly chosen per fungal sample. A total of 100 conidiospores per tissue were observed for conidiospore germination and appressoria formation. Conidiospores were considered germinated when germ tubes were present, regardless of germ tube length. The occurrence of a globular structure at the conidiospore or at the end of the germ tube, with a diameter larger than that of the germ tube, was considered an appressorium and counted. Results from the experiments were statistically analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA).
Expression analysis of the C. truncatum cutinase gene transcript on chili host revealed that the transcript was upregulated during C. truncatum infection. Similar RT-PCR results were obtained in all three independent biological replicates. A 1936-bp cutinase genomic DNA fragment from C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B was obtained and designated as CtCut1. The primer binding sites of the sequence were identified, and the predicted molecular weight for CtCut1 DNA was 1196.35 kDa. The nucleotide sequence contained segments identical to the partial gene obtained previously from RT-PCR results. Sequence analysis revealed an open reading frame (ORF) of 684 nucleotides with a stop codon (TGA), interrupted by a single 57-bp intron. The predicted ORF encoded a polypeptide of 228 amino acids with a predicted molecular weight of 23.81 kDa and a predicted protein isoelectric point (pI) of 7.82. The nucleotide and predicted amino acid sequences showed significant 99% identity to the cutinase of C. capsici isolated from papaya, and 85% and 84% identity to G. cingulata and C. gloeosporioides, respectively. Foll
All C. truncatum transformed strains were able to grow on the hygromycin selective medium. The phenotypes of the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and the wild type (FW) were indistinguishable with respect to colony morphology, growth rate, and conidiospore production. The unique feature of the fungus, characterized by the formation of concentric rings during sporulation, was exhibited in all individuals. The conidiospores and hyphae of the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and wild type samples did not fluoresce under the GFP filter, indicating that the silencing construct had been integrated into the genome and was functioning efficiently. Single-spore-derived F8-3B-pAA1 transformed strains were subjected to PCR
Comparative CtCut1 transcription of six hours post-inoculation (HAI) C. truncatum mycelium from five F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and one wild type was determined using qRT-PCR. Differential expression of CtCut1, which encodes for the cutinase gene in C. truncatum, was detected from these transformants at 6 HAI. In the wild type (FW) mycelium, the amount of CtCut1 transcript, when normalized to EF1 transcript, yielded a relative expression value of 2.45 ± 0.11 SE, compared with 1.33 ± 0.29 SE from the average of five transformants. These data indicated an almost one-fold decrease in the relative expression of CtCut1 in F8-3B pAA1 transformants during infection. The highest significant decrease occurred in transformant F2, followed by F5, F8, and F4, with decreases in CtCut1 transcript of 72.0%, 52.7%, 45.1%, and 44.3%, respectively, compared to the wild type. In contrast, transformant F7 displayed no significant difference from the wild type, although a slight reduction occurred in the CtCut1 transcript (14.9%). Overall, F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited 54.2% of cutinase activity compared to the wild type.
In a preliminary pathogenicity bioassay with non-wounded detached chili fruit, all F8-3B-pAA1 transformants generally showed reduced or no infection compared to the wild type at 13 days after inoculation (DAI). In a subsequent detailed pathogenicity assay on wounded and non-wounded fruit, the transformed strains were found to be less aggressive on non-wounded fruit compared to the wild type at both 9 and 13 DAI. Very little or no infection occurred in fruit up to 9 DAI for the transformed strains; however, by 13 DAI, symptoms of the disease were displayed at the site of the transformed inoculum, suggesting a delay in the transformants' ability to invade host tissues. On wounded fruit, there was no difference in the severity of infection between the wild type and transformed strains at 2 or 4 DAI.
Evidence of pAA1 cassette integration in several independent hygromycin-resistant C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B fungal genomes was obtained through PCR analysis of genomic DNA. Primers specific for amplifying an internal 544-bp fragment of the hph marker gene (top panel) and the 207 bp sgfp gene (lower panel) were used. The wild type, indicated as FW, served as a negative control, while the pAA1 plasmid served as a positive control. The 1 kb Plus DNA Ladder was utilized to visualize the PCR products. Southern analysis of the hygromycin-resistant transformants involved digesting genomic DNA (8 μg) with HindIII and probing with a DIG-labelled 540 bp cutinase sense fragment. The closed triangle indicates the single-copy endogenous cutinase gene, which hybridized at approximately 8.0 kb in the fungal genome. The open triangle represents the exogenous cutinase silencing transcriptional unit (2386 bp) within the T-DNA fragment. Non-transformed C. truncatum (FW) was used as a negative control, while HindIII+EcoRI-digested pAA1 plasmid served as a positive control. An arrow corresponds to the undigested plasmid.
GFP fluorescence was not detected in any conidiospores isolated from the infected fruits, neither from the wild type nor from the transformants.
Germinated conidia formed appressoria by 6 hours after inoculation (HAI) on the leaf of Capsicum annuum genotype Bangchang. At 6 HAI, the highest number of appressoria formation occurred in the wild type compared to the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants. However, no significant difference in germ tube length was found between the wild type and the transformants, except that the length of germ tubes with appressoria in the transformants was generally longer compared to the wild type.
In a soybean leaf bioassay, differences in infection severity were observed between the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants at 5 days
The role of cutinase and its impact on the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum truncatum has been extensively studied. The triad of Asp, Ser, and His, along with the essential carboxyl group within the cloned CtCut1, resembled cutinases from other fungi. RNA-mediated gene silencing in C. truncatum was successfully achieved through the development of a hairpin plasmid, pAA1, using a relatively short fragment of sGFP and CtCut1 as silencing targets. This led to variable but efficient knockdown of the cutinase gene. The pAA1 plasmid was stably transformed into C. truncatum via Agrobacterium tumefaciens-mediated transformation, with pAA1-dsRNA synthesized in vitro. The conidiospores and hyphae of F8-3B-pAA1 transformants did not fluoresce under the GFP filter, unlike the pJF1 transformants expressing GFP. This indicated the successful incorporation of the hairpin cassette into the fungal genome, activating the endogenous RNAi machinery within the pathogen.
Furthermore, the transformed strains were able to survive multiple rounds of subculture on selective media, suggesting stable integration. Southern analysis confirmed that the pAA1 cassette was integrated ectopically into the genome of all transformed strains. Notably, the pAA1 hairpin induced gene silencing of CtCut1 without significant off-target effects, regardless of the number of T-DNA copies harboring the pAA1 cassette in the genome. All transformed strains showed no significant changes in morphology, growth rate, or conidiospore production, indicating that only the CtCut1 gene was affected.
The pAA1 plasmid was versatile, containing restriction enzyme sites for creating hairpin cassettes for any gene of interest, as long as the primers used were designed with compatible sites. The success of the silencing was enhanced by the relatively short 57-bp intron sequence in the pAA1 plasmid, which has been reported to provide stable and high silencing frequencies in Magnaporthe oryzae, sometimes resulting in completely silenced phenotypes. Additionally, the intron sequence used to form the hairpin in the pAA1 plasmid, derived from the cutinase gene of C. truncatum, likely reduced the possibility of organism rejection.
Proper regulation of RNA-silencing machinery that enables high levels of gene silencing was anticipated. In contrast, the use of intron sequences from non-related organisms has been shown to yield lower gene silencing efficacy. Despite the limited genome information of C. truncatum and partial integration of T-DNA, the RNAi approach still produced silenced transformants to some degree, which is often sufficient for practical applications. The inactivation of the gene posed fewer challenges, such as the need to identify the number of copies or members of the gene in the genome. Moreover, RNA-mediated gene silencing could simultaneously silence homologous genes in C. truncatum, as CtCut1 gene suppression occurred in a sequence-specific and not locus-specific manner. This indicates that silencing the cutinase gene using this approach is straightforward, eliminating the need for tailored knockdowns for each gene member. Although further work is necessary to identify the presence of cutinase members in C. truncatum, Southern analysis revealed promising results.
C. truncatum had a single copy of the cutinase gene in its genome, which likely corresponds to the presence of one cutinase gene member in the pathogen. Reports indicate the divergence of cutinase in other Colletotrichum species genomes. In contrast, Skamnioti et al. reported the presence of multimembered cutinase families in Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium graminearum, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa. In this case, RNA-mediated gene silencing of cutinase in C. truncatum appeared to have simultaneously suppressed the entire gene family (homologous genes), thus avoiding gene compensation. Baulcombe demonstrated that co-suppression of gene families occurred during the disruption of the quelling defective (qde 1) gene mutation, resulting in the silencing of a tomato RNA-dependent RNA polymerase homologue in N. crassa. Simultaneous silencing of homologues was also observed in the silencing of the OsRac gene. Three members of the OsRac gene family in Oryza sativa were suppressed when inverted repeat sequences derived from highly conserved regions of the gene family were used. Not surprisingly, the RNA-mediated gene silencing approach has been adopted in many fungal gene manipulation studies. More importantly, the expression of the CtCut1 transcript in the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants was lower than in the wild type C. truncatum. A wide range of reduced mRNA levels of CtCut1 (14.9% to 72%) was observed among the transformed strains. Such variation among transformants using this technique has also been observed in other fungal pathogens, including Phanerochaete chrysosporium and Botrytis cinerea. As indicated earlier, these differences could have been due to the ectopic integration of T-DNA within the genome of the pathogen. Additionally, the genome complexity of different microorganisms and environmental changes may have contributed to the variability. Likewise, the infection and colonization by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants on detached chili and soybean hosts were inefficient compared to the wild type F8-3B, further suggesting the gene's involvement during pathogenesis. Transformed strains were unable to infect normally, and there was a delay in infection, as indicated by the extremely slow development of anthracnose symptoms on chili fruits. This suggests that direct penetration through the host cuticle during the infection process of C. truncatum was largely governed by the presence of cutinase in the fungus.
In contrast, there was no difference in infection and colonization by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and wild type on wounded fruit, suggesting that cutinase no longer played a significant role in cell infection after penetration of the cuticle. Hence, there was no disadvantage for the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants, which had reduced expression of cutinase, once they had infected the pericarp tissue. These results are consistent with previously reported work demonstrating that C. capsici pathotype F8-3B could infect chili fruits when wound inoculation was applied. If the hypothesis is that cutinase assists with the penetration of the fungal pathogen, then the wound inoculation method is unlikely to effectively demonstrate the function of the gene, as the host's first layer of defense (cuticle and epidermis) has already been disrupted. The reduced expression of cutinase in the transformants may have interfered with or delayed the pathogen's recognition of the host surface, leading to the formation of fewer appressoria. Cutinase may be necessary to stimulate a host reaction that the pathogen recognizes to initiate appressoria formation and penetration. Therefore, the pathogen's inability to express the effector (cutinase) may have resulted in lower infection rates. Deising et al. reported that cutinase was involved in the adhesion of Uromyces viciae uredospores to the host cuticle. In another study, Woloshuk and Kolattukudy indicated that cutinase expression from spores of F. solani was triggered upon contact with the plant cuticle. Li et al. also noted that low levels of cutinase in the saprophytic phase of F. pisi f. sp. pisi were essential for inducing higher levels of cutinase expression during infection. Since the endogenous cutinase in these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants was suppressed, the regulation of normal cutinase activity was affected. It remains unclear whether this abnormal regulation resulted from an inability to secrete sufficient levels of cutinase to induce cutin monomers from the host or from the pathogen's failure to detect the host cutin monomers. The soybean pathogenicity bioassay revealed different levels of infection in soybean leaves when inoculated with various selected F8-3B-pAA1 transformants. These observations confirmed that the disturbance of the CtCut1 gene via RNA-mediated gene silencing (knockdown) altered the pathogenicity of the transformants. The relative expression of the five selected F8-3B-pAA1 transformants showed varying levels of CtCut1 transcription compared to the control wild type in the qRT-PCR assay. Lower levels of CtCut1 transcripts corresponded to reduced infection. Similar findings were observed in the Pyrenopeziza brassicae-Brassica napus system, where mutants lacking cutinase transcript expression failed to penetrate the cuticle of Brassica napus cotyledons. Additionally, Lee et al. demonstrated that the pathogenicity of Monilinia fructicola on peach petals was more aggressive when the gene was overexpressed, indicating its involvement during infection. Collectively, these results demonstrated that the pAA1 plasmid was efficient and could be applied to various genes and Colletotrichum species for gene silencing. The findings suggest that the silencing of cutinase may have altered pathogenicity within the transformants. More durable and innovative forms of disease control can be practiced when knowledge of pathogenicity genes that trigger resistance is accessible through this alternative genetic tool approach.
