Chili (Capsicum spp.) is an important vegetable crop worldwide. China maintains the largest planted area of chili, producing more than 28 million tons per year for domestic consumption and export. One of the most destructive diseases restricting chili production is anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., resulting in up to 40% yield loss in China. Colletotrichum species can infect more than 30 plant genera. More than 10 Colletotrichum species have been reported from chili, with different distributions among countries. For example, anthracnose on chili is caused by C. coccodes, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. truncatum in India; by C. acutatum, C. coccodes, and C. gloeosporioides in the USA; by C. acutatum, C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. truncatum in Australia; by C. acutatum, C. coccodes, C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. panacicolain in Korea; and by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and C. coccodes in China. Most of these reports, however, were based on morphology and ITS sequences or a combination of ITS and TUB2 sequences, which have been shown to be insufficient in distinguishing closely related taxa in several species complexes. In addition, these records were mostly based on a small sampling from restricted areas, and thus may underestimate the species diversity. The current study aimed to investigate the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose on chili in China by employing large-scale sampling and isolation, and via morphological characterization and multi-locus phylogeny of the obtained strains.
From 2008 to 2014, fruits and leaves of chili (Capsicum spp.) with anthracnose symptoms were collected from 50 locations in 29 provinces of China. In each location, a hierarchical sampling method was used. Five fields were chosen at each sampling location, and 25 chili fruits, along with leaves in some cases, were collected from each field along a diagonal transect. Colletotrichum species were isolated as previously described. All isolates were grown at 28 °C for further study. Type specimens of new species from this study were deposited in the Mycological Herbarium, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China, and ex-type living cultures were deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Centre, Beijing, China.
Mycelial plugs (5 mm) were transferred from the edge of actively growing cultures to fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA, 1.5%) plates. Cultures were kept at 28 °C with a 12/12 h fluorescent light/dark cycle. The morphological characters for all isolates, including colony and conidial characteristics, were observed. Microscopic characters were examined with the Carl Zeiss Imager A2 microscope after 1 month of cultivation. Among the 1,285 obtained isolates, 121 representative isolates were selected for further multilocus phylogenetic analyses based on geographical location, morphology (colony shape and color and characteristics of aerial mycelia and conidia), and Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of chili in China.
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is a serious disease affecting more than 30 plant genera. Several Colletotrichum species have been reported to infect chili in different countries. Although China is the largest chili-producing country, little is known about the species infecting chili locally. Therefore, we collected samples of diseased chili from 29 provinces of China, from which 1,285 strains were isolated. The morphological characters of all strains were observed and compared, and multilocus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and HIS3) were performed on selected representative strains. Fifteen Colletotrichum species were identified, with C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum being prevalent. Three new species, C. conoides, C. grossum, and C. liaoningense, were recognized and described in this paper. Colletotrichum aenigma, C. cliviae, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, C. incanum, C. karstii, and C. viniferum were reported for the first time from chili. Pathogenicity of all species isolated from chili was confirmed, except for C. endophytica. The current study improves the understanding of species causing anthracnose on chili and provides useful information for the effective control of the disease in China.
Different morphological types were selected from each location, and the number of representative isolates selected depended on the number of isolates with different morphologies. Furthermore, if the number of isolates with high morphological and ITS sequence similarities was less than 10 in one location, then one isolate was randomly selected as a representative. If the number was more than 10, then an additional isolate (one from each of the 10 isolates) was selected for multilocus phylogenetic analyses. The length and width of 30 conidia for each isolate were measured in lactic acid, and mean values were calculated. The formation of appressoria was induced as described by Cai et al. (2009). Genomic DNA was extracted from 121 representative isolates as previously described. The following loci were amplified with the indicated primers: the internal transcribed spacer regions and intervening 5.8S nrRNA gene (ITS) with primers ITS4/ITS5; partial sequences of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate
ACT783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999); beta-tubulin (TUB2) with primers T1/Bt2b (Glass & Donaldson 1995, O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997); calmodulin (CAL) with primers CL1/CL2A (O’Donnell et al. 2000); chitin synthase 1 (CHS­1) with primers CHS-79F/CHS-345R (Carbone & Kohn 1999); and histone3 (HIS3) with primers CYLH3F/CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b). PCR reactions were performed as described by Damm et al. (2009). DNA sequencing was conducted by Sunbiotech, Beijing, China, with a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The sequences obtained from forward and reverse primers were used to obtain consensus sequences with DNAMAN v. 6.0 (Lynnon Biosoft, USA). Sequences were aligned using MAFFT v. 6 (Katoh & Toh 2010).
Phylogenetic analysis: All sequences of the 121 representative isolates were blasted in GenBank. Sequences with high similarities were selected and included in the analyses. Concatenated analyses of ITS, GAPDH, CHS­1, HIS3, ACT, and TUB2 were conducted for the C. acutatum species complex and Colletotrichum species with curved conidia, while ITS, GAPDH, CAL, ACT, CHS­1, and TUB2 were concatenated for the analysis of the C. gloeosporioides species complex and other species. Maximum parsimony (MP) analyses based on the combined datasets were conducted using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2002). Phylogenetic trees were generated using the heuristic search option with TBR branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were unlimited, with branches of zero length collapsed, and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Clade stability was assessed using a bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates. Afterward, tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated. Bayesian inference (BI) was used to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). Best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were selected using MrModelTest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004). Two analyses of four MCMC chains were run from random trees for 1,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100 generations, resulting in 20,000 total trees. The first 25% of the trees were discarded as the burn-in phase of each analysis, and the remaining trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities. An additional Maximum likelihood (ML) analysis was implemented in the C. gloeosporioides species complex using the CIPRES Science Gateway, and the RAxML-HPC BlackBox was selected with default parameters. Sequences derived in this study were deposited in GenBank, and the concatenated alignments were deposited in TreeBASE.

Species collected include:
C. fructicola was collected from various locations in China, predominantly from fruits. In Fuzhou, Fujian, samples were collected in 2011 with an incidence of 26.07 and coordinates 119.29. Other notable locations include Guilin, Guangxi, where samples were taken in October 2011 with an incidence of 25.27 at coordinates 110.29, and Hengyang, Hunan, with samples from April 2012 showing an incidence of 29.03 at 111.69. Additional collections were made in Changsha, Hunan, and Laiyang, Shandong, with incidences of 28.23 and 36.99, respectively. The dataset also includes collections from Wucheng, Shandong, Zhangzhou, Fujian, Quanzhou, Fujian, and various other regions across China.
C. gloeosporioides was identified in Guilin, Guangxi, in January 2011, with an incidence of 25.27 at 110.29. Other collections were made in Qingyuan, Guangdong, across different years, showcasing similar incidences. Laiyang, Shandong, and Wucheng, Shandong, were also notable locations for this species.
C. grossum and C. hymenocallidis were reported in Haikou, Hainan, and Changsha, Hunan, respectively, with incidences of 20.04 and 28.23. C. incanum was collected in Helingeer, Inner Mongolia, with an incidence of 40.37 at coordinates 111.82. C. karstii samples were found in Sanya, Hainan, and Jianyang, Sichuan, with incidences of 18.25 and 30.41.
C. liaoningense was collected from Xingcheng, Liaoning, with an incidence of 40.63. The species C. scovillei was reported from Yanqing and Changping in Beijing. Other regions like Gangu, Gansu, and Jida, Jilin, also contributed to the findings.
C. truncatum was noted in Qingyuan, Guangdong, with collections spanning multiple years, indicating a consistent presence in that region. The data suggests a significant presence of various Colletotrichum species across diverse locations in China, particularly in fruit samples.
A genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition analysis was performed on new species and their closest relatives, employing the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) model along with a pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test to assess recombination levels within closely related species. The analysis utilized a six-locus concatenated dataset, and a PHI index below 0.05 indicated significant recombination. The relationships among closely related species were visualized by constructing a split graph.
Seven chili cultivars, Capsicum annuum cv. Chaotianjiao, Den glongjiao, Sanyingjiao, Zidantou, C. frutescens cv. Shuangla, Xiaomila, and C. chinense cv. Huangdijiao, were inoculated with representative strains of 15 Colletotrichum species, respectively. Pathogenicity tests were conducted on chili following the methods described by Montri et al. (2009) and Mongkolporn et al. (2010). Healthy, ripe red and green chili fruits were surface sterilized in 1% NaClO for 5 minutes separately, washed twice with sterile distilled water, and air-dried on sterile filter paper. Each fruit was inoculated with 1 μL of a conidial suspension (1 × 10^6 conidial/mL), which was injected onto the non-wounded fruit surface using a microsyringe. Control fruits were treated with 1 μL of distilled water. Each isolate was inoculated to five replicate fruits. The inoculated fruits were incubated in a moist chamber at 28 °C and were examined for symptoms daily for 9 days. The virulence and pathotypes were evaluated as described by Montri et al. (2009). The experiment was conducted twice.
RESULTS
Disease survey and strain isolation: Symptoms of anthracnose were circular or angular sunken lesions on chili fruits and irregularly shaped brown spots with dark brown edges on leaves. A total of 1,285 isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from 29 provinces in China. Attempts were made to collect samples from multiple locations in Tibet and Xinjiang provinces for several years but failed to locate symptomatic plants. All strains were isolated from fruits except those from Jiangxi province, where serious damage was found on chili leaves rather than on fruits.
Group assessment: Based on megablast searches in GenBank using ITS sequences and the colony morphologies on PDA, all strains were assigned to four groups: those that produce cylindrical conidia with round ends were assigned to the C. gloeosporioides species complex; those that produce acute ends or ± cylindrical conidia with only one acute end were assigned to the C. acutatum species complex; those that produce dark setae and curved conidia were assigned to the Colletotrichum species with curved conidia; and the remaining strains were assigned to a fourth group. Among the 121 isolates, 31 belonged to the C. gloeosporioides complex; 48 belonged to the C. acutatum complex; 34 belonged to the Colletotrichum species with curved conidia; and eight belonged to the fourth group.
Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses: The 121 representative isolates from chili were subjected to multi-locus phylogenetic analyses. The trees generated from the Bayesian and RaxML analyses were essentially similar to that from the MP analysis and are therefore not shown. In the analysis, the 31 isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex clustered in eight clades: eight with C. fructicola, 13 with C. gloeosporioides, and four with C. aenigma, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, and C. viniferum, respectively. In addition, two distinct lineages, which clustered distantly from any known species in the complex, were recognized as new species and herein described as C. conoides and C. grossum.

Te traga stris panamensis is a species found in Panama. Various strains of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and other species were analyzed for their phylogenetic relationships, detailing host, location, and GenBank accession numbers.
The analysis included multiple strains of Capsicum spp. from China. For example, strains labeled CA UG 2 through CA UG 29 provided accession numbers, indicating their origins and relationships. Additionally, Citrus sinensis and various Vanda spp. from Thailand were included in the analysis.
The table described includes the strains used for the phylogenetic analysis of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, providing details about each strain's host, geographical location, and GenBank accession numbers. This information is crucial for understanding the diversity and distribution of these fungi in different environments.
Strains used for the phylogenetic analysis of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex with details about host, location, and GenBank accession numbers include the following:
Capsicum annuum and Capsicum frutescens cultivars were susceptible to all tested Colletotrichum species (except C. endophytica), with disease scores ranging from 5 to 9. Capsicum chinense was susceptible to most of the Colletotrichum species, except C. cliviae CAUOS5, C. endophytica CAUG28, and C. hymenocallidis CAUG9. Capsicum annuum and Capsicum frutescens were the most susceptible, with average scores of 7. Three pathotypes (PC1-R, PC2-R, and PC3-R) were identified based on three differential reactions of tested strains with Capsicum chinense cv. Huangdijiao, Capsicum annuum, and Capsicum frutescens. Host reactions of the mature green fruit were similar to those of the ripe fruit. Similar to the ripe fruit, all three cultivars of the mature green fruit of Capsicum annuum, Zidantou, Denglongjiao, and Sanyingjiao, were susceptible to all tested Colletotrichum species, except C. endophytica, with average scores ranging from 5 to 6. Most of the Capsicum frutescens cultivars and Capsicum chinense cv. Huangdijiao at the green fruit stage were susceptible to most isolates, except C. aenigma CAUG26, C. conoides CAUG17, C. gloeosporioides CAUG2, C. grossum CAUG7, C. fructicola CAUG1, and C. karstii CAUOS1. Five pathotypes were identified based on the differential reactions with Xiaomila, Shuangla, and Huangdijiao. All of the pathogenic isolates formed sunken, brown to dark lesions on the fruits. No symptoms developed on the negative controls.
To determine the prevalence of Colletotrichum species associated with chili in China, the sample locations and the number of isolates were assessed for each species. Isolates with highly similar morphology and ITS sequences to those of the ex-type of C. truncatum appear to be the most common (N = 422), representing 33% of all isolates and present in 56% of all sampling locations. All 34 isolates chosen from this group for multi-locus phylogenetic analysis were confirmed to be C. truncatum. Therefore, it appears that C. truncatum is the most prevalent species of Colletotrichum on chili in China. The next most prevalent species included C. scovillei, C. gloeosporioides, C. fioriniae, and C. fructicola, which accounted for 21%, 14%, 14%, and 13% of all the isolates, respectively. The remaining species were detected in less than 3% of the sampling locations.
Based on the morphology and the multi-locus phylogeny, the 121 isolates were assigned to 15 species. Seven species (C. aenigma, C. cliviae, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, C. incarnum, C. karstii, and C. viniferum) were reported from chili for the first time. Three other species (C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, and C. scovillei) were reported for the first time in China, and a further three species were newly described. Colle

Specimen examined: China, Jiangsu Province, Nanjing City, on fruits of Capsicum annuum var. conoides, September 2010, Y.Z. Diao (holotype HMAS 246481, ex-type living culture CGMCC 3.17615 = CAUG17 = LC6226); also, NJ26, living culture CAUG33; NJ27, living culture CAUG34. Notes — Colletotrichum conoides is phylogenetically most closely related to C. hebeiense. Sequence data from ITS and CHS-1 could not separate the two species, but they can be distinguished by GAPDH (12 bp), ACT (4 bp), or TUB (3 bp). The two species also differ in the following characteristics: the granules are uniformly distributed in the conidia of C. conoides, while they are mostly present at the polar ends in the conidia of C. hebeiense. Most appressoria of C. conoides are ovoid ellipsoidal with crenate or deeply lobed margins, while those of C. hebeiense are clavate to subglobose. The conidia of C. conoides are slightly larger than those of C. hebeiense (13–17.5 × 5–6.5 µm vs. 11.6–15.3 × 4.47–6.88 µm). Additionally, C. conoides was described from Capsicum annuum var. conoides, whereas C. hebeiense was described from Vitis vinifera. A PHI test revealed no significant recombination event between C. conoides and C. hebeiense.

Colletotrichum conoides (CAUG17) is illustrated with colonies on PDA shown from above and below, conidiophores, appressoria, and conidia. Scale bars indicate 10 μm for the figures.
Colletotrichum liaoningense Y.Z. Diao, C. Zhang, L. Cai & X.L. Liu, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB812007; Etymology refers to the province in China where the fungus was first collected. Colonies on PDA reached 48–51 mm in diameter in 4 days at 28 °C, with aerial mycelia appearing light grey and the reverse medium to dark brown with a white margin. Chlamydospores were not observed. Vegetative hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiomata are acervular. Setae are medium grey, smooth-walled to verruculose, 3–6-septate, measuring 46–68 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated base, and a tip that is rounded. Conidiophores are formed directly on aerial mycelium, hyaline, and aseptate. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, cylindrical to clavate, measuring 27–30 × 3.5–4.5 µm, with openings of 2–4 µm. Conidia are cylindrical to clavate, with rounded ends or one end acute, containing granules mostly at the polar ends, hyaline, aseptate, smooth-walled, measuring 14–18.5 μm × 5–7.5 µm (average = 16.3 × 6.1 µm), with an L/W ratio of 2.7. Appressoria are single, medium to dark brown, aseptate, mostly ellipsoidal to irregular in outline, and crenate at the margin, measuring 3.5–5 × 2.5–4.5 µm (average = 4.1 × 2.9 µm), with an L/W ratio of 1.4. The sexual morph was not observed after 8 weeks.
Specimens examined: China, Xingcheng City, Liaoning Province, on chili fruits (Capsicum annuum var. conoides), Oct. 2012, Y.Z. Diao (holotype HMAS 246479, ex-type living culture CGMCC3.17616 = CAUOS2 = LC6228); other living cultures were noted as CAUOS3, CAUOS4, and CAUOS6.
Colletotrichum liaoningense is phylogenetically most closely related to C. brevisporum. The sequence data from ITS and ACT could not separate the two species; however, they can be distinguished via GAPDH (10 bp) or TUB (12 bp). The granules in the conidia of C. liaoningense are evenly distributed, while in C. brevisporum, they are mostly present at the polar ends. Additionally, the appressoria of C. liaoningense are smaller than those of C. brevisporum (3.5–5 × 2.5–4
C. gloeosporioides s.str. and C. fructicola were revealed to be the most prevalent in this complex, representing 47% and 42% of the isolates, respectively. Colletotrichum fructicola was originally isolated from coffee berries and has since been found on a wide range of host plants. However, this is the first report of C. fructicola infecting chili. In previous studies, C. gloeosporioides s.str. was shown to be an uncommon pathogen on chili and other fruits in the tropics. Additionally, we failed to isolate C. gloeosporioides s.str. from chili in the tropical regions of China, such as Hainan, southern Guangdong, and Yunnan provinces, suggesting a significant effect of climate on the distribution of these pathogens. The pathogenicity of all obtained species from chili in this study was confirmed by inoculation tests, except for that of C. endophytica. Colletotrichum endophytica, originally reported as an endophytic fungus in tropical grasses, did not show pathogenicity to any chili cultivars in our test, further underlining the possible endophytic nature of this species. Colletotrichum acutatum is a commonly reported species that causes anthracnose on numerous plants worldwide. It was originally described from Carica papaya, Capsicum frutescens, and Delphinium ajacis in Australia but has subsequently been reported to infect chili in almost all pepper-growing countries, such as Australia, China, India, Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, and the USA. Like C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum has also been shown to represent a species complex. Interestingly, C. acutatum s.str. was not found on chili in China. Only C. scovillei and C. fioriniae were identified from this complex. No Colletotrichum species were detected on chili in Tibet and Xinjiang, despite several field trips made to these provinces and attempts to isolate these fungi. The failure to detect Colletotrichum species from these regions might be explained by the high latitude, small growing area, dry climate, and high day/night temperature variation. Colletotrichum fructicola and C. truncatum were isolated from leaves in Jiangxi province and were also found in fruits in other sampling regions. In previous studies, these two species were primarily isolated from fruits of various plants. In summary, the current study represents the most intensive investigation of Colletotrichum species on chili in China, revealing 15 species, with the dominant species being C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum. The information provided here could prove useful for the control of anthracnose on chili, as well as for the screening of new chili cultivars against anthracnose.
