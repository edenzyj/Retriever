First Report of Anthracnose Crown Rot of Strawberry Caused by Colletotrichum siamense in Taiwan
This article, published in Plant Disease in March 2019, presents the first documented case of anthracnose crown rot in strawberries, attributed to the pathogen Colletotrichum siamense in Taiwan. The study was conducted by five authors, including Hiran A. Ariyawansa and Chia-Lin Chung from National Taiwan University, who have collectively contributed significantly to the field with numerous publications and citations. The findings highlight the emergence of this disease in the region, which poses a threat to strawberry cultivation. The article has garnered attention, indicated by its citations and readership statistics, reflecting the importance of monitoring and managing plant diseases in agricultural practices.
First Report of Anthracnose Crown Rot of Strawberry Caused by Colletotrichum siamense in Taiwan

In Taiwan, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) is a high-value crop with an average annual cultivated area of approximately 500 ha over the last five years. More than 90% of strawberry cultivation occurs in Miaoli County, with ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ as the predominant cultivar for over 30 years. Anthracnose has become increasingly destructive over the past decade. Although Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum have been identified as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, there is limited information on the isolation, pathogenicity, and morphological or molecular identification of the pathogen.
From 2010 to 2016, we surveyed anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited typical anthracnose crown rot (ACR) symptoms. ACR caused plant losses of 30 to 40% during the seedling stage and approximately 20% after transplanting. Infected crown tissue initially displayed red and white marbling, which gradually progressed to brown rot, followed by rapid wilting of the entire plant. Anthracnose symptoms were also observed in other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. Symptoms appeared as circular black spots on the leaves and withering and girdling on runners.
To isolate the causal agent, approximately 0.2 × 0.2-cm fragments of diseased crowns were surface-disinfested with 1% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with sterile water, and placed onto 1.5% water agar. After 2 to 3 days, extended single hyphal tips from tissues were transferred to potato dextrose agar and incubated for 7 days at 25°C under a 12-h light/dark photoperiod. The colonies were initially white, later developing a somewhat zonate, velvety appearance that was light gray on the upper side and gray on the reverse side of the plates, with concentric rings of salmon sporodochia. The conidia measured 9.68 to 17.95 × 3.88 to 5.84 µm (14.53 ± 0.31 × 4.99 ± 0.08 µm, n = 90), were hyaline, oblong to cylindrical, with rounded obtuse ends. The morphological characteristics of the causal agent resembled species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. To confirm species identification, genomic DNA was extracted.

From 10 isolates, genomic DNA was extracted using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), β-tubulin 2 (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region of Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT) were PCR-amplified with published primers. Sequences were submitted to GenBank with accession numbers MK174223 (ITS), MK174224 (CHS-1), MK174225 (ACT), MK174226 (TUB2), MK174227 (CAL), and MK174228 (ApMAT). The ITS, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT sequences were compared to the GenBank nr database, restricted to type material. Results showed 98 to 99% identity to C. siamense (syn. C. dianesei and C. melanocaulon), which belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled for two isolates (ML133 and ML612) by spraying a conidial suspension on seedlings at the 4 to 5 leaf stage. Inoculated plants were covered with plastic bags to maintain high humidity for 24 hours at 30°C, then kept in a growth chamber at the same temperature and humidity under a 12-hour photoperiod. After 7 days, all inoculated plants exhibited typical necrotic leaf spots and wilt symptoms similar to those observed in the field, while control plants showed no symptoms. Longitudinal sections of the inoculated crown displayed reddish-brown and white marbled necrosis. The fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased leaves or crowns with 100% frequency, and morphological characteristics and gene sequences were identical to the original isolates. This is the first report of C. siamense causing ACR of strawberry in Taiwan. The disease poses a significant threat to the strawberry industry in Taiwan, necessitating research on management strategies to minimize losses.
