Sodium Chloride, Nitrogen Source, and Lime Influence Fusarium Crown Rot Severity in Tomato
Applications of sodium applications were made during the early greenhouse forcing period using subirrigation. Blueing florists’ hydrangeas required approximately 12 g of sodium or 1.1 g of aluminum per pot. Overhead irrigation systems would normally require higher doses, specifically over 20 g of sodium per 1.6-liter pot due to leaching. These results provide field producers with more flexibility in determining the number of plants to be treated with sodium. Greenhouse forcers must apply sodium at the early stages of growth to allow for uptake and redistribution of aluminum within the plant.

Abstract
Media and nutrient variables were investigated to develop methods of reducing the incidence and severity of fusarium crown rot incited by Fusarium oxysporum Schlecht. f. sp. radicis-lycopersici Jarvis & Shoemaker (FORL), a disease problem of current importance with tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.). Root-dip inoculated seedlings were transplanted into trays of a medium consisting of 1 part Canadian peat to 1 part vermiculite that had been prepared with factorial combinations of CaCO3 (0.75 or 3.0 kg·m^-3), Ca(NO3)2 or (NH4)2SO4 (each at 225 mg N/liter), and NaCl at 0 or 2000 mg Na/liter as the experimental treatments. Crown rot was more severe with the lower CaCO3 rate, with (NH4)2SO4, and supplemental NaCl. Data on the fresh weight of seedlings, expressed as percentage values relative to the noninoculated controls, supported observations on disease severity. Fusarium crown rot of tomato incited by Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) has been a serious problem in the field in Florida (Jones et al., 1990) and in greenhouses and fields elsewhere (Bramall and McKeown, 1989; Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980; V
HORTSCIENCE, VOL. 27(10), OCTOBER 1992 hypocotyls of seedlings. Some crown rot isolates may strongly attack the roots, while others are only weak pathogens of roots. Crown rot has also been referred to as foot and root rot (Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980). The seedling culture medium selected for this research was intentionally very acidic (pH 4.0 to 5.7). Our results from previous work (Jones et al., 1990) show that an acidic reaction is essential for the rapid expression of the disease. Additionally, field experience associates low soil pH with higher levels of severity and incidence of the disease incited by FORL. Florida pine-palmetto flatwood soils have an initial pH that is very acidic (≈3.8), and the usual liming procedure does not adjust the pH upward quickly and uniformly. Sampling indicates that acid and moderately pH-elevated regions are present in the soil. Spot samples tested, in addition to the customary samples, show that both limed and unlimed conditions persist in the soil for some time after liming. Thus, an individual tomato plant will have some roots in strongly acidic zones while others will be surrounded by regions of moderately elevated pH. Although plant growth is satisfactory, nonuniform liming does not control Fusarium diseases. Normal sampling procedures do not reveal the range of pH values that exist nor the relative proportion of the volume that is effectively limed. Conducting research optimally necessitates quick and uniform production of the disease at will, which is aided by the use of an acidic medium. The lack of horticulturally acceptable cultivars with resistance to FORL accentuates the problem. Sodium chloride was selected as a variable because commercial tomato growers and workers in agricultural fields reported that high soil NaCl was frequently associated with the development of more severe and extensive outbreaks of crown rot. Additionally, Davet et al. (1966) reported that Fusarium wilt of tomato is aggravated by high NaCl content of irrigation water. Undesirably elevated soil NaCl levels are occasionally encountered by tomato growers in the United States. Since earlier research led to a system of control or reduction in the tomato Fusarium wilt disease (Davet et al., 1966; Woltz and Jones, 1968, 1973, 1981), we have attempted to apply and extend the findings with wilt to crown rot (Jones et al., 1990), since the two Fusaria are of the same species. Two-week-old seedlings of ‘Walter’ tomato were root-dip-inoculated in FORL inoculum prepared by blending potato glucose agar cultures in sterile deionized water and diluting to a final concentration of 5 × 10^6 spores per milliliter. The root dip also involved crowns and a portion of the hypocotyl. The inoculated seedlings, 15 per container, were transplanted into 18.5 × 24.5 × 2.5-cm plastic trays containing approximately 2 × 10^-3 m^3 of a 1 Canadian peat : 1 vermiculite mix. The medium was amended with 1.5 kg of Perk micronutrient mix (Vigoro Industries, Fairview Heights, Ill.) and 3.0 kg of single superphosphate per c
The experiment was performed in the greenhouse in November and December 1990, using a completely randomized-block design. Daytime temperatures ranged from 18 to 26°C, while night temperatures were between 17 and 21°C. Lower temperatures of 22 to 24°C are essential for the rapid and uniform development of crown rot (Jones et al., 1990). Statistical analysis was conducted using analysis of variance t-tests (LSD), comparing equal cell sizes with pairwise t-tests (SAS Institute, 1985).
Crown rot developed rapidly, initially manifesting as a breaking over of the hypocotyl, followed by wilting and necrosis of the leaves, ultimately leading to seedling death. In young and small seedlings (10 to 14 days), the expression was primarily a collapse of the hypocotyls. Older seedlings (14 to 28 days) exhibited girdling of the crown, rated according to the severity of the effect. Higher rates of calcium carbonate inhibited crown rot development, as evidenced by disease ratings and data for the fresh weight of inoculated seedlings expressed as percentages of the corresponding non-inoculated control plants. As a nitrogen source, calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) reduced crown rot severity compared to ammonium sulfate ((NH4)2SO4). Additionally, supplemental sodium chloride (NaCl) increased disease severity compared to the absence of extra NaCl. The combination of low calcium carbonate, (NH4)2SO4 as the nitrogen source, and added NaCl resulted in the most severe disease expression. A very low medium pH (approximately 4.0) was associated with increased disease severity. High sodium and low calcium contents of a 1 part medium to 2 parts water extract correlated with higher disease severity. Dipping roots in comminuted potato glucose agar culture suspensions at high inoculum levels was expected to overwhelm very young seedlings subjected to root wounding during handling, inoculation, and replanting. Surprisingly, certain combinations of calcium carbonate, nitrogen source, and sodium chloride provided a high degree of protection against crown rot disease. The data regarding nitrogen sources do not separate the effects of nitrate from ammonium but include the effects of calcium and sulfate. The effectiveness of fertilization practices in preventing diseases would likely be much greater under normal conditions of low inoculum potential without intentional wounding of roots, crowns, and hypocotyls, though confirmation requires application to commercial practices.
