ABSTRACT
Denoyes-Rothan, B., Guérin, G., Délye, C., Smith, B., Minz, D., Maymon, M., and Freeman, S. 2003. Genetic diversity and pathogenic variability among isolates of Colletotrichum species from strawberry. Phytopathology 93:219-228.
Ninety-five isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberry) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberry), were characterized by various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 sequence data provided clear genetic evidence of two subgroups in C. acutatum. The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberry and exhibited identical RAPD patterns and nearly identical ITS2 sequence analysis. A larger genetic group, CA variable, included isolates from various hosts and exhibited variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analysis. Within the C. acutatum population isolated from strawberry, the CA-clonal group is prevalent in Europe (54 isolates of 62). A subset of European C. acutatum isolates from strawberry, representing the CA-clonal and CA-variable groups, was assigned to two pathogenicity groups. No correlation could be drawn between genetic and pathogenicity groups. Based on molecular data, it is proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contains closely related, highly virulent C.
Colletotrichum spp. are currently identified using morpho-taxonomic criteria such as morphological characters, including conidial shape and size, appressorium morphology and size, setae morphology, and temperature response on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium. Recently, a variety of molecular approaches have been used to discriminate various Colletotrichum spp. or to study the genetic diversity within Colletotrichum spp. Some of these studies have focused on Colletotrichum spp. isolated from strawberry, distinguishing the three species pathogenic to strawberry. Although important progress has been made in identifying Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberry, genetic diversity within these species has been investigated to a lesser extent. Moreover, no correlation between genetic polymorphism and the two groups of pathogenicity has been studied. The purpose of this work was (i) to investigate genetic polymorphism and pathogenicity of C. acutatum, the major pathogen isolated from strawberry in Europe, and (ii) to determine the genetic relatedness of this pathogen to representative isolates of C. acutatum obtained from strawberry and other hosts from various countries worldwide. Additionally, isolates of C. gloeosporioides, observed occasionally on strawberry in Europe, were included in this work.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Fungal isolates. The 62 isolates of C. acutatum isolated from strawberry were chosen from various collections representing a range of isolation dates (1978 to 1998) and geographic regions worldwide. Nineteen C. acutatum isolates from other host plants were included in the study for comparison. Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting a pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic. In addition, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry originating from Europe and the United States, and one isolate from mango used as an outgroup, were studied. All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4°C. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests. All isolates were identified using classical taxonomic criteria such as conidial shape and growth on PDA.
Isolation of genomic DNA. Fungal mycelium was produced in 200 ml of liquid medium (24 g/liter of potato dextrose broth, 1 g/liter of yeast extract, and 1 g/liter of casein hydrolysate). Cultures were shaken at 100 rpm for 5 days at 27°C. Mycelium was harvested by filtration through mesh sieves, washed with sterile water, and deposited onto Whatman paper to remove excess water. Mycelium was ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen using a mortar and pestle and stored at –80°C. Three grams of mycelium powder was transferred to a 50-ml tube, and DNA was extracted using a method adapted from Saghai-Maroof by the addition of two chloroform/octanol phases and the addition of RNase A. DNA concentration was assessed using spectrometric measurement.
PCR amplification. All 95 Colletotrichum isolates were analyzed using random amplified polymorphic DNA polymerase chain reaction (RAPD-PCR). Amplifications were carried out in 15-µl reaction mixtures containing 30 ng of genomic DNA, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl (pH 8.6), 200 µM each of dATP, dTTP, dCTP, and dGTP, 0.2 µM ten-base primers, 0.2 mg/ml bovine serum albumin, 0.05% (wt/vol) polyoxyethylene-ether W1, and 0.7 units of Taq DNA polymerase. A Perkin-Elmer Cetus DNA thermal cycler was used with the following program: 1 min denaturation at 95°C, 45 cycles of 10 s at 95°C, 15 s at 37°C, and 2 min at 72°C, followed by a final extension step of 5 min at 72°C. Twenty RAPD primers were tested on six isolates (three strawberry isolates per species of Colletotrichum). Four primers (OPA13, OPB07, OPO02, and OPQ16) that revealed clear and polymorphic patterns were selected for further RAPD analysis. All RAPD-PCR were performed twice. Universal PCR primers (ITS1 and ITS4) were used.
The origin of the 95 analyzed single spore isolates of Colletotrichum spp. included various geographic locations and host plant species, predominantly strawberry. The isolates were collected from France, Germany, Italy, Spain, Switzerland, and the United States, spanning dates from 1984 to 1996. The color on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for most isolates was orange, and they were classified into either CA-clonal or CA-variable genetic groups based on RAPD results. Notable isolates included multiple entries from France and the United States, with specific identifiers indicating their unique collection details.

Vol. 93, No. 2, 2003 221 GATATGC were used for amplification of the ITS1 and ITS2 regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA, including the 5.8S rDNA from representative isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, which were selected according to RAPD analysis (one isolate per subgroup). For rDNA amplification, denaturation for 5 minutes at 95°C was followed by 40 cycles consisting of 30 seconds at 95°C, 30 seconds at 50°C, and 1.5 minutes at 72°C. The amplification products were analyzed by electrophoresis on 1.5% agarose gels stained with ethidium bromide and viewed under UV light. All ITS-PCR experiments were repeated at least four times with consistent results being achieved.
The ITS2 sequencing procedure involved PCR-amplified rDNA products using the primer pair ITS1 and ITS4, which resulted in a product of approximately 560 bp. This product was extracted from agarose gels using the Jetsorb kit. The Big Dye Terminator DNA sequencing kit was used for determining the sequence of the ITS2 regions. The sequence was determined using an ABI prism 377 DNA sequencer and was performed at the Molecular Biology Center, Rehovot, Israel.
Pathogenicity tests were conducted on a subset of 38 European isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, selected according to RAPD analysis, plus the isolate Goff from the United States. To assign C. acutatum isolates to pathogenicity groups 1 or 2, two strawberry cultivars (Belrubi and Elsanta) were chosen as differential hosts. Cv. Belrubi is resistant to pathogenicity group 2 isolates and sensitive to pathogenicity group 1 isolates. Cv. Elsanta is susceptible to isolates in both pathogenicity groups and exhibits different severity of symptoms depending on the aggressiveness of isolates. Three 6-week-old plants originating from micropropagation were inoculated with each isolate by spraying a conidial suspension adjusted to 2 × 10^6 conidia per ml, as previously described in a controlled environment chamber (27 ± 2°C, 90 to 95% relative humidity, and 14-h light). Disease response was recorded 4 weeks after inoculation and based on a 0 to 5 disease severity scale, where 0 = no symptoms and 5 = dead plant.
The data from the isolates included their geographic origin, host plant species, date of isolation, and their color on potato dextro
Phylogenetic analysis of sequence data. Analyses of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences were carried out using the program package ARB. Sequence alignment was performed with the ARB automated alignment tool, and the alignments were further refined manually. Phylogenetic analyses were performed using ARB's parsimony, distance matrix, and maximum likelihood methods. The branching order was similar across all methods used. To assess the robustness of the phylogenetic trees, analyses were performed on the original data set as well as a data set from which highly variable positions were removed using a 50% conservation filter for the members of Colletotrichum. This filter was applied to reduce potential tree artifacts that could result from multiple base changes. All sequences used in this study were aligned according to 155 bases in the ITS2 region and were used for phylogenetic analysis. The analysis included sequences from representative isolates of C. acutatum from strawberry (Cha-s, France; 1267b, France; F3c, France; F3e, France; Cooley2, United States; Coll.15a, Switzerland; and TUT 5954, Israel), tomato (BJS Tomato and Tomato ARK, United States), blackberry (Coll.14a, France), raspberry (120V.211, United States), grape (Nantana A.1, United States), and bilberry (Myrtille.a, France), of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry (1159.5d, Spain), and other Colletotrichum sequences previously sequenced by the authors as well as sequences retrieved from GenBank (Table 2). As previously demonstrated, DNA sequence analysis of the ITS2 region was more informative and exhibited greater interspecies divergence than the ITS1 region alone. Complete ITS1-2 sequences of the isolates were submitted to GenBank, with accession numbers provided in Table 2.
Analyses of pathogenicity experiments. Six plants of each of the cultivars Belrubi and Elsanta were inoculated with the tested isolates. For statistical analysis, the means of disease ratings from two experiments were pooled for each cultivar and isolate. Isolates of C. acutatum were assigned to pathogenicity group 1 when disease ratings were similar on both cvs. Belrubi and Elsanta, and to pathogenicity group 2 when cv. Belrubi was significantly more resistant (disease rating <1) than cv. Elsanta (disease rating ≥1), based on Student’s t test (P = 0.05).

RESULTS
RAPD polymorphism. Four RAPD primers were used to amplify DNA from 95 Colletotrichum isolates. Sixty-nine reproducible RAPD fragments were obtained. Each primer yielded an average of 17 RAPD fragments, ranging in size from 450 to 3,200 bp. Representative RAPD banding patterns obtained using primer OPC02 and OPA13 are shown. UPGMA cluster analysis using the 69 RAPD fragments yielded a dendrogram. The 95 isolates clustered into two distinct groups, CA and CG, representing C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, respectively. The 81 isolates of C. acutatum displayed 49 fragments. None were monomorphic or group CA-specific, whereas one was specific to all C. acutatum isolates except for isolate 120V-II. Three isolates, 120V-II from raspberry, Coll.14a from blackberry, and G4a from lupin, displayed the most divergent patterns within group CA and showed 10, 5, and 5 specific fragments for each isolate, respectively. Within the CA group, two subgroups were distinguished that encompassed the 78 remaining C. acutatum isolates: CA clonal (54 isolates) and CA-variable (24 isolates). The 54 CA clonal isolates, collected from strawberry between 1983 and 1998 in North America and Europe, displayed a salmon orange coloring in culture on PDA and clustered into one clade, present in 100% of the bootstrap-generated trees. All these isolates displayed identical banding patterns with a total of 11 monomorphic fragments, six of which were subgroup CA-clonal-specific and five of which were present in the RAPD patterns of several isolates in subgroup CA-variable. The 24 CA-variable isolates clustered into a more diverse genetic group and were collected from various host plants in North America and Europe between 1984 and 1998. These isolates, except for F3e, F3c, and 1159-2a, exhibited a pink-chromogenic coloring in PDA culture. The RAPD patterns of the 24 isolates in subgroup CA-variable displayed 22 fragments, eight of which were monomorphic. Five monomorphic fragments were specific to subgroup CA-variable. The CA-variable isolates of C. acutatum could be separated into two subgroups present in 99
Sequence and phylogenetic analysis. Sequence analyses were conducted on representative isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum (CA) clonal, CA variable, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (CG), chosen according to RAPD analysis. Representatives of CA-clonal from strawberry included the isolates TUT 5954 from Israel and Cha-s and 1267b from France. Representatives of CA-variable included strawberry isolates F3c and F3e from France, Coll.15a from Switzerland, and Cooley2 from the United States; tomato isolates BJS Tomato and Tomato ARK from the United States; blackberry isolate Coll.14a from France; raspberry isolate 120V.2II from the United States; grape isolate Nantana A1 from the United States; and bilberry isolate Myrtille.a from France. The representative isolate 1159.5d of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry from Spain was also sequenced.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using the ITS2 region. Comparative analysis of ITS2 sequences produced a phylogenetic tree that supported the previous analysis published by Freeman et al. and Sreenivasaprasad et al. Analysis of sequences of the ITS2 fragments supported the phylogeny inferred from the RAPD dendrogram, grouping the CG isolates separately from the CA isolates. This analysis confirmed that 24 of the C. acutatum isolates, 12 from this study, were grouped separately from reference cultures of the species C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, and C. graminicola. In addition, based on ITS2 sequence analysis, two C. acutatum clusters were revealed, corresponding to the CA-clonal and CA-variable subgroups previously identified by RAPD-PCR. The three representative CA-clonal isolates were grouped together (nearly identical sequence) but apart from the other subgroup of CA variable isolates. The CA-variable isolates were further grouped into subsets indicating the diversity of these populations. The analysis was performed on ITS2 sequences of the 12 isolates mentioned above, as well as 18 additional sequences of isolates available in GenBank. It should be noted that sequences from submissions to GenBank were not independently confirmed in this study.
Pathogenicity testing. C. acutatum isolates were assigned to pathogenicity group 1 when disease ratings were similar on cultivars.
Belrubi and Elsanta were classified into pathogenicity group 2, with cv. Belrubi showing resistance (disease rating of <1), while cv. Elsanta was susceptible (disease rating of >1). All 35 C. acutatum isolates inoculated onto strawberry caused at least one developing lesion on cv. Elsanta (disease rating of >1), and were therefore considered pathogenic on strawberry. Two isolates from the CA-clonal group (i.e., isolates F7a and F2b) exhibited very low virulence and were not assigned to any pathogenic group. The remaining 29 CA-clonal group isolates were categorized into pathogenicity group 1 (15 isolates) or group 2 (14 isolates). Isolates collected between 1988 and 1994 displayed higher aggressiveness than those collected in the early 1980s. All four inoculated CA-variable isolates, collected from 1984 to 1990, were assigned to pathogenicity group 1 and showed a relatively high level of aggressiveness. The four C. gloeosporioides isolates tested for pathogenicity produced few or no necrotic symptoms on both inoculated cultivars.
The main objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of a large representative population of C. acutatum isolated from strawberry (62 isolates), primarily from Europe and the United States. Results based on RAPD and ITS2 sequence analyses provided clear genetic evidence of at least two well-characterized groups among the tested C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. The CA-clonal subgroup was homogeneous, containing isolates only from strawberry that exhibited identical RAPD patterns and nearly identical ITS2 sequence data. The larger genetic subgroup, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts, including strawberry, that exhibited variable RAPD patterns and ITS2 sequences. These two main subgroups were well-supported by bootstrap analysis of RAPD markers and sequence phylogeny. According to RAPD analysis, isolates 120V.2II, Coll.14a, and G4a of C. acutatum could not be assigned to either the CA-clonal or CA-variable subgroups, suggesting extreme variation within the broad species of C. acutatum. However, all tested isolates of C. acutatum, including these three exceptions, were grouped within the C. acutatum species, confirmed by ITS2 sequence analysis.
Past studies on C. acutatum have primarily focused on species identification, which is crucial since C. acutatum is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. However, studies using mtDNA, rDNA RFLPs, and isozymes suggested the existence of a probable clonal population of C. acutatum on strawberry. Since these markers discriminate more efficiently between species than between subgroups within one species, it was necessary to use RAPD markers to distinguish between subgroups within C. acutatum. This study confirms the existence of a CA-clonal group clearly distinct from other C. acutatum genetic subgroups, such as CA-variable. The CA-clonal group, which included 54 of the 62 strawberry isolates, is the most prevalent group from this host in France, Israel, and likely in other European countries. This subgroup also includes isolates from the United States. The larger genetic group, CA-variable, included eight additional C. acutatum strawberry isolates and 15 C. acutatum isolates from other hosts that produced orange to red or chromogenic pigments. Freeman and Rodriguez suggeste
Fig. 3 presents an internal transcribed spacer 2-based phylogenetic tree of Colletotrichum acutatum isolates alongside published sequences. This tree was generated using the neighbor-joining algorithm, with consistent branching orders across all tree construction methods utilized. The scale bar indicates an estimated 10% sequence divergence.
In the analysis of 20 out of 23 C. acutatum isolates within the subgroup CA-variable, a chromogenic trait was observed, contrasting with none of the 53 isolates in the CA-clonal group exhibiting this characteristic. This finding reinforces the notion of a polymorphic C. acutatum species, including the chromogenic isolates. The observed low genetic polymorphism in the CA-clonal subgroup, which exclusively contained strawberry isolates, aligns with the hypothesis of specialization on this host. This specialization has been previously suggested for C. acutatum isolates from almond and for C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango. Given that C. acutatum is recognized as a polymorphic and polyphagous fungus, the low genetic diversity in the CA-clonal isolates may stem from a recent clonal epidemic affecting strawberries.
The hypothesis regarding the specialization of CA-clonal isolates is further supported by their aggressive nature on certain strawberry cultivars, such as Elsanta, which received a disease rating of 5 for the most aggressive isolates. In comparison, the most aggressive isolates from the CA-variable group received a rating of 2.8. However, to confirm or refute the hypothesis of host specialization in CA-clonal isolates, these isolates would need to be inoculated on different hosts to assess any variations in virulence compared to non-CA-clonal isolates.
Sreenivasaprasad et al. indicated that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberries are distinct from U.S. isolates derived from various hosts. In this study, no correlation was detected between genetic grouping and the geographical origins of the C. acutatum isolates from strawberries. This lack of correlation could be attributed to the extensive number of analyzed strawberry isolates. The findings suggest that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from a single or limited number of origins. The introduction of C. acutatum into Europe might have occurred through the contamination of traded plant material, particularly following the importation of large quantities of everbearing-type strawberry plants from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s. This hypothesis gains further support from the identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data observed in North American and European strawberry isolates within both CA-clonal and CA-variable subgroups. Additionally, C. acutatum is prevalent in strawberry populations across Europe and various regions in the United States, including California.
The disease ratings of European Colletotrichum strains isolated from strawberries indicate a range of aggressiveness. For instance, isolates such as F2b and F7a from France exhibited low disease ratings on both Belrubi and Elsanta cultivars, while isolates like Goff from the United States showed significantly higher ratings. The data reflects a trend of increased aggressiveness among certain isolates, particularly within the CA-clonal group, highlighting the variability in pathogenicity associated with different geographic origins and genetic groups.

Vol. 93, No. 2, 2003 227 observed identical RAPD patterns in isolates of the pathogen originating from both countries also suggested the introduction of C. acutatum from the United States into Israel. Using pathogenicity testing, 35 C. acutatum European isolates, collected from strawberry and representing the CA-clonal and CA-variable genetic subgroups, were assigned to pathogenicity groups 1 and 2, as previously described. Assignment of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry to genetic subgroups and to pathogenicity groups was not correlated. Within each group, isolates varied in aggressiveness. Isolates collected after 1988 or 1994 displayed significantly higher levels of aggressiveness. The introduction of C. acutatum into Europe most likely occurred at the beginning of the 1980s. Therefore, variation in pathogenicity cannot be explained by host specialization of this group. The analysis of genetic polymorphism and variation in pathogenicity among CA-clonal isolates suggests that is
Whereas high levels of virulence were reported elsewhere for isolates of C. gloeosporioides from the southeastern United States, European isolates of C. gloeosporioides collected from strawberry exhibited low virulence and could even be considered nonpathogenic. This may be due to differences between European and southeastern United States isolates or to the temperate climatic conditions occurring in Europe. The latter hypothesis is supported by the fact that optimal growth of C. gloeosporioides is obtained in vitro at higher temperatures than that for C. acutatum. Alternatively, the low levels of virulence of C. gloeosporioides on strawberry observed in Europe could be related to limited epidemics of this species on strawberry in this region.
RAPD fragments specific to the different genetic groups of C. acutatum, CA-clonal and CA-variable, may be very useful for designing specific PCR primers for rapid and reliable detection and for differentiation between the subgroups pathogenic on strawberry. This is of particular interest for the detection of C. acutatum and identification of the genetic groups, CA-clonal or CA-variable, for epidemiological studies. Moreover, using additional primers or other markers such as AFLPs would increase the chance of detecting avirulence genes that are related to pathogenic variability. This could be used to discriminate between the two pathogenicity groups in group CA-clonal and to differentiate between the highly virulent United States isolates of C. gloeosporioides compared to the predominantly mildly virulent isolates in Europe.
