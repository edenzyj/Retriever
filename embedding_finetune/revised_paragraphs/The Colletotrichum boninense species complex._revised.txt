Abstract: Although only recently described, Colletotrichum boninense is well established in literature as an anthracnose pathogen or endophyte of a diverse range of host plants worldwide. It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognized here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii, and 12 previously undescribed species: C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae, and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are only known from New Zealand, perhaps reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was made, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified, with the name replaced by C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are the conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening that sometimes extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, as well as conidia that have a prominent basal scar. Many species in the C. boninense complex form teleomorphs in culture.

INTRODUCTION
Colletotrichum boninense was first described from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum (Amaryllidaceae) collected in the Bonin Islands, Japan (Moriwaki et al. 2003). According to these authors, the species was associated with a variety of host plants in Japan, including Clivia miniata (Amaryllidaceae), Cucumis melo (Cucurbitaceae), Cattleya sp., Cymbidium sp., and Dendrobium kingianum (Orchidaceae), Passiflora edulis (Passifloraceae), and Prunus mume (Rosaceae). Since 2003, C. boninense (in its wide sense prior to our research) has frequently been identified as a pathogen causing fruit and leaf anthracnose, as well as an endophyte of a range of host plants worldwide, especially belonging to Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. For example, C. boninense was found to be associated with diseases of Leucospermum and Protea cynaroides in Australia and Zimbabwe and with Eucalyptus in South Africa (Lubbe et al. 2004). In pathogenicity studies, it was shown to infect Protea leaves and stems (Lubbe et al. 2006). Farr et al. (2006) reported C. boninense on Dracaena and Pachira in China, Passiflora in New Zealand, and Hippeastrum in Brazil and the Netherlands. According to Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005), C. boninense (= C. gloeosporioides groups E–I in Johnston & Jones 1997) occurs on a range of hosts, including Capsicum, Citrus, Cucurbita, and Solanum species in New Zealand. Colletotrichum boninense was reported as the cause of anthracnose of pepper (Capsicum annuum) in Brazil (Tozze et al. 2009), of passion fruit (Passiflora) in Florida (Tarnowski & Ploetz 2010) and Brazil (Tozze et al. 2010), and of Crinum asiaticum in China (Yang et al. 2009). Lee et al. (2005a, b) observed leaf anthracnose on Japanese spindle tree (Euonymus japonica) in Korea and demonstrated the pathogenicity of C. boninense. Nguyen et al. (2009) reported C. boninense as a pathogen of berries and twigs of Coffea in Vietnam. Recently, C. boninense was ident

The Colletotrichum boninense species complex includes various hosts and substrates across different countries. The species entries list genetic information, such as GenBank accession numbers, along with the corresponding host organisms and their geographic locations.
For example, C. karstii is associated with Quercus salicifolia in Panama, while S. integerrimum is found in Australia. Other species, such as S. betaceum and S. lycopersicum, are reported in Colombia and New Zealand, respectively. The data further includes additional species like Stylosanthes sympodialis and Synsepalum dulcificum, highlighting a diverse range of hosts from different regions.
The information is organized in a tabular format, detailing genetic markers and species associations, showcasing the complexity of this species group and their ecological relationships with various plant hosts across the globe.
To enhance sporulation, 5-mm-diameter plugs from the margin of actively growing cultures were transferred to the center of 9-cm diameter Petri dishes containing synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA) amended with autoclaved filter paper and double-autoclaved stems of Anthriscus sylvestris placed onto the agar surface. The strains were also studied after growth on oatmeal agar (OA) or 2% potato-dextrose agar (PDA). Cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements and photographs of characteristic structures were made according to methods described by Damm et al. Appressoria on hyphae were observed on the reverse side of colonies grown on SNA plates. Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure, and observed with a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope or with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using differential interference contrast illumination. Colony characteristics and pigment production on SNA and OA incubated at 20 °C were noted after 10 days. Colony colors were rated according to Rayner. Growth rates were measured after 7 and 10 days.
Genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted using the method of Damm et al. The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), beta tubulin (TUB2), histone 3 (HIS3), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified and sequenced using specific primer pairs. The PCRs were performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 12.5 μL. The GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1, TUB2, HIS3, and CAL PCR mixture contained diluted genomic DNA, specific primers, PCR buffer, magnesium chloride, dNTPs, DMSO, and Taq DNA polymerase. Conditions for amplification included an initial denaturation step, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension, ending with a final denaturation step. The DNA sequences obtained from forward and reverse primers were used to obtain consensus sequences, which were added to the outgroup and aligned using sequence alignment software. To determine whether the seven sequence datasets were congruent and combinable, tree topologies were compared visually. A maximum parsimony analysis was performed on the multilocus alignment with specific phylogenetic software.
Analysis Using Parsimony v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2000) employed the heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing, and all characters were unordered and of equal weight. The robustness of the trees obtained was evaluated by 500 bootstrap replications with two random sequence additions (Hillis & Bull, 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting tree. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck, 2003) for the Damm et al. combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3 were included for each gene partition. The analyses of two MCMC chains were run from random trees for one million generations and sampled every 100 generations. The likelihood scores of the two runs were 2730 and 2170; therefore, the first 2450 trees (the average of both) were discarded as the burn-in phase of the analysis, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. Sequences derived in this study were lodged at GenBank, and the alignment was submitted to TreeBASE, with taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (Crous et al., 2004a).
RESULTS Phylogeny
The seven sequence datasets did not show any conflicts in tree topology for the 70% reciprocal bootstrap trees, which allowed us to combine them. In the multigene analyses (gene boundaries of ITS: 1–561, GAPDH: 572–864, CHS-1: 875–1154, HIS3: 1164–1562, ACT: 1573–1851, TUB2: 1862–2363, CAL: 2374–2823) of 87 isolates of C. boninense and related Colletotrichum species, including the outgroup, 2823 characters, including the alignment gaps, were processed, of which 572 characters were parsimony informative, 247 were parsimony-uninformative, and 2004 were constant. After a heuristic search using PAUP, 958 most parsimonious trees were retained (length = 1423 steps, CI = 0.740, RI = 0.927, RC = 0.686, HI = 0.260), of which one is shown in the figure. The topology of the 958 trees was similar, verified for a large selection of trees. They differed in the position of taxa within the subclades and the position of strain CBS 130241. For Bayesian analysis, a HKY+G model was selected for ACT and CAL, SYM+I+G for ITS, K80+I+G for CHS-1, GTR+I+G for HIS3, and HKY+I for GAPDH and TUB2, and incorporated in the analysis. The consensus tree obtained from Bayesian analyses confirmed the tree topology obtained with parsimony, as well as the bootstrap support. The analyses resulted in the detection of 18 clades, which we accept as representing different Colletotrichum species. More than half of all strains included cluster in the first clade (C. karstii) with a bootstrap support of 96% and a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. Two single strain clades, representing C. phyllanthi and C. annellatum, group with this large
C. brasiliense consists of three and two strains respectively, and these are well supported (100/1.00). They group (100/1.00) with a single strain clade (C. parsonsiae). The C. constrictum clade (100/1.00) contains two strains, and the single strain clade representing C. dacrycarpi is on very long branches, grouping with a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. The individual alignments and trees of the seven single genes were also compared regarding their performance in species recognition. With ITS and CHS-1, only 7 and 9 species can be recognized, while TUB2 cannot separate some species close to C. boninense. With HIS3 and CAL, some species differ by only one or two base pairs and form either no clades or only short-branched clades. With GAPDH, all clades are recognized, but some are also short-branched, especially the single strain clades of C. beeveri and C. brassicicola, which are well differentiated from almost all other genes except for ITS. With ACT, intraspecific variability is very high in some species, which could lead to misidentifications.
The 86 isolates studied are assigned to 18 species within the Colletotrichum boninense complex based on DNA sequence data and morphology, including 12 species that are new to science. Ten species form teleomorph stages in vitro, four species have known anamorphs described in Colletotrichum, while one species, G. phyllanthi, has a known teleomorph and is included in the Colletotrichum boninense species complex. All species studied in culture are characterized below. Species of Colletotrichum represent anamorphic stages of Glomerella. Anamorph and teleomorph names of fungi will have equal status under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, with the deletion of Article 59, which takes effect on January 1, 2013. The decision was qualified by a stipulation that the uptake of names of anamorphic genera that predate well-known competing teleomorphic names should be ratified by a committee of the International Commission for the Taxonomy of Fungi. The name Colletotrichum (Corda 1831) predates Glomerella (Spauld. & H. Schrenk 1903) and is more commonly used. Consequently, we name the new holomorphs as species of Colletotrichum and do not name the new sexual morphs separately. Furthermore, G. phyllanthi is combined in Colletotrichum as C. phyllanthi. There is precedent for this, as Rojas et al. (2010) described Colletotrichum ignotum as having a teleomorph, although the teleomorphic structures were not included in the formal species diagnosis.

From its description, G. heveae belongs to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate; it has conidia that measure 12–17 × 3.5–5 µm (i.e., narrower than those of C. annellatum) and conidiogenous cells (“basidia”) measuring 20–34 × 2 µm. Typification of neither species is easy. The only potential type material of either species in K contains a single packet labeled in Petch’s handwriting with “Gloeosporium brunneum Petch & Colletotrichum heveae Petch, no. 2228. On Hevea, 7 Oct. 1905; type of Colletotrichum heveae.” The packet contains two young leaves, apparently with only one fungus, corresponding to the description of G. heveae rather than C. heveae. The name G. brunneum Petch was apparently never published (it would be a later homonym of G. brunneum Ellis & Everh. 1889), and it seems most likely that Petch changed the name of this species between collection and publication. Petch’s names cannot therefore be unequivocally typified, but it seems certain that neither provides an earlier name for C. annellatum. Most Colletotrichum isolates derived from Hevea plants have been found to belong to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes. However, one isolate from Hevea guianensis in Peru has an ITS sequence placing it in the C. boninense species complex, within C. karstii or C. phyllanthi. The ITS sequence of C. annelatum differs in two base pairs from C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Further research is needed to clarify the placement of the strain from Peru.
Colletotrichum beeveri Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560735. Etymology: Named after Ross Beever, a New Zealand mycologist and fungal geneticist, who collected the plant material from which this species was isolated. Teleomorph not observed. On SNA, Anthriscus stem/filter paper and OA, closed round structures were observed that could be undeveloped ascomata; neither conidia nor ascospores were produced. The anamorph developed on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1.5–7 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores and setae are formed directly from vegetative hyphae or on pale brown, thick-walled angular cells measuring 3–6.5 µm in diameter. Setae are dark brown, smooth-walled, 1–3-septate, 50–100 µm long, with a bas
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata acervular, conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of medium brown, thick-walled angular cells, 3–10 µm diam. Setae (only a few observed at the margin of acervuli) dark brown, smooth-walled, 2–3-septate, 80–95 µm long, base conical to cylindrical, 4.5–6 µm diam, tip roundish to ± acute. Conidiophores pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, to 20 µm long. Conidiogenous cells pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, short cylindrical to ampulliform, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, 9–15 × 4.5–5.5 µm, opening 1–1.5 µm diam, collarette < 0.5 µm long, periclinal thickening distinct. Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, the apex and base rounded, with a prominent scar, contents granular or guttulate, sometimes with two big guttules, (12.5–)12–14(–15.5) × 5.5–6.5 µm, mean ± SD = 14.3 ± 0.8 × 6.0 ± 0.4 µm, L/W ratio = 2.4.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, with filter paper, Anthriscus stem, and partly agar medium covered with orange to black conidiomata and filter paper partly with white mycelium; reverse hyaline with black spots mainly under the filter paper, measuring 22.5–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–37 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, buff, primrose to greenish olivaceous with orange, dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata, and partly with short floccose white aerial mycelium; reverse buff, pale purplish grey, primrose, greenish olivaceous to iron-grey with olivaceous grey spots due to the conidiomata/ascomata shining through, measuring 26.5–29 mm in 7 days (39–40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are salmon to orange.
Material examined: New Zealand, Great Barrier Island, from brown lesions on a leaf of Brachyglottis repanda, R.E. Beever, 23 Mar. 2006
Teleomorph developed on OA (CBS 123756). Ascomata are perithecia, variable in shape but usually subglobose to pyriform, glabrous, medium brown, measuring 100–300 × 100–200 µm, ostiolate, periphysate, with a hyaline to pale brown neck up to 100 µm in length. The outer wall is composed of flattened angular cells 4–15 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue consists of irregular, thin-walled, hyaline septate paraphyses. Asci are arranged in a basal fascicle, cylindric-clavate, measuring 45–60 × 12.5–17 µm, 8-spored, with a ± truncate apex and a small refractive apical ring. Ascospores are initially hyaline and aseptate, becoming 1–3-septate, with septation sometimes occurring inside the ascus. They are light to medium brown-pigmented, occasionally verruculose prior to germination, allantoid, measuring (12.5–)14–17(–18) × (4–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.6 ± 1.4 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.9.
The anamorph developed on SNA (CBS 123755). Vegetative hyphae are 1–6 µm in diameter, hyaline or pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are poorly or not developed, with conidiophores and setae forming directly on hyphae. Setae are rare, medium brown, smooth to verruculose, 1–2-septate, measuring 20–60 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated base 3–7 µm in diameter at the widest part, and a tip that is ± rounded. Conidiophores are hyaline or pale brown, simple or septate, branched or unbranched, up to 40 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline or pale brown, cylindrical, measuring 6–15 × 3–5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, and a collarette 0.5–1.5 µm long, showing conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a round apex and a round base featuring a prominent hilum, often containing two large polar guttules, measuring (8.5–)11–14.5(–17.5) × (4–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.8 ± 1.6 × 5.4 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.4.
MAFF 306094. Australia, from Leucospermum sp., culture CBS 129831. New Zealand, Northland, Kaipara, from flowers of Solanum betaceum, 1 Feb. 2004, M. Manning, culture CBS 128549. Notes: Conidia of C. boninense are similar to those of C. karstii, although the ascospores of C. boninense are more uniform with rounded ends, becoming brown and septate with age, and the asci are longer and wider. We recognize that there is significant genetic variation in C. boninense. Host plants of C. boninense s. str. are very diverse, including Amaryllidaceae, Bignoniaceae, Podocarpaceae, Proteaceae, Solanaceae, and Theaceae. Several ITS sequences, for example HM044131 from Oryza granulata and FJ449913 from Dendrobium sp., both presumably from China, are similar to the ITS of C. boninense, C. oncidii, and C. cymbidiicola, but these species cannot be separated from each other by comparison of ITS sequences.
Colletotrichum brasiliense Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous & Massola, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560736. Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Brazil. Teleomorph not observed. Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–5.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, thin-walled, angular cells measuring 3–9 µm in diameter; however, in strain CBS 128528, conidiophores and setae are formed directly on hyphae. Setae are sparse, pale to medium brown, with the basal cell usually paler, smooth to finely verruculose, 2–4-septate, 50–60 µm long, with a cylindrical to conical base measuring 6–8 µm in diameter, and the tip is acute to slightly roundish or zig-zag-shaped. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ellipsoidal, encased in a mucous sheath, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–14 × 4.5–7.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter, a visible collarette ≤ 0.5 µm long, and visible periclinal thickening. In strain CBS 128528, conidiogenous cells are longer (12–25 µm) with conspi
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex is characterized by conidia that are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and a prominent scar. The contents are granular or guttulate, measuring (13–)13.5–16(–19) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.8 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in an L/W ratio of 2.8. The conidia of strain CBS 128528 are longer, measuring (13–)14–19(–22.5) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.7 ± 2.5 × 5.1 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.3.
Culture characteristics show colonies on SNA to be flat with an entire margin, hyaline, and pale cinnamon, resembling Anthriscus stem, with orange to black conidiomata on the stem. The filter paper is partly rosy buff, grey to black, covered with white mycelium and grey to black conidiomata; the reverse exhibits the same colors with black spots primarily under the filter paper, measuring 21–21.5 mm in 7 days (32.5–33.5 mm in 10 days). On OA, colonies are also flat with an entire margin, buff, with a greenish olivaceous center and orange to black conidiomata, lacking aerial mycelium; the reverse is buff, grey olivaceous to olivaceous grey towards the center, measuring 21.5 mm in 7 days (32–33.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear orange.
Material examined includes collections from Brazil, Sao Paulo, Bauru City, from fruit anthracnose of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa on 1 June 2006 by N. Massola and H.J. Tozze Jr. The holotype is CBS H-20697, with culture ex-type CBS 128501 = ICMP 18607 = PAS12. Another collection is from fruit of Passiflora edulis, with CBS H-20696, culture CBS 128528 = ICMP 18606 = PAS10.
Notes indicate that four species in the C. boninense complex occur on Passiflora: C. brasiliense from Brazil (on fruits), C. colombiense from Colombia (on leaves), C. torulosum from New Zealand (on leaves), and C. karstii from Japan and Colombia (on leaves) and from Brazil (on fruits). Johnston & Jones (1997) noted that C. gloeosporioides Group E (= C. novae-zelandiae) and C. gloeosporioides Group I (= C. constrictum) have also been isolated from Passiflora, though this remains unconfirmed by molecular methods.
The lengths of Colletotrichum spp. can sometimes exceed 20 µm, but their average length is 16.5 µm, and their length-to-width (L/W) ratio is 3.3, rather than the 3.5–4.25 range implied by Siemaszko’s measurements. Colletotrichum passiflorae F. Stevens & P.A. Young (Stevens 1925), described on fruits of P. laurifolia and leaves of P. edulis from Hawaii, U.S.A., might be an earlier name for several species of the boninense complex. However, von Arx (1957) treated it as a synonym of the gloeosporioides complex, and its description—“Acervuli black, numerous, 90–225 µm in diameter. Setae brown, 50–75 by 5 µm. Conidia granular, cylindrical 11–18 by 3.5–6 µm” (Stevens 1925)—is inadequate for assessing its identity. The setae of C. constrictum, C. novae-zelandiae, C. karstii, and C. torulosum are longer than the lengths quoted for C. passiflorae by Stevens, but different growth conditions make such comparisons unreliable. No living cultures of C. passiflorae appear to have been maintained, so we must regard the name as of uncertain application. It is not available for any species of the C. boninense complex as it is a later homonym of C. passiflorae Siemaszko. The name Gloeosporium passifloricola Sawada [as “passifloricolum”] was introduced for a fungus on Passiflora quadrangularis in Taiwan (Sawada 1943), but the name was invalidly published and cannot threaten any of the species presented in our paper.
Colletotrichum brassicicola Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560737. Etymology: Named after the host plant genus, Brassica. The teleomorph develops on Anthriscus stems. Ascomata are globose to subglobose, pale brown, measuring 100–250 × 90–150 µm, glabrous and ostiolate, with a neck that is hyaline to pale brown. The outer wall is composed of flattened angular cells measuring 8–19.5 × 5.5–15.5 µm. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses, which are hyaline, septate, branched, and measure 55–100 × 4–8 µm. Asci are cylindrical, measuring 65–105 × 12–13.5 µm and are 8-spored. Ascospores (only 7 observed) are arranged biseriately, hyaline, aseptate, fusiform, sometimes broader towards one side, sometimes curved, smooth, measuring (15–)17.3–21
Anamorph developed on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of hyaline to pale brown, angular cells, measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, with the base often paler, smooth to verruculose, 1–2-septate, and range from 25 to 60 µm long. The base is cylindrical to conical, often slightly inflated, measuring 4–7.5 µm in diameter, with a round tip. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, and up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, clavate to ellipsoidal, measuring 5–16 × 3.5–5 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter and a collarette 0.5–1 µm long, featuring visible to conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to clavate, with a round apex and base featuring a prominent scar, often guttulate and occasionally with one or two large guttules, measuring (9–)11.5–13.5(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.4 ± 1 × 5.6 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.2. On filter paper, and less frequently on Anthriscus stem, dark brown to black, roundish closed conidiomata are formed, measuring up to 400 µm in diameter and opening by irregular rupture. The conidia in this context are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and irregularly shaped, possibly deformed due to pressure within the conidiomata, measuring (7.5–)10–14.5(–18) × (4.5–)5–7(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.2 ± 2.3 × 6.2 ± 0.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.0.
Culture characteristics reveal colonies on SNA as flat with entire margins, hyaline with felty white aerial mycelium on both Anthriscus stem and filter paper, and salmon to orange acervuli with black sclerotia/ascomata on filter paper. The reverse side of the filter paper appears rosy buff to hazel, with black sclerotia/ascomata shining through, measuring 17.5–21 mm in 7 days (27.5–31.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are also flat with entire margins; the surface is buff, pale luteous to greenish olivaceous, partly covered with olivaceous grey structures, orange spore masses, and felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium. The reverse side is honey colored, pale luteous to isabe

An isolate on Passiflora sp. from Colombia (Pass-65, Afanador Kafuri et al. 2003) has the same ITS sequence as C. brassicicola, and isolates from leaves of Podocarpus totara and Prumnopitys ferruginea in New Zealand (Joshee et al. 2009) differ by only two or three substitutions in ITS sequences. We cannot be sure whether these strains belong to C. brassicicola or to other segregates of the C. boninense group. Colletotrichum colombiense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560738.
Fig. 7. Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Colombia. The teleomorph has not been observed, but spherical structures lacking any conidia or ascospores were found on the surface of the agar and within the medium. The anamorph appears on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–6 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores are not observed. Conidiomata are absent; conidiophores form directly from vegetative hyphae. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 50 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, sometimes slightly inflated, surrounded by several mucous layers, and often extend to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–18 × 3.5–5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter. The collarette and periclinal thickening are not observed. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, and contents that are granular or guttulate, often containing two large guttules, measuring (11.5–)12–14(–15.5) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.1 ± 1.0 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm and a length-to-width ratio of 2.3. Appressoria are single, medium to dark brown, roundish to elliptical, with u

The Colletotrichum boninense species complex is isabelline, partly covered with salmon, grey to black conidiomata, with aerial mycelium lacking; reverse buff to olivaceous grey, measuring 26–26.5 mm in 7 days (37–39 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon.
Material examined: Colombia, Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, from a leaf of Passiflora edulis, 22 Jan. 2010, D. Riascos, (CBS H-20699 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129818 = G2); Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, from a leaf of Passiflora edulis, 5 Nov. 2009, D. Riascos, CBS H-20700, culture CBS 129817 = G1.
Notes: Sequences of C. colombiense form a sister group to C. beeveri and C. brassicicola. It differs from C. beeveri in morphology by having setae that are verrucose and rounded, and shorter conidiogenous cells. Other species isolated from Passiflora have pigmented conidiogenous cells (C. brasiliense and C. karstii on the media used here) or much more complex appressoria (C. torulosum). See under C. brasiliense for a discussion of previously published Colletotrichum taxa associated with Passiflora. Many other isolates from Passiflora sp. in the study by Afanador-Kafuri et al. (2003) have the same or similar ITS sequence as C. colombiense but cannot be identified on the basis of ITS alone due to the close relationship of the three species.
Colletotrichum constrictum Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560739. Etymology: The name refers to the shape of the ascospores, which are often constricted. Teleomorph on SNA. Ascomata perithecia, formed after 4 weeks, solitary, non-stromatic, ovoid to obpyriform, ostiolate, glabrous, medium brown, measuring 120–200 × 90–150 µm. Peridium is 6–10 µm thick, composed of medium brown, flattened angular cells, 7–15 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, delicate, and rarely visible. Interascal tissue is formed of paraphyses, hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly cylindrical but tapering towards the round tip, disintegrating quickly, septate, branched, very variable, slightly constricted at the septa, apically free, measuring 40–95
Conidiomata are absent, with conidiophores and setae formed directly from vegetative hyphae or from a reduced cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are pale to medium brown, verruculose, 1–4-septate, and range from 65 to 130 µm in length, with a cylindrical base that is sometimes slightly inflated, measuring 4.5–6.5 µm in diameter and an acute tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, aseptate or septate, branched, and can be up to 70 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–20 × 3–7.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter, a collarette of ≤ 0.5 µm, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and a prominent scar. Their dimensions are (8.5–)12–15(–16) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.3 ± 1.5 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.3. In strain CBS 128503, occasionally globose to subglobose conidia are observed, measuring 9–13 × 7–13 µm. Appressoria occur singly or in small groups of 2–3, are medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, and ovate to bullet-shaped, with an undulate to lobate margin, measuring (5–)7.5–12(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–7.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.7 ± 2.4 × 6.5 ± 1.1 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5. The anamorph is found on the stem of Anthriscus.
Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells measuring 2.5–8 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, with a basal cell often paler, verruculose, 2–4-septate, and measuring 70–150 µ
In blastn searches, no ITS sequence was found with more than 96% identity; matches with other genes were ≤ 93% identical. The lack of matches may indicate that C. constrictum has a restricted distribution. Colletotrichum constrictum was previously referred to as C. gloeosporioides group I by Johnston & Jones (1997) and is only known from New Zealand. Isolates studied here are from Citrus sp. and Solanum betaceum. According to Johnston & Jones (1997), the species also occurs on Passiflora edulis and P. mollissima, although this has not been confirmed by molecular methods.
Colletotrichum constrictum (from ex-holotype strain CBS 128504) exhibits several structures: conidiomata, conidiophores, setae, appressoria, conidia, ascomata, and ascospores, with detailed features described including sizes and shapes. The scale bars indicate different measurement units for various structures, with specific dimensions provided for clarity.
Colletotrichum cymbidiicola Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560740. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Cymbidium. The teleomorph on SNA features ascomata perithecia, which are formed after four weeks. They are solitary, semi-immersed or immersed in the agar medium, non-stromatic, subspherical to ovoid, ostiolate, glabrous, and medium brown, measuring 130–160 × 170–220 µm. The peridium is 10–12 µm thick, composed of pale to medium brown flattened angular cells 3.5–15 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, delicate, and rarely visible. Interascal tissue was not observed. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical, tapering to apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 40–48 × 9.5–11 µm, with a truncate base and apex 3.5–4 µm wide. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, fusiform, slightly curved, with a rounded base and acute or rounded apex, measuring (12.5–)15–18(–21) × 5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.5 ± 1.6 × 5.6 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.0.
In the teleomorph on Anthriscus stem, ascomata perithecia are formed after four weeks.
