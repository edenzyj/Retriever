Lifestyles of Colletotrichum acutatum
Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds is a common pathogen of a wide array of crops and non-cultivated plant species. The fungus is cosmopolitan in its distribution and causes extensive crop losses every year. Disease symptoms range from fruit rots to shoot, leaf, and flower blights. Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, but serious diseases on leatherleaf fern and pines have also been reported. There are no known reports of C. acutatum affecting grasses.
Although C. acutatum has been well documented from agricultural hosts, recent reports of its recovery from a moribund sea turtle and a native forest suggest that this fungus may inhabit other less-studied niches. C. acutatum was first described as a separate species by Simmonds. Many of the isolates now known to be C. acutatum were either included in C. gloeosporioides or were considered to be species of Gloeosporium. C. acutatum affects many hosts that are also attacked by other Colletotrichum species, which may have contributed to the failure to recognize it as a separate taxon. For example, strawberry is affected by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae. C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae usually cause petiole and stolon lesions and crown rot on strawberry, but may also produce fruit symptoms.
C. acutatum produces symptoms on flowers, leaves, petioles, and roots, but is most significant as a fruit rot of strawberry. Citrus, apples, mangos, papayas, and avocados are also affected by both C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. On citrus, C. gloeosporioides is a common saprophyte and may cause postharvest anthracnose from preharvest quiescent infections. C. acutatum does not produce postharvest anthracnose on citrus fruit, but causes distinct diseases on different species of citrus, such as postbloom fruit
Lifestyles of Colletotrichum acutatum
Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds is a common pathogen affecting a wide array of crops and noncultivated plant species. This enigmatic fungus is cosmopolitan in its distribution and orchestrates extensive crop losses each year. Disease symptoms present a captivating tapestry ranging from fruit rots to blights on shoots, leaves, and flowers. Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberries, apples, citrus, and stone fruits, but serious diseases have also been reported on leatherleaf fern and pines. Notably, there are no known reports of C. acutatum affecting grasses.
Although C. acutatum has been well documented from agricultural hosts, recent discoveries of this fungus in a moribund sea turtle and a native forest suggest it may inhabit other less-studied niches, beckoning further investigation. Initially described as a separate species by Simmonds, many isolates now classified as C. acutatum were previously included in C. gloeosporioides or considered species of Gloeosporium. This labyrinth of classification may explain the difficulty in recognizing it as a distinct taxon, particularly since C. acutatum affects many hosts also targeted by other Colletotrichum species. For instance, strawberries are afflicted by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae, with the latter two typically causing petiole and stolon lesions as well as crown rot, though they can also produce fruit symptoms.
C. acutatum manifests symptoms on flowers, leaves, petioles, and roots, but is most significant as a fruit rot of strawberries. Additionally, citrus, apples, mangos, papayas, and avocados are affected by both C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. In citrus, C. gloeosporioides is often a common saprophyte, causing postharvest anthracnose from preharvest quiescent infections. Conversely, C. acutatum does not induce postharvest anthracnose on citrus fruit but results in distinct diseases across various citrus species, such as postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose. In apples, bitter rot is attributed to both C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. While a leaf spot disease caused by Glomerella cingulata has been documented in Brazil and the United States, C. acutatum is not known to attack apple leaves.
Recent research has been dedicated to elucidating the etiology of diseases caused by Colletotrichum spp. and the intricate population dynamics of these pathogens. This work emphasizes the differe
Less effort has been dedicated to determining the life cycle of C. acutatum in each situation, its means of survival and dissemination, and its host specificity. In this article, we will assess the status of our knowledge on the lifestyles of C. acutatum, including infection and colonization strategies on different hosts, the role of various asexual structures such as conidia and appressoria, and the role of the sexual stage in selected disease cycles. To define lifestyles more effectively, we needed to clarify the taxonomy of the fungus and differentiate those diseases caused by C. acutatum from those caused by other species of Colletotrichum. We also explore our understanding of the ability of C. acutatum to move between hosts and cause disease, as well as the genetic relatedness of isolates of C. acutatum from different hosts. Information in some areas is limited, and we identify gaps in our understanding of diseases caused by C. acutatum and potential areas for future research.
Taxonomic Relationships
Morphology of C. acutatum. C. acutatum is an Ascomycete classified in the Pyrenomycetes and included in the family Phyllachoraceae. Colonies of C. acutatum are usually white initially and later become covered with pink to orange conidial masses. Cultures from some hosts are highly chromogenic and excrete red and pink pigments into the culture media. The primary production of conidia occurs in acervuli; however, C. acutatum is also capable of forming secondary conidia on the surface of living leaves. Conidia are usually ellipsoid and fusiform at least at one end, rather than typically having both ends rounded like C. gloeosporioides. Setae are usually sparse if produced at all. Pigmented appressoria are produced upon germination of the conidia and vary in shape and size. The sexual stage of certain genetic subgroups of C. acutatum has been characterized under laboratory conditions and has been designated as Glomerella acutata. A large number of isolates from diverse hosts were capable of mating and forming mature perithecia in culture. Crosses within isolates in group C, and some intergroup crosses, were highly fertile, but others were weakly fertile or infertile. However, mating compatibility in C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species is complex.
Differentiation of C. acutatum from other species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, the presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been used for the differentiation of species in the genus Colletotrichum. Morphological traits, however, are highly variable among isolates and often subject to interpretation. Other characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have been helpful in differenti
As pointed out by Freeman, multiple hosts can be affected by a single species, and multiple species can affect a single host. Simmonds first described C. acutatum as a new species, distinct from C. gloeosporioides, based on isolates from fruit rots in Australia. Additional detailed morphological descriptions were published later. Most fungi included in C. acutatum were formerly assigned to C. gloeosporioides, with the teleomorph being Glomerella cingulata. Many species formerly considered to be Gloeosporium are now also included in C. acutatum. In recent years, different tools, such as vegetative compatibility groups and isozymes, as well as molecular tools like random amplification of polymorphic DNA (RAPD), species-specific primers, and sequencing of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region of nuclear ribosomal DNA and other regions of the genome, have been useful in separating C. acutatum from other species of Colletotrichum. While the role and identity of species involved in anthracnose diseases is not always clear, we now have a much better understanding of the different species and the means available to differentiate them. Almond anthracnose, for example, was thought to be caused by C. gloeosporioides, based on the morphology of the pathogen. More recently, almond isolates from California and Israel have been identified as C. acutatum primarily through the use of molecular tools. Such tools have been very useful in determining not only the identities of isolates but also the relationships among them. The citrus postbloom fruit drop pathogen was also originally identified as C. gloeosporioides, but was later found to be C. acutatum.
C. acutatum sensu lato may be considered a group species, and the relationships among populations from different host plants are not clear. Two subspecific forms or physiological taxa of C. acutatum have been described: C. acutatum f. sp. pineum and C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum. C. acutatum f. sp. pineum was not separated from C. acutatum morphologically and was designated primarily on the basis of its pathogenicity to pines. C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum was distinguished based on pink and red pigments in the agar medium in culture. Sutton did not feel either subspecific designation was valid. However, populations of C. acutatum ha
Variation in colony color and morphology among cultures of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu Simmonds is observed, although chromogenic isolates are not illustrated. The rings seen in the cultures are due to alternating light and dark cycles. Typical conidia are depicted. The teleomorph of Colletotrichum acutatum, known as Glomerella acutata, shows a mating system on toothpicks in culture, with perithecia formed on toothpicks as well. A close-up of the perithecia is included, alongside images of asci with ascospores.
The study included pine isolates designated as C. acutatum f. sp. pineum, while another group contained isolates of Glomerella miyabeana from willow. Guerber et al. supported the recognition of G. miyabeana as a distinct species from C. acutatum, but further research did not confirm the pine group as a unique population. In research on anthracnose isolates from lupine, Nirenberg et al. described a new species, C. lupini, based on morphological, physiological, and molecular criteria. Guerber et al. identified that lupine isolates belonged to subgroups J2 and J6, differentiating them from other C. acutatum isolates, including one from France categorized as C. lupini by Nirenberg et al. Talhinhas et al. also classified all lupine isolates as C. acutatum, indicating a distinct subgroup from other hosts. Despite the identification of new species such as C. lupini and G. miyabeana, C. acutatum remains a genetically distinct group of closely related isolates.
Groupings of isolates based on host or geographic region do not always align with those determined by molecular criteria. Freeman et al. characterized C. acutatum isolates from Israel using arbitrarily primed PCR and AT-rich DNA analyses, identifying four subgroups. Subgroup confirmations were made using sequences of the ITS 2 region or the complete ITS region. Freeman’s subgroup I included isolates from almond, apple, peach, and pecan from the United States, while Israeli isolates from almond were in subgroup IV. Guerber et al. found that isolates from various hosts and countries fell into the same genetic subgroups. Their subgroup C comprised isolates from almond, apple, avocado, blueberry, cherimoya, citrus, cranberry, dodder, grape, strawberry, and kiwi from the United States and New Zealand. However, isolates from key lime and other citrus, as well as those from leatherleaf fern in Florida, were placed in Guerber’s subgroup J, alongside lupine isolates fr
Thus, the general conclusion from most of the research is that C. acutatum is composed of genetic subgroups that show little indication of host specificity, although there are some indications of specialization of certain isolates on particular hosts. As noted above, isolates from key lime formed a single group. Studies by Peres et al. using sequences of the entire ITS region and the 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase gene, as well as RAPDs, found that isolates from postbloom fruit drop–affected citrus flowers from Brazil, Costa Rica, Belize, Mexico, the Dominican Republic, and Florida were closely related and did not group based on geographic origin. Isolates from key lime from the same countries were also very closely related but differed slightly from the postbloom fruit drop isolates. Thus, isolates from postbloom fruit drop on sweet orange and those from key lime anthracnose form two separate populations regardless of their country of origin. The situation in citrus presents an interesting opportunity to study the evolution of pathogenicity and the movement of pathogens between hosts and countries. Postbloom fruit drop is of rather recent origin. The disease and its causal agent were first described in Belize in 1979. However, there are informal reports and letters from the late 1950s and the 1960s describing the symptoms on citrus in Belize and Colombia. Postbloom fruit symptoms are obvious, and the effects on yield are dramatic; thus, it would be unlikely that the disease would have gone unnoticed for extended periods in commercial citrus groves. Reports of key lime anthracnose go back at least to the early 1900s. It was proposed originally that postbloom fruit drop may have originated when isolates from key lime anthracnose moved into other citrus species. The molecular data of Peres et al. are not inconsistent with that hypothesis, but if the populations of C. acutatum on key lime and other citrus species have common ancestors, they probably diverged some time ago. Indications are that postbloom fruit drop isolates were distributed to all of the citrus-growing areas of the Americas within 30 to 40 years, probably by the movement of plant material bearing appressoria.
Symptoms caused by C. acutatum are primarily necroses, including blights on various types of host tissues such as leaves, petioles, flowers, fruit, or even roots across a wide range of hosts. However, the pathogen is not a general necrotroph attacking only young or senescent tissues.
The table describes the plant tissues affected by C. acutatum across selected hosts, including apple/peach, blueberry, sweet orange, strawberry, key lime, and almond. Symptoms are noted for various plant tissues such as young leaves/twigs, flowers, fruit p
