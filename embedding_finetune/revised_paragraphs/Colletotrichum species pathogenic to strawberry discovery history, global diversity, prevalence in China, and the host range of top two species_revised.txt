Abstract
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, being ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the top ten economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since it was first reported in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In a sense, producing organic strawberries is impracticable largely because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry have been widely characterized. The review focused on providing an accurate inventory of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry by revisiting the discovery history scrupulously over 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa were accepted as strawberry pathogens, with global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry was systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the prevailing C. fructicola and C. siamense, the top two Colletotrichum species causing serious damage globally, was summarized, with the goal of accurate diagnosis and improved anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.

An introduction to Colletotrichum spp. and strawberry anthracnose
The genus Colletotrichum has been considered one of the global top 10 important genera of fungal pathogens. Indeed, Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. The plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on an angiosperm leaf cuticle suggest that the diversified pathogenic strategies have been well established in Colletotrichum spp. from the Late Cretaceous onwards. Different complexes in the genus Colletotrichum might have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments boosted the further diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have diversified to adapt to thousands of hosts, occurring as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes. Currently, a total of 257 Colletotrichum species grouped into 15 complexes and 13 addi

Colletotrichum is a diverse genus, with C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (s.l., complex, aggregate) and C. acutatum s.l. being the top two complexes, consisting of 57 and 41 species, respectively (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). The Rosaceae family has been reported as the plant family with the most records of association with the Colletotrichum genus, hosting as many as 41 Colletotrichum species (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Common symptoms caused by Colletotrichum fungi include postharvest fruit rot, Glomerella leaf spot, and premature defoliation, affecting apple (Zhang et al. 2021; Chen et al. 2022), pear (Fu et al. 2019), peach (Tan et al. 2022), strawberry (Eaton et al. 2021; Wang et al. 2022), and many other rosaceous plants (Dowling et al. 2020). Among these crops, strawberry is the most vulnerable to fungal diseases due to its short plant stature and soft berries that lack protective skin. One Colletotrichum species can infect all organs of the strawberry plant (Adhikari et al. 2019). Anthracnose has become a limiting factor for the ecological and sustainable development of strawberry production, posing a serious and ongoing threat to strawberry security (Zhang et al. 2012). In particular, anthracnose crown rot has a destructive impact on strawberries, significantly greater than that of other diseases. The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises because Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, often with a long latent period during which no visible symptoms appear. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al. 2017; Forcelini and Peres 2018; Hirayama et al. 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. on asymptomatic plants can be dispersed over long distances, and relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are absent in China.
The prerequisite for disease control is to recognize the causal agents. Originally, the identification of causal agents largely relied on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated subculture of microbes in vitro might alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics vary with the choice of host or environmental conditions forms a serious concern in fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks 1931). Using PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, scientists revealed the genetic delimitation among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberry and sorted those pathogens of worldwide origins into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Martínez-Culebras et al. 2000, 2003). However, doubtfully annotated data for Colletotrichum species were frequent in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al. 2006; Hyde et al. 2009). Later, the emergence of multi-locus phylogeny provided decisive assistance for the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists greatly expanded the knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a, b; Weir et al. 2012), establishing a solid basis for future research. A landmark work corrected many synonymous names and provided a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al. 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al. 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al. 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Detecting Colletotrichum pathogens, especially asymptomatic latent infections, can help avoid the spread of pathogens and prevent severe outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry fields. Techniques such as DNA microarray (Furuta et al. 2017), loop-mediated isothermal amplification (LAMP) (Wu et al. 2019; Liu et al. 2021), and quantitative real-time PCR (qPCR) assay (Yang et al. 2022) were developed for detecting Colletotrichum spp. for disease management in strawberry fields, although the targets of detection for certain species complexes were not clearly validated in those reports. A complete delineation of Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberry is not only crucial for strawberry health managers and government quarantine personnel but also provides basic information for strawberry breeders aiming to improve resistance. Despite intensive research contributing to the understanding of the Colletotrichum genus pathogenic to strawberry, there remains a lack of an accurate inventory of these causal agents, and the pathogen population and prevalence of strawberry-virulent Colletotrichum spp. have not been systematically investigated in large producers such as China. To address these gaps, the current review seeks to summarize the biodiversity of Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberry by examining the global discovery history. Thereafter, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry in China was analyzed with available data. Finally, we sorted the host range of the top two predominant species causing strawberry crown rot. Together, such knowledge has important appli
Ji et al. (2022) revised the taxonomic placement of some species and revealed novel species. The first report of the infection of strawberry by C. fragariae was noted in southeastern USA more than 90 years ago (Brooks 1931). Based on morphological observations, distinguishing C. fragariae from C. gloeosporioides, which was described in the nineteenth century for the pathogen isolated from citrus in Italy (Penzig 1882), is challenging. Consequently, early cases of strawberry anthracnose were often attributed to either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides. A significant milestone was reached with the separation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides, when the former was identified as the causal agent of strawberry fruit rot in Australia (Simmonds 1965). In the 1980s, it was suggested that C. gloeosporioides was synonymous with C. fragariae on strawberry (Howard 1983; Smith and Black 1987). Despite efforts by many pathologists to differentiate among C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum (Smith and Black 1990; Gunnell and Gubler 1992), morphological discrimination of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose remained unclear.
During the last decade of the twentieth century, strawberry anthracnose emerged as a global disease. A primer, CgInt, targeting the internally transcribed spacer (ITS) region of the ribosomal gene, was proposed to be specific to C. gloeosporioides (Mills et al. 1992) and was used for strawberry anthracnose diagnosis until 2015 (Rahman et al. 2015). By the end of the twentieth century, molecular tools became widely available, revealing significant genetic diversity within C. acutatum (Buddie et al. 1999; Martínez-Culebras et al. 2000, 2003; Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003) and C. gloeosporioides (Suzuki et al. 2010). Subsequently, C. boninense was separated from C. gloeosporioides (Moriwaki et al. 2003; Damm et al. 2012b), and C. simmondii was reassessed as a member of C. acutatum s.l. (Shivas and Tan 2009). C. theobromicola, synonymous with C. fragariae, was described as part of the C. gloeosporioides complex with a wide host range in tropical and subtropical regions (Rojas et al. 2010; Weir et al. 2012). Additionally, strains previously identified as C. truncatum were re-identified as C. lineola (Damm et al. 2009), due to the confusion arising from their similarly curved conidia (Sato et al. 2015).
In 2012, research intensified to explore the genetic boundaries within Colletotrichum species. Through multi-lo

Phytopathology Research (2022) 4:42 The actin-encoding gene (ACT) and the chitin synthase-encoding gene (CHS) (Weir et al. 2012) have been instrumental in multi-loci phylogenetic analysis using ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CHS, histone 3 (HIS3), and beta-tubulin (TUB2), which clearly delineated various species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012a). C. fructicola (from the USA and Canada), C. siamense (from the USA), and C. theobromicola (from the USA) of the C. gloeosporioides complex were formally accepted as strawberry pathogens (Weir et al. 2012). In addition, C. simmondii (from Australia) (Shivas and Tan 2009) and five additional species of the C. acutatum complex, including C. acutatum sensu stricto (s.s.), C. fioriniae (from the USA, UK, and New Zealand), C. godeiae (widely in Europe), C. nymphaeae (from the USA, Israel, and Europe), and C. salicis (from New Zealand), were classified as distinct causal agents of strawberry anthracnose (Damm et al. 2012a). Furthermore, C. miaoliense (isolated from crown and leaf tissues) of the C. acutatum complex was recognized to infect strawberries in Taiwan Province, China, although with weak virulence (Chung et al. 2020). So far, a total of seven species of the C. acutatum complex have been identified as strawberry pathogens. C. aenigma of the C. gloeosporioides complex was reported to infect strawberries in the UK (Baroncelli et al. 2015). C. gloeosporioides s.s. was isolated from diseased strawberry leaf, petiole, and stolon in Hubei Province, China, where C. murrayae was also reported as a causal agent of the disease (Han et al. 2016). In the same year, C. murrayae was proven to be conspecific with C. siamense (Liu et al. 2016). Two isolates from diseased strawberry (rhizome) in northern China were identified as a novel species named C. changpingense of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Jayawardena et al. 2016a). Within the same species complex, C. alienum (from Australia) was reported as a strawberry pathogen (Shivas et al. 2016). C. kahawae was first reported from diseased strawberries in Chiba, Japan (Gan et al. 2017). An additional species, C. viniferum of the C. gloeosporioides complex, was first reported to infect strawberry leaves in Shandong Province, China (He et al. 2019). Thus, a total of nine species of the C. gloeosporioides complex have been reported to be pathogenic to strawberries. In addition to species from the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes, C. dematium was reported to be virulent to strawberries in the USA nearly 50 years ago (Beraha and Wright 1973) and was again reported to infect strawberries in India (Si
Apart from these species from distinct complexes, there are two singleton species of the Colletotrichum genus that were not clustered with other species of any complex but were reported to infect strawberry (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). A typical strain of C. nigrum from Fragaria spp. petiole (UK) was previously reported in a study that aimed to circumscribe distinct anthracnose pathogens of several crops (Liu et al. 2013). C. coccodes, which causes strawberry fruit rot, was reported in Australia (Shivas et al. 2016). Indeed, these two singletons were phylogenetically close to each other (Liu et al. 2013). Additionally, C. paranaense of the C. acutatum complex was once suggested to be associated with Fragaria in Australia (Moreira et al. 2019), but no further record of virulent C. paranaense to strawberry is available. When examined with the barcodes of that potential C. paranaense strain from strawberry (Moreira et al. 2019) in GenBank, it was found to be a strain of C. simmondsii from Europe. In fact, C. paranaense has been considered an endemism associated with apple, peach, and nectarine in Brazil only (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Recently, in an effort to identify the causal agent of strawberry crown rot in the USA, C. clidemiae was isolated from strawberry fields alongside C. siamense (86%), C. theobromicola, and C. fructicola, but C. clidemiae was suggested as the only species not pathogenic to strawberry (Oliveira et al. 2022). Therefore, these two species (C. paranaense and C. clidemiae) are not included in the current list of strawberry pathogens. In total, 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, namely, nine species of the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species of the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. mialiense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), along with the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications. Undoubtedly, the archives of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry will expand in the future.
The diversity of Colletotrichum spp. virulent to strawberry presents a geographic perspective. So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nursery and production fields worldwide. Reports on
Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberry from literature curation at PubMed and Clarivate, combined with Fungal database search (Farr and Rossman 2022), were retrieved to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. Since 1931 until July 9, 2022, over 220 citations and 310 records referring to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the Colletotrichum genus level were documented in 36 countries across six continents. Among these, 282 records provided pathogen identification at a species or species complex level. Moreover, following the timeline of identification history, 189 records were supposed to delimit strawberry pathogens at a species level and were included in the statistics. It should be noted that early reports primarily provided pathogen information at a species complex level. Although only relevant reports on C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides after the studies by Weir et al. (2012) and Han et al. (2016), respectively, were accepted in the analysis, the frequent use of species complex names or outdated, misleading names for Colletotrichum pathogens cannot be completely excluded. For example, C. theobromicola (synonymous with C. fragariae) from the C. gloeosporioides complex was clarified many years ago, but the name C. fragariae was still used in some later publications. A similar situation occurs with the use of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides associated with strawberry in the literature. Therefore, the extent to which these records can be accurately attributed to C. acutatum s.s., C. gloeosporioides s.s., or C. theobromicola remains unknown.
A summary of worldwide reports on strawberry-pathogenic Colletotrichum spp. discriminated at the species level includes several categories. The analysis focused on records that could be unambiguously classified at a species level, and a total of 189 records were utilized for this purpose. Among the species reported, C. nymphaeae was the most frequently identified, accounting for 25.9% of the records. Other notable species included C. acutatum s.s. (18.0%) and C. fructicola (12.2%). The report also highlights that certain species complexes, such as C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum, were implicated, but details on their specific contributions varied across continents and countries.
The global diversity of Colletotrichum spp. virulent to strawberry was illustrated with identification records categorized at the species level. Reports on the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose that were dubious at a species level were excluded. It was noted that Africa produces a very small amount of strawberry. In Egypt, both the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes were reported to infect strawberry, although they were not identified at a species level. C. nymphaeae was identified as the sole Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose in Kenya and South Africa.
Strawberry is widely cultivated in America, where the diversity of strawberry pathogens is fostered. In Canada, three species, including C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), C. nymphaeae, and C. lineola (Jayawardena et al. 2016b), were reported to be infectious to strawberry. At least six Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry were revealed in the USA: C. simmondsii (Faedda et al. 2011), the dominant C. nymphaeae (Wang et al. 2019), C. siamense (Adhikari et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022), the less prevalent C. fioriniae (Wang et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021), C. fructicola, and C. theobromicola (Weir et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2022). In Mexico, only Colletotrichum spp. (genus level) from strawberry was reported (Alvarez 1976; Rojas-Flores et al. 2019). C. nymphaeae, infectious to strawberry, was recorded in Colombia and Costa Rica (Baroncelli et al. 2015). C. siamense (Capobianco et al. 2016) and C. karstii (Soares et al. 2021) were identified as infecting strawberry in Brazil. In Argentina, only the Colletotrichum species complexes (C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides) were reported to infect strawberry (Mónaco et al. 2000; Ramallo et al. 2000).
Strawberry anthracnose is widely prevalent in Asia. In Thailand, although both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes had been reported to be associated with strawberry (Photita et al. 2004; Than et al. 2008a, b; Hyde et al. 2018), the identification of Colletotrichum in strawberry at the species level was absent. In India, C. dematium was isolated from diseased strawberry (Sharma et al. 2013). In Bangladesh, C. siamense was shown to cause strawberry crown rot (Gupta et al. 2019). In Israel and Iran, C. nymphaeae was revealed to infect strawberry fruits (Jayawardena et al. 2016b; Karimi et al. 2017). In Japan, virulent C. fructicola (predominant) and C. siamense, as well as less virulent C. aenigma and C. kahawe,
Bulgaria, Switzerland, and Portugal have identified both C. godetiae and C. nymphaeae as strawberry pathogens. In the Netherlands and Spain, these species were reported as pathogens, along with other species. In the United Kingdom, five species, including the more aggressive C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae, as well as the less aggressive C. godetiae and C. aenigma, have been documented as strawberry pathogens, with C. nigrum and C. aenigma falling outside the C. acutatum complex. Belgium has reported four species from the C. acutatum complex, namely C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, and C. salicis, as strawberry pathogens. In France, C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae were also isolated from diseased strawberries. Italy identified several pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose, including C. simmondsii, C. nymphaeae, C. acutatum s.s., and C. siamense. Additionally, C. acutatum (complex) was reported to cause strawberry anthracnose rot in Germany, the Czech Republic, Finland, and Montenegro, although not identified at the species level. Overall, Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries outside the C. acutatum complex were reported only in the United Kingdom and Italy.
In Australia, at least five Colletotrichum species, including C. simmondsii, C. acutatum s.s., C. nymphaeae, C. alienum, and C. coccodes, have been reported as causing strawberry diseases. In New Zealand, species such as C. salicis and C. fioriniae have been recorded as strawberry pathogens. An overview of the global distribution of strawberry pathogenic Colletotrichum spp. indicates that the number of common species frequently found worldwide is roughly equal to those reported only in one region. Generally, Colletotrichum spp. of the C. acutatum complex are epidemic in Europe, Africa, and Oceania,
China has become the largest strawberry producer in the world since 2010, with strawberry growers in the mainland planting 173,333 hectares and producing five million tons of fruit in 2021. The diverse cultivation practices and climate conditions in China have favored a high biodiversity of various pathogens affecting strawberries. The first formal report of strawberry anthracnose in China was made by Hu in Jiangsu Province during the fifth annual conference of the Chinese Society of Plant Pathology in 1990. In Shanghai, C. fragariae and C. acutatum were identified as strawberry pathogens. Subsequently, fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was reported in Shanghai based on morphological identification. Molecular analysis using ITS sequences helped identify 16 C. gloeosporioides isolates and one C. acutatum isolate sampled between 1996 and 2006 in Shanghai. Based on ITS sequences and restriction enzyme digestion, 31 Colletotrichum isolates collected from diseased strawberries during 2006–2007 in Shanghai and Zhejiang were identified as C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae. Later, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae were again reported as pathogens for strawberries in Zhejiang. There were 114 fungal isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex collected from diseased strawberries between 2010 and 2013 in Zhejiang Province, though they were not distinguished at the species level.
The first use of multi-locus phylogenetic analysis integrated with morphological characterization by Han et al. created a new understanding of strawberry anthracnose in China. Based on 11 published works and current research that distinguished species levels, we provided insight into the overall population structure and relative prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. in strawberry fields in China. Since 2016, a total of 492 isolates belonging to 11 Colletotrichum species from four complexes—C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. truncatum—have been identified as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in China. Analysis revealed that the C. gloeosporioides complex was most widely reported. Currently, C. siamense (226 isolates, 45.9% of the total) is the most commonly reported species in strawberry fields across a wide range of latitudes in nearly all provinces, except for Liaoning, followed by C. fructicola (189 isolates, 38.4%), which is similarly distributed throughout China.
We acknowledge limitations in the above illustration due to the availability of data sources. However, the broad prevalence of the C. gloeosporioides complex on strawberries is not confined to China; C. fructicola has been identified as the predominant fungus causing strawberry anthracnose in both South Korea and Japan. The occurrence of C. acutatum s.l., C. boninense s.l., and C. truncatum s.l. species in China has been essentially random. Notably, C. nymphaeae and C. miaoliense were only identified in temperate zones such as Hebei and Beijing or from subtropical regions with elevations of approximately 1,000 meters.
Concerning the regional biodiversity in Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberry, a higher diversity could be observed in Beijing, Hubei, and Taiwan than in other regions, which might be partially explained by the diversified geographic conditions and subclimates in these areas. In fact, C. fructicola was most prevalent in Sichuan Province. In Shanghai, Shandong, and Anhui Provinces, C. fructicola and C. siamense exhibited matched occurrences in strawberry fields. However, C. siamense predominated in strawberry fields of Hubei and Taiwan, where the climate is subtropical with higher annual average temperatures. Latitude and elevation in relation to temperature variations might influence the geographic distribution of Colletotrichum pathogens.
The vast majority of Colletotrichum fungi are not host-specific but adapt to a wide range of hosts. This broad adaptability presents challenges in managing Colletotrichum spp. and mitigating their destructive effects in agricultural production. A comparative analysis of host ranges can reflect the prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum spp. in strawberry fields. Of the five Colletotrichum complexes associated with strawberry, the number of species-host combinations by complex was 516, 295, 129, 58, and 37 for the C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. boninense, C. truncatium, and C. dematium complexes, respectively. Clearly, the host range of Colletotrichum species complexes is positively correlated with their prevalence in strawberry fields.
As the most prevalent pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose crown rot in the Asia-Pacific region, C. siamense and C. fructicola are the top two Colletotrichum species most frequently encountered worldwide. Both species are cosmopolitan fungi that adapt to a wide range of host plants, with a notable presence in tropical and subtropical regions, but significantly higher occurrences in Asia than in other continents. In vitro mating of fungal isolates demonstrated that C. fructicola is homothallic, whereas C. siamense is heterothallic, suggesting that C. siamense has a relatively higher capability for genetic mutations and flexibility, which aligns with its wider host spectrum compared to C. fructicola.
To provide practical information for strawberry anthracnose management, the host ranges of C. fructicola and C. siamense were updated through a search of fungal databases, resulting in a significantly wider range of hosts for these species than previously suggested in earlier publications. Accordingly, the host ranges of these two predominant pathogens were sorted based on their taxonomy.
A total of 314 and 358 plant host records were obtained for C. fructicola and C. siamense at the Fungal Database (July 8, 2022), respectively. Four additional host records of C. siamense, including Datura metel, Dieffenbachia spp. (Araceae), Pongamia pinnata (Fabaceae), and Viola odorata (Violaceae) (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021), which were missed in the Fungal Database, were included in the current analysis. Since some host records were not determined at a species level, we sorted these hosts at a genus level based on taxonomic analysis. C. siamense is associated with hosts from 111 genera, including one genus of gymnosperm (Cycas), 10 genera of basal angiosperms, 26 genera of monocots, and 74 genera of dicots. The top two orders of plants containing the most genera are Rosales and Malpighiales, each with nine genera, followed by Fabales (8), Sapindales (8), Lamiales (6), Malvales (6), Asparagales (6), and Alismatales (6). In contrast, C. fructicola is associated with hosts from 75 genera, which is a relatively smaller spectrum than that of C. siamense. No gymnosperm was recorded as a host for C. fructicola, and the top three plant orders hosting this species are Rosales (9 genera), Sapindales (7), and Caryophyllales (6). Records of plant hosts that are cross-infected or co-infected by multiple Colletotrichum species are not scarce. Indeed, the co-occurrence of C. fructicola and C. siamense has been simultaneously identified in the same strawberry production field in Shanghai. The combined host range of the two Colletotrichum species was expanded to 152 genera, including one gymnosperm, 12 angiosperms (six orders), 38 monocots (10 orders), and 101 dicots (22 orders). Among the combined hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense, Fabales, Sapindales, Rosales, and Asparagales are the top four orders, each consisting of 12, 12, 11, and 11 genera, respectively. Furthermore, there were plants from 34 genera in 19 orders recorded as shared hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense, including two genera of basal angiosperms (Annona and Persea), six monocots (Anthurium, Areca, Cymbopogon, Dioscorea, Musa, and Pennisetum), and 26 dicots. Notably, the common hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense include seven genera from the Rosales order: Fragaria, Malus, Pyrus, and Prunus of Rosaceae, as well as Artocarpus, Ficus, and Ziziphus.
C. fructicola were illustrated, providing a global evolutionary picture of all the plants (by genus) hosting the top two Colletotrichum species on Earth. The wide diffusion of C. siamense and C. fructicola hosts in the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms reinforces that they diverged very early, reasonably maintaining pathogenic strategies well established during coevolution with flowering plants.
In this work, we revisited the discovery history of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose and provided a global glimpse of the genetic diversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry. Currently, 23 species of Colletotrichum, clustered in five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been listed as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. Two species have been rejected as they turned out to be a confused citation (C. paranaense) or not pathogenic to strawberry (C. clidemiae). Notably, it has been suggested that about 30% of ITS sequences in open databases, including GenBank, are related to incorrect taxa of fungi such as the Colletotrichum genus. Thus, future identification and acceptance of novel species as causal agents of crop anthracnose should be performed rigorously, following the rules of both taxonomy and plant pathology, relying on not only multiple barcode genes but also whole genome sequencing.
Based on published data, we discussed the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in China. C. siamense and C. fructicola, part of C. gloeosporioides s.l., are currently the most prevalent. The host range of the predominant Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose crown rot includes various plant genera. Specifically, certain genera host both C. fructicola and C. siamense, while other genera exclusively host either species. The taxonomy of each host was determined through thorough evaluation, and the host composition is expressed as the percentage of hosts belonging to distinct phylogenetic clades at the genus level.
The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and dynamically changes in specific areas. In Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 but has not been detected since 2016. An early report showed that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected. However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan. Similar shifts have occurred in Korea. This variation in prevailing Colletotrichum species related to strawberries in several regions might be associated with global warming, changes in cultivation patterns from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation, and substitution of strawberry varieties. The wide application of raised
Fig. 4 The taxonomic positions of plants hosting Colletotrichum fructicola and/or C. siamense. Pie charts were generated with the number of host genera belonging to certain orders (retrieved from fungal databases and distinguished at a specific plant database during July 2022) listed in Additional file 1: Table S1. Red represents hosts of C. siamense, green for those of C. fructicola, and yellow for the common hosts shared by the two Colletotrichum species. A total of 38 orders were marked in the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms (68 orders) modified from Figure S1 of Li et al. (2021). The unique gymnosperm host of C. siamense is shown at the bottom right.
Beds in protected cultivation significantly increased the temperature for strawberry production. It has been revealed that Colletotrichum species, such as C. gloeosporioides s.l., displayed greater tolerance to high temperatures compared to C. acutatum s.l. (Han et al. 2016; Chung et al. 2020). Additionally, the prevalence of C. siamense and C. fructicola in China may be closely linked with the widespread cultivation of the highly susceptible cultivar Benihoppe, as a susceptible host imposes a strong and direct selection on pathogen populations (Chen et al. 2017). It is expected that the biodiversity of Colletotrichum associated with strawberry in China will change in the future with the gradually expanded cultivation of resistant or partially resistant cultivars such as Kanto seika, HongYu, YueXin, Tongzhou Princess, and Shanghai Fragrance in several provinces and regions. There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them with powerful adaptation capabilities (Gan et al. 2021).
In the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, composed of as many as 57 species, and is considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting more than 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, in Chinese strawberry fields belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. and are actually the two Colletotrichum species most frequently recorded globally, though with significantly more records in Asia than in other continent
The longest summer ever in Shanghai lasted 162 days in 2021 until mid-October, which is 52 days longer than the summer 60 years ago. This extended period of warmth contributed to a notable outbreak of several diseases, including anthracnose crown rot, which caused mortality in strawberry production fields after transplanting. It is tempting to speculate that global warming will exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, changes in temperature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the response of the specific “disease triangle” to these variations (Velásquez et al. 2018). In an era of anthropogenic habitat modification and climate change, mitigating the impacts of global warming on sustainable strawberry development is crucial. To meet this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones such as C. siamense and C. fructicola, in terms of their life cycle and pathogenesis.
For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, producing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, integrated with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, would be one of the most important objectives for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than adaptation to new climates in situ, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. This is coupled with frequent host jumps and transitions (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). In turn, shifts in host range facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Corredor-Moreno and Saunders 2020). The evolution and flexibility of temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum species contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, continuous attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.
The present study provided a comprehensive list of Colletotrichum species virulent to strawberries, along with the global diversity of these fungi and their occurrence data. This information will assist in establishing improved disease management practices and designing appropriate quarantine measures in strawberry trade. Understanding the relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species will guide studies on fungicide sensitivity and the strain- or species-specific susceptibility of strawberry varieties. Knowledge of pathogen host range can further aid in managing plant disease through crop rotation, intercropping, elimination of reservoirs such as weeds, quarantine measures, forecasting disease emergence, and risk assessment (Morris and Moury 2019). Since the predominant C. siamense and C. fructicola causing strawberry crown rot infect many economically important crops, this knowledge will have implications for agricultural practices beyond just strawberries.
