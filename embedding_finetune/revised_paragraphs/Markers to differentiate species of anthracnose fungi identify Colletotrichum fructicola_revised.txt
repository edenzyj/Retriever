Abstract
Colletotrichum fungi belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex include a number of economically important postharvest pathogens that often cause anthracnose. Until now, different species within this group could only be reliably distinguished from one another using multigenic phylogenetic analyses. Using a comparative genomics approach, we developed a marker that can differentiate Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum aenigma, and Colletotrichum siamense within the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on PCR amplicon size differences. When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing different species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberries in Japan and contributes to our understanding of the diversity of anthracnose pathogens in the country.

Introduction
Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, causing at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s. Anthracnose disease is a significant problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material. The presence of even one infected plant can lead to the infection of an entire field, underscoring the importance of early detection and classification. Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum can be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories. Several of these lineages have now been systematically classified as species complexes comprising closely related sibling species. Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range. Additionally, previous studies have shown that ITS sequences alone, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex. However, distinguishing between species within the same species complex is crucial, as different species may require different infection management strategies. For instance, while Colletotrichum kahawae is an aggressive pathogen of coffee, Colletotrichum asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense are opportunistic pathogens.
The nucleotide sequence data reported are available in the DDBJ/EMBL/GenBank databases under the accession numbers KU642469–KU642552, KX247845–KX247850, and KX513878–KX513929.

In Japan, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to C. gloeosporioides, and to our knowledge, there have not been studies to determine whether different members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex are associated with strawberry infections. Previous studies, however, indicated that even within Japan alone, infections are caused by strains that can be subdivided into genetically distinguishable groups. In this study, we found that at least three distinct species, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and Colletotrichum aenigma, were responsible for strawberry anthracnose disease in the Chiba Prefecture in Japan. Using genomic analyses, we designed a set of PCR markers that can distinguish these species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. With these markers, we identified isolates collected in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, between 1994 and 2014. Our data suggest that C. fructicola has been the predominant species in this region over the last two decades.
Materials and Methods
Isolation of anthracnose pathogens from infected strawberries involved using the term "isolate" to refer to a pure culture of a single sample from an infected plant; the term "strain" refers to a defined isolate that can be distinguished from other isolates using phylogenetic methods based on six combined loci (ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, TUB, and GAPDH). Isolates from the C. gloeosporioides species complex were collected from anthracnose lesions on strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) or randomly sampled latently infected strawberry plants from the Inba, Chiba, Kimitsu, Awa, Chosei, Sanbu, and Kaiso regions in Chiba Prefecture between 1994 and 2014. From latently infected plants, conidia were isolated using the ethanol immersion technique. These isolates were identified as members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex using the primer CgInt and the universal primer ITS4.
Comparative Genomic Analysis
Pairwise alignments of genome assemblies were conducted using the nucmer program with default settings. Conserved regions present in the genomes of C. fructicola, C. aenigma, and C. siamense were identified using the bedtools suite of programs. The sequences encompassing the marker regions have been deposited in GenBank. Nucleotide BLAST searches were carried out using the nucleotide sequences between the predicted primer binding sites as queries against specific individual genome assemblies in CLC Genomics Workbench.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Sequences from actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate (GAPDH), β-tubulin 2 (TUB), and the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) were amplified from isolates using primers listed from fungal DNA extracted using the DNeasy kit. PCR reactions were set up with a PCR mix, including forward and reverse primers, and purified fungal DNA. DNA sequences from these isolates have been deposited in GenBank. PCR was conducted with specified temperature and cycling conditions. The DNA sequences obtained were aligned with sequences of previously classified isolates.
The sequences were aligned using the MAFFT program (version 7.215; Katoh et al. 2002) and trimmed with the trimAl program (version 1.2rev59; Capella-Gutiérrez et al. 2009) using the automated settings. This process resulted in an alignment consisting of 2854 positions, which were partitioned according to genes for phylogenetic tree analysis. Maximum likelihood analysis was conducted using RAxML (version 8.2.4; Stamatakis 2014), while Bayesian inference analysis was performed using MrBayes (version 3.2.6; Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). The PartitionFinder program (version 1.1.1; Lanfear et al. 2012) was employed to determine the optimal nucleotide substitution models for each partition based on the BIC criteria. Both RAxML and MrBayes analyses utilized the GTRGAMMA model for each partition, allowing for different evolutionary rates. MrBayes was executed twice for 20,000,000 generations, sampling every 1000 generations and discarding the first 25% as burn-in. The resulting trees were visualized using FigTree (version 1.4.2). Sequences from Colletotrichum boninsense (Weir et al. 2012) were included as an outgroup.
PCR reactions were performed using extracted fungal DNA and the Marker 1 and Marker 2 primer pairs for 30 cycles at 95 °C for 1 minute, 55 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 30 seconds, followed by a final extension step at 72 °C for 5 minutes before separation in a 1% agarose gel. Specific primers for virulent strains (Suzuki et al. 2008) were utilized to differentiate between virulent and less virulent isolates.
The genomes of three strains isolated from infected strawberry plants—Cg38 (from Chiba), Cg56 (from Tochigi), and Cg363 (from Chiba)—were sequenced and classified using multigenic phylogenetic analysis of ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, GAPDH, and TUB sequences. In the multigenic phylogenetic trees, the three strains were categorized into distinct species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex: C. fructicola (Cg38), C. aenigma (Cg56), and C. siamense (Cg363). The Cg38 strain was closely related to the previously sequenced C. fructicola Nara gc5 (Gan et al. 2013) and served as a reference strain for subsequent analyses. Pairwise alignments of the genome assemblies were conducted using the C. fructicola (Cg38) assembly as a reference. A total of 5987 genomic regions were identified through nucmer analysis, comprising 6.35 Mb of sequence present in the reference strain but not conserved in the C. siamense and C. aenigma assemblies. Among these, 2203 genomic regions were specific to the reference C. fructicola strain. The remaining 3784 regions included 3110 unconserved regions flanked by at least 2 kb of sequence in the reference strain. Among these 3110 unconserved regions, 1025 target regions ranged from 200 bp to 1 kb in size. To design primers, it was essential to identify target regions surrounded by highly conserved regions. Sequences from these 1025 target regions were analyzed for overlap with 6153 genomic regions conserved among the three mentioned strains, leading to the identification o
Primers were tested on a number of isolates that were classified based on phylogenetic trees constructed using ACT, CAL, CHS-1, ITS, TUB, and GAPDH sequences. These sequences included those from members of the previously classified C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012).
In the C. fructicola genome, the region targeted by Marker 1 was found to overlap with the CGGC5_05943 gene, which encodes a hypothetical protein. The protein encoded by CGGC5_05943 is conserved in the genomes of strains outside of the C. gloeosporioides species complex, such as C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, C. orbiculare, C. sublinoleola, and C. fioriniae. However, there is sufficient divergence at the nucleotide level to distinguish these sequences.

C. queenslandicum ICMP18705 showed various results across multiple metrics, with scores of 93, 61, 100, 94, 79, 96, 92, 7, 68, 39, 4, 47, 73, 100, 8, 96, 38, 99, 52, 81, 87, 93, 41, 89, 84, 100, 75, 27, 100, 14, 42, 70, 33, 54, 50, 100, 100, 87, 17, 97, 56, 64, 91, 100, 74, 99, 75, 14, 76, 23, 96, 100, 54, 95, 63, 100, 85, 17, 99, 97, 50, 77, 57, 47, 71, 98, 100, 96, 66, 83, 67, 99, 100, 6, 100, 78, 77, 59, 98, 96, 83, 59, 84, 83, 76, 52, 54, 69, 97, 46, 14, 15, 27, 98, 32, 51, 0.04.
The results of the region amplified by Marker 1 were compared to other Colletotrichum genome sequences, including C. higginsianum, C. graminicola, C. incanum, C. orbiculare, C. fructicola, C. sublineola, C. fioriniae, and C. gloeosporioides, showing that the amplified region was specific to C. fructicola, C. aenigma, and C. siamense. According to BLAST analysis (cutoff E-value = 1E-5), the sequence was absent in the genome assembly of the closely related C. gloeosporioides strain. In PCR reactions, Marker 1 amplified a single band from various C. gloeosporioides species complex members, including C. kahawae strains. Marker 2 PCR showed amplification of bands: approximately 1 kb from Cg38 (C. fructicola), 550 bp in Cg363 (C. siamense), and 300 bp from Cg56 (C. aenigma). The locus containing Marker 2 is in an intergenic region, suggesting that while the primer binding regions are specific, they flank a potential repeat region. To confirm the correlation between different PCR amplicon sizes and species, at least five isolates from each pattern were classified using multilocus phylogenetic trees drawn with Bayesian and maximum likelihood methods. Both methods produced consistent tree topologies.
Cg192, Cg231, Cg255, Cg131, and NK24, which showed a 550 bp amplicon, were classified as C. siamense based on the multilocus phylogenetic trees. Additionally, amplicons of 300 bp were amplified from the DNA of Cg111, Cg112, Cg132, Cg191, and NK18, which clustered with known strains identified as C. aenigma. The four isolates that did not show amplification with Marker 2 but could be amplified by Marker 1 were classified as C. kahawae. The lack of PCR products indicates that the region amplified by Marker 2 may be specific to members within the Musae subclade in the C. gloeosporioides species complex.

In recent years, the need to reclassify plant pathogens such as Colletotrichum using molecular-based techniques has been recognized because previous classifications based on morphology and host range have been found to be likely incorrect or less definitive. Studies to characterize which specific species are associated with infections are important since different species may be associated with different infection outcomes in the field, as mentioned for coffee anthracnose. Unconserved regions in C. aenigma and C. siamense, but present in reference C. fructicola, are not on reference-specific scaffolds or contigs. These unconserved regions are flanked by ≥2 kb reference sequences, with sizes ranging from 200 bp to 1 kb. The flanking region overlaps with sequences conserved in C. aenigma, C. siamense, and C. fructicola. A total of 5987 potential marker regions were identified, with 3784 regions, 3110 regions, 1025 regions, and 1365 flanking regions noted.
To divide strains into different groups, other studies have utilized random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphisms, internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length (ITS-RFLP) polymorphisms, or classification by ITS sequences. While RAPD and ITS-RFLP polymorphisms indicate genetic variability among isolates, specific polymorphisms have not yet been associated with specific species. Furthermore, classifying strains using a single marker sequence has been found to be insufficient to distinguish strains belonging to different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Using a comparative genomics strategy, researchers successfully developed a single marker to distinguish among three species.
Amplification of bands from DNA of fungal isolates from the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex was demonstrated using two markers. Marker 1 amplified bands from all C. gloeosporioides strains tested, while Marker 2 distinguished between C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. aenigma based on amplicon size. Actin sequences were amplified as a control.
Strains used to test Marker 2 were isolated from different prefectures over several years. For example, isolate Cg38 was isolated in 1994 from Awa, and the presence or absence of symptoms such as leaf wilt or spot is indicated for each strain. The isolates show variability in their origins and symptoms over the years, with data highlighting their distribution from 1994 to 2014.
Overall, the presence of C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. kahawae, and C. aenigma was documented in a range of isolates, reflecting the diversity and complexity of this species complex across the different years.
Fig. 5 illustrates the numbers and types of virulent (a) and less virulent (b) isolates of Colletotrichum from the field by year. In a study published in the Journal of General Plant Pathology, common pathogens of strawberry were identified as C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. aenigma. The described marker flanks a short repeat that is expanded in C. fructicola compared to C. siamense and C. aenigma. It is likely that this sequence was gained or expanded in C. fructicola because it was absent in closely related C. kahawae strains. The comparative genomics method utilized in this study is a practical strategy that can be further applied to develop markers for distinguishing traits or species differences.
The multilocus phylogenetic analysis of 20 isolates from Japan indicated that these isolates tended to group with one another within each species, suggesting a single introduction of the different species into the field rather than multiple introductions. This finding, while perhaps unsurprising given the restricted geographical region of the isolates, remains to be confirmed with further phylogenetic analyses since this analysis was limited to only 20 isolates.
From the analysis of isolates collected in Chiba Prefecture over 20 years, it was shown that at least four species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex can infect strawberry plants in the field. This mirrors previous findings on mango anthracnose, which had been attributed to C. gloeosporioides infections. Recent studies have revealed that mango anthracnose is caused by various species belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, including C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. tropicale, C. karstii, and C. dianesei.
Different species also contribute to strawberry anthracnose infections. Recent studies have identified various species of the C. gloeosporioides species complex associated with strawberry plants, such as C. fructicola in the United States, C. fructicola in Korea, and C. murrayae, C. gloeosporioides, C. fructicola, and C. aenigma in China. In our study, we found that species from both the Musae and, to a lesser extent, the Kahawae clades can infect strawberries in Japan. Although C. fructicola was identified as the predominant virulent species in the field, both virulent and less virulent isolates of C. fructicola and C. siamense were identified, indicating that specific species are not strictly correlated with virulence on strawberry plants, in contrast to observations made for coffee anthracnose.
The identification of multiple species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberry plants highlights the diversity of strawberry anthracnose pathogens, suggesting that this population of pathogens can adapt to changing conditions, which may inform disease management strategies.

Markers to differentiate species of anthracnose fungi identify Colletotrichum fructicola as the predominant virulent species in strawberry plants in Chiba Prefecture of Japan.
Abstract
Introduction
Materials and Methods
Isolation of anthracnose pathogens from infected strawberry plants was conducted. A comparative genomic analysis was performed, followed by a phylogenetic analysis to determine relationships among the isolates. Genotyping of isolates was carried out to assess genetic diversity.
Results
The marker region identification process revealed two significant markers. The tests for Marker 1 and Marker 2 were conducted, showing clear distinctions among the isolates. Genotyping of isolates from Chiba Prefecture between 1994 and 2014 highlighted trends in virulence and pathogen evolution.
Discussion
The findings suggest a predominance of Colletotrichum fructicola in the region, which could have implications for strawberry cultivation practices.
