Colletotrichum species associated with mango in southern China
Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is an economically significant fruit crop in provinces of southern China, including Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Fujian. The objective of this study was to examine the diversity of Colletotrichum species infecting mango cultivars in major growing areas in China, using morphological and molecular techniques along with pathogenicity tests on detached leaves and fruits. Over 200 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained across all mango orchards investigated, and 128 of them were selected for sequencing and analysis of actin (ACT), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, and β-tubulin (TUB2) genomic regions. Our results showed that the most common fungal isolates associated with mango in southern China involved 13 species: Colletotrichum asianum, C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. The dominant species were C. asianum and C. siamense, each accounting for 30%, and C. fructicola for 25%. Only C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. scovillei, and C. siamense have previously been reported on mango, while the other nine Colletotrichum species listed above are reported for the first time in association with mango in China. From this study, five Colletotrichum species, namely C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. liaoningense, and C. musae, are reported for the first time on mango worldwide. Pathogenicity tests revealed that all 13 species caused symptoms on artificially wounded mango fruit and leaves (cv. Tainong). There was no obvious relationship between aggressiveness and the geographic origin of the isolates. These findings will aid in mango disease management and future disease resistance breeding.
Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is one of the most economically important fruit crops worldwide, and after India, China is the second-largest mango producer. The planted area of mango in China was approximately 173,000 hectares, with a total production of 1,437,700 tons on the mainland in 2014. Major mango-producing areas in China include Guangdong, Guangxi, Guizhou, Fujian, Hainan, Yunnan, and Sichuan provinces. Mango anthracnose, caused by several Colletotrichum species, is considered the most important disease affecting mango in China. Annually, mango anthracnose can account for about 30–60% loss of production, and the damage could reach 100% under optimum conditions for the pathogen. Traditionally, Colletotrichum species are identified based on morphological characteristics, including conidial and appressorial size and shape, presence of acervuli, setae, or sclerotia, sexual structures, and cultural characteristics such as growth rate a
Studies on Colletotrichum have classified the genus into nine major clades plus isolated species or small clusters, with clades probably representing species complexes. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA has frequently been used to separate Colletotrichum species, but sometimes the ITS sequence information alone was not sufficient to clarify species boundaries within the genus. Thus, other genes, including ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, and TUB2, have been used to resolve relationships among many fungi, including Colletotrichum species. A multiple evidence approach, using combined molecular sequencing information and morphological data, is now recommended as an alternative method for accurate species identification in the genus Colletotrichum.
Colletotrichum species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. amagnum, C. aorchidearum, C. boninense, C. dracaenophilum, and C. gloeosporioides have been separated into many different species using both morphological and molecular techniques. However, in China, the identification of Colletotrichum species on mango has relied mainly on conidial morphology and ITS sequences, and the combined data have been limited and insufficient to distinguish closely related taxa in the six species complexes mentioned above. Previous research regarding Colletotrichum species on mango mostly involved samples from small and fragmented provincial areas, resulting in poor representation of the actual species diversity in the vast mango-growing regions in China.
In our previous study, three Colletotrichum species causing mango anthracnose in Guangxi province in China (C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense) were reported. However, the growing season and harvesting time of mango in seven provinces vary in environmental conditions, climatic factors, and varieties grown, which may lead to variations in the composition and distribution of causal agents of mango anthracnose. Genetic diversity is often related to evolutionary potential and the ability to adapt to variable environmental conditions. Based on our current understanding of the gene-for-gene hypothesis, resistance genes lose their effectiveness when faced with complex and evolving pathogen populations. An understanding of the population structure and species distribution of pathogens can provide insights into optimal breeding strategies for durable resistance to anthracnose in mangoes and improved cultural controls.
The objectives of this study were as follows: (1) to identify Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose symptoms in six provinces of China using cultural characteristics such as conidial and appressorial morphology, as well as multilocus sequencing data for phylogenetic analyses; (2) to test the aggressiveness of isolates from different geographic locations in the major mango-growing areas in mainland China; and (3) to examine the variation of isolates within and between regions.
In 2016 and 2017, all the leaves, fruits, and branches of mango with anthracnose symptoms collected from six mango-growing provinces in China were used for fungal isolation. Based on morphological observation and ITS sequences, a total of 205 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from all the investigated mango-growing regions, and 128 representative isolates were selected for further study (one isolate from each orchard, and more than one from some larger orchards; 34 from Yunnan, 23 from Hainan, 18 from Guizhou, 13 from Sichuan, 16 from Guangdong, and 24 from Fujian province). The selected isolates are detailed in Supplementary Table S1. Isolated species in other genera include Alternaria, Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria, and Pestalotia, which were retained for further study.
For phylogenetic analyses, these isolates from different areas were used for sequencing and analyses of the ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, and TUB2 loci. All sequences were first compared with the NR database from NCBI-GenBank using BLASTn and then submitted to GenBank (see Supplementary Table S1). For phylogenetic analysis, sequences of ex-type or ex-epitype strains of Colletotrichum species (Supplementary Table S2) were selected. According to the ILD test, the partitions of the data into ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB2 were homogeneous, and the datasets were combined for Maximum Likelihood (ML) and Bayesian analyses. For the Bayesian analyses, a JC model was selected for ACT, a GTR + I + G model for GAPDH, ITS, and CHS-1, and a HKY + G model for TUB2, which were incorporated into the analysis. Concatenated sequences from the five loci (ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS) were generated for each of the 128 Colletotrichum isolates, plus ex-type or type strains downloaded from GenBank to generate a phylogenetic tree (Fig. 1). The topology of the Bayesian analysis of the combined dataset was nearly identical to that of the ML consensus tree; therefore, only the Bayesian tree is shown, with bootstrap (from ML analysis) on the left and posterior probability (from Bayesian analysis) on the right of corresponding nodes (Fig. 1). The results showed that 38 isolates clustered with four C. asianum strains (ICMP 18605, ICMP 18603, IMI 313839, and ICMP 18580), showing 100% posterior probability (PP) and bootstrap (BS); 38 isolates were aligned with five C. siamense strains (with 100% posterior probability and 95% bootstrap); and 32 isolates were placed with two C. fructicola strains (ICMP 18727 and ICMP 18613) and one C. ignotum strain (CBS125397), supported by 100% posterior probability and 90% bootstrap. Five isolates clustered with strains of C. karstii (CB
Conidia were all hyaline, aseptate, and long elliptic to cylindrical. The average conidial sizes varied among species. For isolates grown on PDA, the length of conidia for each isolate varied from 6.99 μm to 29.22 μm, and the width of conidia varied from 2.99 μm to 9.85 μm. The mean conidial length and width ranged from 11.5 μm to 25.5 μm and 4.0 μm to 8.2 μm. The conidial morphology of Colletotrichum species on mango differed significantly between and within species. For example, C. fructicola (GZ15-1) had profuse sporulation, C. gigasporum (HN42-2) produced the largest spores, and the shortest spores were generated by C. scovillei (YN51-1).
The data presented indicates various Colletotrichum species with their corresponding identifiers, confidence scores, and relationships. For example, several isolates of C. siamense, including ICMP 18578 and ICMP 17795, showed high confidence scores of 100/1 and 95/1 respectively. C. fructicola was notably mentioned multiple times with various isolates, exhibiting diverse confidence levels, such as ICMP 18613 and ICMP 18727. Other species like C. gloeosporioide, C. kahawae, and C. scovillei also appeared with varying confidence scores, reflecting their distinct morphological characteristics and classifications. The diversity within the Colletotrichum species is evident, highlighting the significance of their identification in relation to their morphological traits.
C. cliviicola, CSSK4, showed values of 100/1 and 99/1. Monilochaetes infuscans had values of CBS 869.96*, 93/1, and 72/1. Other species included C. musae, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, C. gloeosporioides, C. endophytica, C. karstii, C. cordylinicola, C. scovillei, C. liaoningense, C. gigasporum, and C. tropicale.
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences from 128 Colletotrichum isolates, including extype or ex-epitype isolates in GenBank, based on combined ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, and CHS-1 genomic data. The numbers on the left and right of each node represent posterior probabilities estimated using MrBayes v. 3.2.6 and bootstrap values from RAxMLGUI v. 1.3.1, respectively.
Conidial appressoria were grey cloud (#B6B6B4) to black (#000000), nearly elliptical or irregular. The length of appressoria for each species varied from 4.9 μm to 14.9 μm, with widths ranging from 3.6 μm to 10.6 μm. The mean length and width calculated for each isolate ranged from 6.4 μm to 12.4 μm.
Mycelial appressoria were pale brown to dark brown, rod-shaped, occasionally irregular. The length of appressoria for each species varied from 5.6 μm to 20.7 μm, with widths ranging from 3.5 μm to 15.4 μm.
Morphological characteristics of colonies, conidia, and appressoria of mango Colletotrichum isolates from China were documented. Upper sides of various isolates were observed on PDA plates 14 days after inoculation, while conidia were examined on PDA plates after 14 days at 25 °C. Conidial appressoria were assessed on glass slides after 3 days at 25 °C, and mycelial appressoria on cover slips after 7 days at the same temperature. The bars for all measurements indicated a scale of 10 μm.
The mean values of length and width calculated for each isolate ranged from 7.6 μm to 15.0 μm and 5.5 μm to 12.2 μm, respectively.

The morphological characteristics of the colonies, conidia, and appressoria of mango Colletotrichum isolates from China include various species observed on PDA plates after 14 days at 25 °C. The isolates displayed different features on glass slides after 3 days at 25 °C and on cover slips after 7 days at 25 °C, with the conidial and mycelial appressoria being examined in detail. The bars represent a scale of 10 μm.
The mean value of length and width calculated for each isolate ranged from 7.6 μm to 15.0 μm and 5.5 μm to 12.2 μm, respectively.
The various Colletotrichum species reported here showed differences in both conidial and appressorial sizes and growth rates. Based on morphological observation and multi-loci sequence analysis, 128 mango Colletotrichum isolates obtained in China can be classified into 13 species as follows: 38 isolates (29.7%) of C. asianum, 38 isolates (29.7%) of C. siamense, 32 isolates (25.0%) of C. fructicola, five isolates of C. karstii (3.9%), four isolates of C. endophytica (3.1%), three isolates of C. scovillei (2.3%), two isolates of C. cliviicola (1.6%), and one isolate for each of the following species: C. cordylinicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. liaoningense, C. musae, and C. tropicale. This is the first report for C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, and C. tropicale associated with mango anthracnose in China. This is also the first report for C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. liaoningense, and C. musae associated with mango anthracnose worldwide.
The diversity of species and geographical distribution of various Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose across different provinces in China are notable. Hainan and Yunnan had the most abundant and diverse Colletotrichum species on mango. Nine Colletotrichum species (C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. gigasporum, C. karstii, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale) were recovered from mango with anthracnose symptoms in Hainan province, while eight species (C. asianum, C. cliviicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. scovillei, and C. siamense) were obtained from mango in Yunnan. Four species (C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, and C. musae) were associated with mango anthracnose in Guizhou province. Only two Colletotrichum species (C. asianum and C. siamense) were isolated in Sichuan and Guangdong provinces. C. asianum and C. fructicola were found in Fujian province. Overall, C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. si
Isolates exhibited varying sizes of conidial and mycelial appressoria. The mean size of conidial appressoria ranged from 6.38 ± 0.27 μm in C. scovillei to 12.41 ± 0.41 μm in C. gigasporum, while mycelial appressoria sizes varied from 4.91 ± 0.19 μm in C. scovillei to 12.21 ± 0.34 μm in C. gigasporum. The study involved 13 species of Colletotrichum isolated from mango across six provinces in China. The length and width of 30 conidial and mycelial appressoria per isolate were measured on glass and plastic slides after 3 and 7 days at 25 °C, respectively.
Discussion
In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy and molecular classification based on ITS sequences, along with the presence of secondary metabolites and other traits. However, these methods, whether used alone or in combination, were often insufficient for fully resolving the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including various morphological aspects and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species. Based on morphological characteristics and a concatenated five-gene phylogenetic analysis, 128 Colletotrichum isolates from mango in southern China were classified into 13 species: C. asianum, C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. Additionally, four species complexes—C. acutatum, C. boninense, C. gigasporum, and C. gloeosporioides—were found to be associated with mango. The morphological descriptions of the isolates aligned with previous descriptions of Colletotrichum species, although cultural characteristics may vary due to different cultural conditions, and conidial morphology alone was insufficient to differentiate all species within the complexes.
Currently, thirteen Colletotrichum species have been reported worldwide on mango: C. asianum, C. cliviicola, C. dianesei, C. endomangiferae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. grossum, C. kahawae, C. karstii, C. scovillei, C. siamense, C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae), and C. tropicale. Mo et al., Liu et al., and Qin et al. identified four prevalent species on mango in China: C. asianum, C. fructicola, C
The present study revealed high diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with mango from the six major mango-growing areas in China. The Colletotrichum isolates examined also showed high diversity, which may correlate with varying environmental conditions such as temperature and rainfall, as well as the sample collection time and isolate source. Colletotrichum asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense were identified as the major species associated with mango anthracnose in China. This finding aligns with what was reported by Vieira et al. (2014), who found that C. asianum was the most common endophytic species from mango trees. Both Colletotrichum asianum and C. siamense have been reported as pathogens of a wide range of hosts, including Coffea arabica, Carica papaya, and Mangifera indica. Our study demonstrated that a single host species can be attacked by multiple Colletotrichum species, a phenomenon previously noted by Phoulivong et al. Colletotrichum fructicola was initially reported on coffee berries and has a broad host range, including Arachis species, Citrus bergamia, and Mangifera indica, along with wide geographical distribution. Similarly, C. tropicale has been reported on Annona muricata, Viola surinamensis, and Mangifera indica in Brazil. Colletotrichum musae is a major causal agent of banana anthracnose, associated with fruit disease spots in Musa species across many countries. Colletotrichum cliviicola was found to be linked to anthracnose of Clivia miniata and Cymbidium hookerianum in China, as well as Phaseolus and Saccharum species in India. It has also been documented as an endophyte in Mangifera indica in Brazil. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is recognized as a primary pathogen of Citrus species, Mangifera species, and Vitis vinifera among many other host species, being considered a species complex. This study identified C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. musae, C. siamense, and C. tropicale, which can all be classified within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, consistent with prior reports highlighting this complex as a predominant group associated with mango anthracnose. Colletotrichum scovillei has been reported as a pathogen on mango and Capsicum species (chili “Django”) and is categorized within the C. acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum karstii was first documented from orchids and has also been identified on other hosts such as Carica papaya, Citrus species, and Mangifera indica. This species has been found on mango and avocado fruit and is placed in the C. boninense species complex. Colletotrichum gigasporum belongs to the C. gigasporum species complex and has large conidia, with a wide range of hosts including Acacia auriculiformis and Coffea species in Vietnam, as well as Diospyros kaki and Musa species in Japan. Colletotrichum endophytica was found on Pennisetum purpureum in Thailand and tea plants in China. Colletotrichum liaoningense was first reported as a pathogen of Capsicu
Pathogenicity tests using thirteen species of Colletotrichum isolates showed that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits in the wound-inoculation experiment. The tests indicated that the aggressiveness of Colletotrichum species on fruit was not completely consistent with that on leaves, but significant differences in aggressiveness among different isolates were observed. The variation in aggressiveness within species was independent of a specific geographical origin for sample collection and may result from adaptations to the geographic and environmental origins of the isolates. However, more isolates from Yunnan province exhibited weak aggressiveness compared to those from Hainan province. Symptoms may vary considerably based on factors such as cultivar, fruit physiological state, inoculum concentration, and environmental conditions like humidity and temperature. Therefore, the pathogenicity test results from this study may not fully represent the aggressiveness potential of the examined isolates. Additional research is needed to assess the aggressiveness of Colletotrichum species using conidial inoculation in planta rather than wounded detached leaves and fruits with mycelial plugs. This study has enhanced our understanding of the diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose in China. Further research is required to investigate the differences in biological and infection characteristics among various mango Colletotrichum species, as well as the molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences and their effects on mango anthracnose disease in the field. There have been few studies on the etiology and epidemiology of Colletotrichum species on mango. Therefore, future work on pathogenic mechanisms could aid in the prevention and control of mango anthracnose disease.
Materials and Methods: Collection of samples and isolation of fungi. During 2016 and 2017, mango leaves, fruits, and branches with symptoms or signs of anthracnose were gathered from six provinces (Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan, Sichuan, and Yunnan) in China, covering an area of 1950 km by 800 km. Mango orchards were sampled with a minimum of 2 km distance between samples. Lesion margins on mango leaves, branches, and fruits were cut into 3 mm × 3 mm pieces, surface sterilized with ethanol (75%) for 15 seconds, and sodium hypochlorite (1% vol/vol) for 2 minutes, followed by three rinses in autoclaved distilled water for 30 seconds. The isolated fungi were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and kept at 25 °C. Over two weeks, the cultures were examined daily. Isolates were placed on PDA slants for long-term storage at 4 °C in the dark.
Morphological characterization. Before morphological examination, isolates were cultured under continuous fluorescent light on PDA for one week at 25 °C. Mycelial plugs (5 mm in diameter) were cut from colony margins and placed in 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes, with four plates per isolate. The colony characteristics (color of upper and lower surfaces) and growth rate (diameters in two perpendicular directions) were recorded after 3, 5, 7, and 10 days. Hyphal growth rate (cm/day) was calculated based on colony diameter. Conidial production, shape, and the size of conidia were examined up to three weeks on PDA incubated at 25 °C. Conidia (120 per isolate) from three-week-old PDA cultures were measured for length and width. Appressoria were produced from conidia placed on glass slides inside moist chambers. Appressoria were also produced from hyphae using a slide culture technique described by Cai et al. PDA plugs (1 cm × 1 cm) were placed in clean Petri dishes, and each agar plug was treated with conidia, with a cover slip placed over each plug. After 7 days, the shape and size of the appressoria were recorded. For each isolate, at least 30 appressoria were examined, and photographs were taken under a Nikon Eclipse Ni-E microscope.
DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing. Isolates were incubated at 25 °C on PDA in Petri plates overlaid with cellophane. After 7 days of growth, mycelia were harvested by scraping the cellophane with autoclaved spatulas, and DNA was extracted using a CTAB method. DNA was amplified with primers for partial actin (ACT), partial chitin synthase (CHS-1), partial glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), rDNA-ITS (ITS), and partial β-tubulin (TUB2) genomic regions. PCR amplification of ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and ITS was done with the primer pairs shown in the supplementary table. PCR amplifications were performed in 50-μl volumes containing 4 mM MgCl2, 1× PCR buffer, 0.5 units Taq DNA polymerase (Takara), 0.2 mM concentrations of each dNTP, 0.5 μM concentrations of each primer, and 1 μl of template DNA (20 ng/μl). The PCR programs for ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB2 were set according to Mo et al. The PCR
Mo et al. selected isolates for pathogenicity and aggressiveness tests on detached leaves and fruits of mango (cv. Tainong) under controlled conditions. Each isolate was incubated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 7–10 days at 25 °C. Freshly harvested mango fruits and young leaves without visible disease from Tiandong (Guangxi province) were used for the tests. The tissues were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 seconds and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute, followed by three rinses in autoclaved distilled water. After air drying, detached young healthy leaves (12–15 cm) were placed into plastic containers (9 cm × 17 cm × 25 cm) lined with paper toweling, and six stab wounds were made to form a 5-mm diameter circle. Mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) from the margins of PDA cultures were placed on each wound. The trial was completely randomized with three replicates per isolate. For controls, sterile agar plugs were used. The containers were sealed and incubated in the dark at 25 °C. Aggressiveness was assessed one week after inoculation by measuring lesion diameter. After washing and air drying, newly ripened mango fruits (approximately 100 g) were wounded by stabbing to a depth of 3 mm to form a 5-mm diameter circle. Mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) from PDA cultures were placed on the wounds, with sterile agar plugs serving as control treatments. Inoculated fruits were placed in plastic containers on top of moist paper toweling and sealed. The containers were placed in a growth chamber and incubated at 25 °C in the dark. Symptoms of the fruits were checked daily for up to 10 days. Isolates were considered pathogenic when lesions expanded beyond the 5 mm circle of the initial wounding. Aggressiveness was evaluated 10 days after inoculation by measuring lesion diameter. Statistical analyses were performed using Data Processing System software (DPS 7.0) for Windows (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China), and data were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA) followed by Fisher’s Least Significant Difference (LSD) tests for means separation.

Colletotrichum species associated with mango in southern China
Results: Fungal isolations, phylogenetic analyses, morphological observations, provincial geographic distribution of Colletotrichum species on mango in China, pathogenicity, and aggressiveness in tissues.
Discussion: Materials and Methods include the collection of samples and isolation of fungi, morphological characterization, DNA extraction, polymerase chain reaction (PCR) and sequencing, phylogenetic analyses, pathogenicity, and aggressiveness on mango tissues, and statistical analyses.
Acknowledgements:
The phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences of 128 Colletotrichum isolates, extype or ex-epitype isolates in the GenBank, based on combined ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, and CHS-1 genomic data. Morphological characteristics of colonies, conidia, and appressoria of mango Colletotrichum isolates from China were observed. The percentage of dominant Colletotrichum species on mango isolated from Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, Guizhou, Guangdong, and Fujian provinces in China was documented with the number of isolates from each province.
A detailed description of the appressorial size for 13 Colletotrichum species from mango collected from six provinces in China is provided, indicating the varying dimensions observed across different species and locations.
