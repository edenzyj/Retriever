INTRODUCTION
Colletotrichum species are important plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes, and can infect numerous plant hosts (Cannon et al. 2012, Dean et al. 2012, Diao et al. 2017, Guarnaccia et al. 2017). In recent years, the Colletotrichum species isolated from many host plants, e.g., Camellia sinensis (Theaceae), Capsicum annuum (Solanaceae), Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae), Mangifera indica (Anacardiaceae), and Vitis vinifera (Vitaceae), have been studied at a broad geographical level, contributing to a better understanding of the genus (Huang et al. 2013, Lima et al. 2013, Vieira et al. 2014, Liu et al. 2015, Yan et al. 2015, Diao et al. 2017, Guarnaccia et al. 2017). Although Pyrus is an important host genus for Colletotrichum spp., the Colletotrichum spp. associated with pear anthracnose remained largely unresolved, with only six individual species identified including C. acutatum, C. aenigma, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. pyricola, and C. salicis (Damm et al. 2012b, Weir et al. 2012). Moreover, previous reports chiefly investigated morphology and ITS sequence data (Wu et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2013b), which are insufficient for distinguishing closely related taxa in several species complexes (Liu et al. 2016a). Additionally, most of the species reported from pear were based on small sample sizes from restricted areas, thus underestimating the species diversity on this host (Damm et al. 2012b, Weir et al. 2012).
In the genus Pyrus, P. bretschneideri, P. communis, P. pyrifolia, P. sinkiangensis, and P. ussuriensis are commercially cultivated (Wu et al. 2013). Of these, P. bretschneideri, P. communis, and P. pyrifolia represent the major cultivated species in China (Zhao et al. 2016). Pear is the third most widespread temperate fruit crop after apple and grape, with the largest production in China (Wu et al. 2013). The pear industry is also one of the most important fruit industries worldwide. Statistical data for 2016 indicated that pear cultivation area was 1,121,675 ha, yielding 19.5 MT fruit in China, accounting for 70% of the global pear fruit yield (FAO 2016). Furthermore, Pyrus originated from the tertiary period (about 65 to 55 Myr ago) in western China, which represents one of the two subcenters for genetic diversity of this genus (Rubtsov 1944, Vavilov 1951, Zeven & Zhukovsky 1975, Wu et al. 2013, Silva et al. 2014).
Characterization of the Colletotrichum spp. associated with Pyrus plants is expected to provide better insight into the biology of this important genus. Moreover, pear anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is an important disease in major pear cultivation areas of China, occurring during the growth and fruit maturation periods of pear, mainly damaging leaves and fruits. Pear anthracnose has led to substantial economic

Abstract: Colletotrichum species are plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes on a range of economically important hosts. However, the species occurring on pear remain largely unresolved. To determine the morphology, phylogeny, and biology of Colletotrichum species associated with Pyrus plants, a total of 295 samples were collected from cultivated pear species (including P. pyrifolia, P. bretschneideri, and P. communis) from seven major pear cultivation provinces in China. Pear leaves and fruits affected by anthracnose were sampled and subjected to fungus isolation, resulting in a total of 488 Colletotrichum isolates. Phylogenetic analyses based on six loci (ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS), coupled with the morphology of 90 representative isolates, revealed that they belong to 10 known Colletotrichum species, including C. aenigma, C. citricola, C. conoides, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, C. wuxiense, and two novel species, described here as C. jinshuiense and C. pyrifoliae. Of these, C. fructicola was the most dominant, occurring on P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri in all surveyed provinces except in Shandong, where C. siamense was dominant. In contrast, only C. siamense and C. fioriniae were isolated from P. communis, with the former being dominant. In order to prove Koch’s postulates, pathogenicity tests on pear leaves and fruits revealed a broad diversity in pathogenicity and aggressiveness among the species and isolates, of which C. citricola, C. jinshuiense, C. pyrifoliae, and C. conoides appeared to be organ-specific on either leaves or fruits. This study also represents the first reports of C. citricola, C. conoides, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense causing anthracnose on pear.

3M. Fuetal.: Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of Pyrus spp. affecting pear production has been lacking in China and is also poorly documented worldwide. The taxonomy of the genus Colletotrichum has, in the past, mainly relied on host range and morphological characters (Von Arx 1957, Sutton 1980), which is limited in species resolution (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Recently, multi-locus phylogenetic analyses together with morphological characteristics have significantly influenced the classification and species concepts in Colletotrichum (Cai et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012, Damme et al. 2012a,b, 2013, 2014, 2019, Weir et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2013a, 2014, Vieira et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015, Guarnaccia et al. 2017). Phylogenetic analyses based on multi-locus DNA sequence data and the application of Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) represent an enhanced ability for species resolution (Quaedvlieg et al. 2014, Liu et al. 2016a, Diao et al. 2017). For example, C. siamense was previously assumed to be a species complex composed of several taxa (Yang et al. 2009, Wikee et al. 2011, Lima et al. 2013, Vieira et al. 2014, Sharma et al. 2015), but was shown to represent a single variable species in the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2016a). Based on recent progress, 14 Colletotrichum species complexes and 15 singleton species have been identified (Marin-Felix et al. 2017, Damme et al. 2019). The aims of the present study were as follows: i. identify the prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. associated with Pyrus anthracnose in the major production provinces in China; ii. validate the taxonomy of the Colletotrichum spp. through morphology and DNA phylogenetic analysis; and iii. evaluate their pathogenicity by proving Koch’s postulates. MATERIALS AND METHODS Sampling and Isolation A survey was conducted in 15 commercial pear orchards and four nurseries (Aug. 2013 to Oct. 2016) in the seven major pear cultivation provinces (Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang) of China. Two kinds of symptoms were observed on fruit: 1) bitter rot showing big sunken rot lesions (BrL), 10–35 mm diam., with embedded concentric acervuli, secreting an orange conidial mass under humid conditions; and 2) tiny black spots (TS) less than 1 mm diam., gradually increasing in number instead of in size during the season. Three symptom types were observed on leaves: 1) big necrotic lesions (BnL); 2) small round spots (SS); and 3) TS. The BnL symptoms were characterized by sunken necrotic lesions 5–10 mm diam., brown in the center but black along the margin, with black acervuli on the surface, secreting orange conidial tendrils under humid conditions. The SS symptoms were characterized by grey-white spots, 3–4 mm diam., circular to subcircular, grey-white in the center, with a dark-brown margin. The TS symptoms were characterized by tiny black spots of less than 1 mm diam., which increased in number instead of in size, accompanied by chlorosis, yellowing, and ‘green island regions’, resulting in defoliation. Fruits and leaves showing the symptoms explained above were collected from pear trees of P. pyrifolia cultivars (cvs.) Cuiguan, Guanyangxueli, Hohsui, Huanghua, Huali No. 1, Imamuraaki, Jinshui No. 1, Jinshui No. 2, and Xiangnan, P. bretschneideri cvs. Chili, Dangshansuli, Huangguan, Huangxianchangba, and Yali, and P. communis cv. Gyuiot in the surveyed orchards. Fungi were isolated and linked to symptom types. Diseased tissues (neighboring the asymptomatic regions) without sporulation were cut into small pieces (4–5 mm²) after surface sterilization (1% NaOCl for 45 s, 75% ethanol for
Photita et al. (2005). Excised tissues were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA: 20% diced potato, 2% glucose, 1.5% agar, and distilled water) plates and incubated at 28°C. For diseased tissues with sporulation, conidia were collected, suspended in sterilized water, diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10⁴ conidia per mL, and spread on the surface of water agar (WA: 2% agar and distilled water) to generate discrete colonies (Choi et al. 1999). Six single colonies of each isolate were picked up with a sterilized needle (insect pin, 0.5 mm diameter) and transferred onto PDA plates. Pure cultures were stored in 25% glycerol at -80°C until use. Type specimens of new species from this study were deposited in the Mycological Herbarium, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (HMAS), and ex-type living cultures were deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection Centre (CGMCC), Beijing, China.
DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing: Mycelial discs were transferred to PDA plates covered with sterile cellophane and incubated at 28°C in the dark for 5–7 days. Fungal genomic DNA was extracted with cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer (2% w/v CTAB, 1.42 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol) as previously described (Freeman et al. 1996). Six loci, including the 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), chitin synthase (CHS-1), and calmodulin (CAL) genes, were amplified using the primer pairs ITS4/ITS5 (White et al. 1990), GDF1/GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003), ACT-512F/ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), T1/Bt2b (Glass & Donaldson 1995, O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997), CHS-79F/CHS-345R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), and CL1C/CL2C (Wei et al. 2012), respectively. PCR amplification was conducted as described by Wei et al. (2012) but modified by using an annealing temperature of 56°C for ITS, 59°C for ACT and GAPDH, 58°C for TUB2 and CHS-1, and 57°C for CAL. PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced at Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China) Co., Ltd. Forward and reverse sequences were assembled to obtain a consensus sequence with DNAMAN (v. 9.0; Lynnon Biosoft). Sequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analyses: Multiple sequences of concatenated ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences were aligned using MAFFT v. 7 (Katoh & Standley 2013) with default settings, and if necessary, manually adjusted in MEGA v. 7.0.1 (Kumar et al. 2016). Bayesian inference (BI) was used to construct phylogenies using MrBayes v. 3.1.2 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004) was used to carry out statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution using the corrected Akaike information criterion (AIC) (Table 2). Two analyses of four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains were conducted from random trees with 1 × 10⁷ generations for the C. gloeo-sporioides species complex, 3 × 10⁶ for the C. dematium species complex and the related reference species involved in the same phylogenetic tree, and 2 × 10⁶ generations for C. acutatum and C. boninense species complexes. The analyses were sampled every 1,000 generations, which were stopped once the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. Convergence of all parameters was checked using the internal diagnostics of the standard deviation of split frequencies and performance scale reduction factors (PSRF).

The first 25% of trees were discarded as the burn-in phase of each analysis, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. Additionally, maximum parsimony analyses (MP) were performed on the multi-locus alignment using PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) v.4.0b10 (Swofford 2002). Phylogenetic trees were generated using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. Max trees were set up to 5000, branches of zero length collapsed, and all multiple parsimonioustrees were saved. Cladestability was assessed using a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Afterwards, tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated. Furthermore, maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were implemented on the multi-locus alignments using the RaxmlGUI v.1.3.1 (Silvestro & Michalak 2012). Cladestability was assessed using bootstrap analyses with 1000 replicates. A general time-reversible model (GTR) was applied with an invgamma-distributed rate variation. Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree v.1.4.2 (Rambaut 2014). The alignments and phylogenetic trees were deposited in TreeBASE (study 22264). For the phylogenetically close but not clearly delimited species, sequences were analyzed using the GCPSR model by performing a pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test as described by Quaedvlieg et al. (2014). The PHI test was performed in SplitsTree4 (Huson 1998, Huson & Kloepper 2005, Huson & Bryant 2006) to determine the recombination level within phylogenetically closely related species using a six-locus concatenated dataset (ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS). If the resulting pairwise homoplasy index was below a 0.05 threshold (Фw < 0.05), it was indicative of significant recombination in the dataset. The relationship between closely related species was visualized by constructing a splits graph. Morphological analysis Morphological and cultural features were characterized according to Yan et al. (2015). Briefly, mycelial discs (5 mm diam) were taken from the growing edge of 5-d-old cultures in triplicate, transferred on PDA, oatmeal agar (OA; Crous et al. 2009) and synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976), and incubated in the dark at 28°C. Colony diameters were measured daily for 5 d to calculate their mycelial growth rates (mm/d). The shape, color, and density of colonies were recorded after 6 d. Moreover, the shape, color, and size of sporocarps, conidia, conidiophores, asci, and ascospores were observed using light microscopy (Nikon Eclipse 90i or Olympus BX63, Japan), and 50 conidia or ascospores were measured to determine their sizes unless no or fewer spores were produced. Conidial appressoria were induced by dropping a conidial suspension (10^6 conidia/mL; 50 μL) on a concavity slide, placed inside plates containing moistened filter papers with distilled sterile water, and then incubated at 25°C in the dark. After incubating for 24 to 48 h, the sizes of 30 conidial appressoria formed at the ends of germ tubes were measured (Yang et al. 2009). Prevalence.
To determine the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in sampled provinces, the Pyrus spp. and pear organs (leaf or fruit) involved were established. The Isolation Rate (RI) was calculated for each species using the formula RI% = (NS / NI) × 100, where NS is the number of isolates from the same species and NI is the total number of isolates from each sample-collected province (Vieira et al. 2014, Wang et al. 2016). The overall RI was calculated using the NI value equal to the total number of isolates obtained from pear plants.
Pathogenicity Tests
Representative Colletotrichum isolates were selected for pathogenicity tests with a spore suspension on detached leaves (approximately 4 weeks old) of P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan in eight replicates as previously described (Cai et al. 2009). Briefly, healthy-looking leaves were collected, washed three times with sterile water, and air-dried on sterilized filter paper. The leaves were inoculated using the wound/drop and non-wound/drop inoculation methods (Lin et al. 2002, Kanchana-udomkan et al. 2004, Than et al. 2008). For the wound/drop method, an aliquot of 6 μL of spore suspension (1.0 × 10^6 conidia or ascospores per mL) was dropped on the left side of a leaf after wounding it once by pin-pricking with a sterilized needle (insect pin, 0.5 mm diameter), and sterile water was applied on the right side as a control. For the non-wound/drop method, the spore suspension was dropped on the left side of a leaf without prior wounding, with sterile water on the right side as a control. The infection rates were calculated using the formula (infection rate = the number of infected leaves or fruits / the number of inoculated leaves or fruits) at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) (Huang et al. 2013).
Additionally, pathogenicity was determined on detached mature pear fruits of P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan in triplicate as previously described (Cai et al. 2009). Briefly, healthy fruits were surface-sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes, washed three times with sterile water, and air-dried. The wound/drop and non-wound/drop inoculation methods were also used (Lin et al. 2002, Kanchana-udomkan et al. 2004, Than et al. 2008). For the wound/drop method, an aliquot of 6 μL of spore suspension (1 × 10^6 conidia or ascospores per mL) was dropped on the fruits after wounding three times with a sterilized needle (5 mm deep). For the non-wound/drop method, the same spore suspension was directly dropped on the surface of unwounded pear fruits. Sterile water was applied to the fruit as a control. Symptom development under wounded conditions was evaluated by determining the mean lesion lengths at 10 dpi. Symptom development on fruits was studied by determining the infection rates at 30 dpi using the aforementioned formula.
After inoculation, the detached leaves and fruits were placed on plastic trays, covered with plastic wrap to maintain a 99% relative humidity, and incubated at 25°C with a 12/12 hour light/dark photoperiod. Pathogens were re-isolated from the resulting samples.

Fig. 4 A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 41 isolates in the C. boninense species complex. The species C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878) was selected as an outgroup. The tree was built using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS genes. Bayesian posterior probability (PP≥0.90), MP bootstrap support values (ML≥50%), and RAxML bootstrap support values (ML≥50%) are shown at the nodes (PP/MP/ML). Ex-type isolates are in bold. Coloured blocks indicate clades containing isolates from Pyrus spp. in this study; circles indicate isolates isolated from leaves. The scale bar indicates 0.04 expected changes per site.

RESULTS Colletotrichum isolates associated with pear anthracnose A total of 295 pear samples (249 leaves and 46 fruits) affected by pear anthracnose, including BrLandTS on fruits, and BnL, SS, and TS on leaves were collected for fungal isolation, resulting in a total of 488 Colletotrichum isolates identified based on morphology and ITS sequence data. A total of 90 representative isolates were chosen for further analyses based on their morphology (colony shape, colour, and conidial morphology), ITS sequence data, symptom type, origin, and host cultivar involved (Table 1). Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses The 90 representative isolates (Table 1) together with 181 reference isolates from previously described species (Table 3) were subjected to multi-locus phylogenetic analyses with concatenated ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences for those belonging to the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes, or with concatenated ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences for other species of which no CAL sequences are available. The results showed that isolates clustered together with 12 species in five Colletotrichum species complexes, including gloeosporioides (50 isolates), acutatum (15), boninense (14), dematium (5), and orchidearum (1), and one singleton species (5) (Fig. 2–5). In the phylogenetic tree constructed for the isolates in the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 50 isolates clustered in six clades corresponding to C. fructicola (14 isolates), C. aenigma (11), C. siamense (11), C. gloeosporioides (11), C. wuxiense (2), and C. conoides (1) (Fig. 2). For the isolate
Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC 3.15172 is part of the C. dematium species complex. Additionally, the remaining five isolates, which formed a distinct clade (1/100/100), clustered distantly from any known Colletotrichum species complex (Fig. 5). To exclude the possibility that species delimitation might be affected by recombination among the genes used for phylogenetic analyses, the multi-locus (ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS) concatenated datasets were subjected to two PHI tests (Fig. 6) to determine the recombination level within phylogenetically closely related species. The results showed that no significant recombination events were observed between C. jinshuiense and phylogenetically related isolates or species (Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC 3.15172, C. anthrisci, and C. fructi) (Fig. 6a), and between C. pyrifoliae and phylogenetically related isolates or species (Colletotrichum sp. isolate Q026, C. boninense, and C. kahawae) (Fig. 6b).
Taxonomy: Based on morphology and multi-locus sequence data, the 90 isolates were assigned to 12 Colletotrichum spp. Of these, two species proved to represent new taxa that are described below. Six species are reported from pear for the first time. Eight species formed sexual morphs in vitro.

Notes — Although C. gloeosporioides has been identified as responsible for pear anthracnose in China, these identifications were chiefly based on morphology and/or ITS sequence data (Wu et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2013b). In this study, 20 isolates of C. gloeosporioides isolated from fruits and leaves of pear were identified as C. gloeosporioides based on multi-loci phylogenetic analyses and confirmed as responsible for

Culture characteristics — Colonies on PDA flat with entire margin, aerial mycelium sparse, cottony, surface pale grey-black with white margin; reverse black to dark grey-green in center with white margin. Colony diameter 56–57 mm in 5 d. Conidia in mass not observed on PDA or SNA.
Materials examined. China, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, on leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Jinshui, 1 Aug. 2016, M. Fu (holotype HMAS247824, culture ex-type CGMCC3.18903 = PAFQ26); ibid., cultures PAFQ26a, PAFQ26b, PAFQ26c, and PAFQ26d.
Notes — Isolates of C. jinshuiense are phylogenetically closely related to Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC3.15172 (Fig. 5), which was reported as an endophytic Colletotrichum species from Bletilla ochracea (Orchidaceae) in China (Tao et al. 2013), whereas they are different in GAPDH (94.98%), and TUB2 (98.12%). Furthermore, the PHI test (Φw = 1) did not detect recombination between these isolates and Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC3.15172 (Fig. 6a). In this study, C. jinshuiense clustered in the C. dematium species complex, which is often associated with herbaceous plants (Dammet et al. 2009). The asexual and sexual morphs of C. jinshuiense were not observed on PDA or SNA, while they easily developed on pear fruit and leaves, indicating that pear tissue plays an important part in the epidemiology and life cycle of C. jinshuiense.

Notes—Colletotrichum pyrifoliae is phylogenetically closely related to Colletotrichum sp. isolate Q026 (Fig. 5), which was reported to be associated with anthracnose of Rubus glaucus in Colombia (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2014). However, C. pyrifoliae differs from the latter in ACT (95.62% sequence identity), CHS-1 (96.47%), GAPDH (93.01%), ITS (99.25%), and TUB2 (96.41%) sequences. Moreover, isolates of C. pyrifoliae have larger conidia (PAFQ22, 14–23 × 5.5–7 µm, mean ± SD = 18.1 ± 1.8 × 6.4 ± 0.4 μm) than those of Colletotrichum sp. isolate Q026 (mean = 10.4 × 2.9 μm). The PHI test (Φw = 0.9862) detected no significant recombination between the isolates and Colletotrichum sp. isolate Q026 (Fig. 6b). Colletotrichum pyrifoliae is a singleton species, which grouped neither with the C. gloeosporioides nor the C. boninense species complexes (Fig. 5). Colletotrichum siamense Prihast et al., Fung.

Notes—According to multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, two isolates (PAFQ53, PAFQ54) from pear leaves clustered with the ex-type culture of C. wuxiense (CGMCC3.17894), initially reported on Camellia sinensis in China (Wang et al., 2016). Notably, the conidium sizes of C. wuxiense isolates in this study (PAFQ53: 11.5–17 × 4.5–6.5 μm, mean ± SD = 14.9 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.3 μm; PAFQ54: 13–18 × 4.5–6 μm, mean ± SD = 15.0 ± 1.3 × 5.1 ± 0.4 μm) were smaller than those of the ex-type culture (CGMCC3.17894: 16.5–23 × 4.5–6.5 μm, mean ± SE = 19.0 ± 1.4 × 5.6 ± 0.5 μm). This is the first report of C. wuxiense causing anthracnose on P. pyrifolia and the first description of its sexual morph.
Prevalence of Colletotrichum species: Analyses of 12 Colletotrichum species revealed that C. fructicola isolates (298 isolates, 61.1% of the total) were predominantly isolated from six provinces (Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang), followed by C. fioriniae (52 isolates, 10.7%), C. siamense (43 isolates, 8.8%), C. aenigma (40 isolates, 8.2%), C. gloeosporioides (20 isolates, 4.1%), and C. karstii (19 isolates, 3.9%). The remaining six species accounted for 3.2% of the isolates. These results indicate that C. fructicola is the most dominant species on pear in China, with C. aenigma, C. fioriniae, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, and C. siamense being less dominant. The least dominant species include C. citricola, C. conoides, C. jinshuiense, C. plurivorum, C. pyrifoliae, and C. wuxiense. Moreover, C. fructicola isolates causing black spot symptoms were mainly found in the Yangtze Valley regions of Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces.
Analyses of the isolation rates in sampled provinces showed that C. fructicola was dominant in Fujian, Jiangxi, Jiangsu, Anhui, and Zhejiang, accounting for 85.2%, 83.8%, 80.4%, 78%, and 71.4% of the obtained isolates, respectively. Isolates of other species accounted for less than 15%. However, in Shandong province, C. siamense isolates were predominant, making up 95% of the total isolates. In Hubei province, C. fructicola, C. fioriniae, and C. aenigma were commonly isolated, accounting for 27.5%, 26.7%, and 25.0%, respectively.
Analyses of isolation rates from each sampled pear species revealed that C. fructicola was dominant on P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri, accounting for 64.5% and 79.7% of the total isolates, respectively, followed by C. fioriniae (11.8%), C. aenigma (9.3%), C. karstii (4.9%), and C. gloeosporioides (4.6%) from P. pyrifolia, and C. fioriniae (6.8%), C. aenigma (6.8%), C. plurivorum (3.4%), and C. gloeosporioides (3.4%) from P. bretschneideri. The remaining species (C. citricola, C. conoides, C. jinshuiense, ...) were also identified.
C. pyrifoliae, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense were isolated in low incidence (less than 5.0%) from P. pyrifolia. Only C. siamense and C. fioriniae were isolated from P. communis, with the former accounting for 95% and the latter for 5% (Fig. 19c). Analyses of the incidence of these Colletotrichum species from the leaves and fruits revealed that C. aenigma, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. fioriniae, and C. siamense were isolated from both leaves and fruits, while C. citricola, C. jinshuiense, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, and C. pyrifoliae were isolated only from leaves, and C. conoides only from fruits (Fig. 19d).
Thirteen representative Colletotrichum isolates (one from each species, except two from C. fructicola related to different symptom types) were selected to prove Koch’s postulates using a spore suspension on detached leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan. Under unwounded conditions, only C. fructicola (isolate PAFQ31) and C. siamense (isolate PAFQ78) were pathogenic to leaves, inducing lesions on the leaf tissues (Fig. 20). Of these, isolate PAFQ31 caused TS symptoms at 8 dpi (Fig. 20b2), while isolate PAFQ78 caused extended BnL symptoms at 14 dpi (Fig. 20b5).
Under wounded conditions at 29 dpi, all species were pathogenic to leaves, but with varying infection rates depending on the species/isolates (Table 5), ranging from 2/16 for C. plurivorum (isolate PAFQ65) to 16/16 for C. fructicola (isolate PAFQ31). In successful infections, all species initially induced small dark-brown to black necrotic lesions at 6 dpi (or 10 dpi for C. citricola isolate PAFQ13). The lesions rapidly expanded into large dark-brown to black lesions, with lesion lengths varying among species (Fig. 20c1–c13). Concentric rings of acervuli formed on the leaf tissues, exuding an orange conidial mass (6–10 dpi) at 25°C under 99% relative humidity. It is worth noting that C. fructicola isolate PAFQ31, isolated from a leaf showing TS symptoms in the field, induced similar symptoms around the BnL on inoculated leaves (Fig. 20c2), while another C. fructicola isolate PAFQ32, isolated from a leaf showing BnL symptoms, induced large black lesions only (Fig. 20c3). Moreover, C. conoides isolate PAFQ6, which was only isolated from pear fruits, also caused BnL symptoms on pear leaves (Fig. 20c7). No lesions were induced in control fruits inoculated with sterile water.
Under unwounded conditions, all isolates from the fruits were pathogenic at 30 dpi, with infection rates ranging from 2/6 for C. fioriniae (PAFQ19) to 5/6 for C. gloeosporioides (PAFQ61). These isolates began to induce small brown or dark brown lesions at different time points post-inoculation: 28–30 dpi for C. aenigma, C. conoides, and C. fioriniae; 18–22 dpi for C. gloeosporioides; and 6–8 dpi for C. siamense. The small lesions expanded to larger brown or dark brown lesions over time, forming concentric rings of acervuli at 4–6 dpi, which exuded an orange conidium mass. For the isolates from pear leaves, only C. fructicola isolates (PAFQ31 and PAFQ32) were pathogenic, with infection rates of 6/6 for isolate PAFQ31 and 5/6 for isolate PAFQ32. Notably, these isolates induced black spots and fruit rot symptoms at 30 dpi, similar in size to those observed on leaves in the field. The remaining six species isolated from pear leaves did not induce any visual fruit symptoms. Under wounded conditions, all species were pathogenic to pear fruits at 10 dpi, but with varying aggressiveness among species. The isolates of the C. gloeosporioides species complex induced significantly longer lesions (40–62.5 mm) compared to those induced by C. fioriniae (20–22 mm), C. citricola (3 mm), C. karstii (31–32 mm), C. pyrifoliae (20.5 mm), and C. jinshuiense (24.5 mm). No lesions were induced in control fruits inoculated with sterile water. From the diseased leaf and fruit tissues, fungi were isolated from lesions neighboring asymptomatic regions, and the obtained colonies matched the originals used for inoculation regarding their morphology and ITS sequence data.
In this study, we employed morphological and multi-locus phylogenetic analyses to identify the species associated with pear anthracnose, and pathogenicity tests to confirm Koch’s postulates. We revealed 12 species belonging to five Colletotrichum species complexes, including gloeosporioides (C. aenigma, C. conoides, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense), acutatum (C. fioriniae), boninense (C. citricola and C. karstii), dematium (C. jinshuiense), orchidarium (C. plurivorum), and one singleton species (C. pyrifoliae). Among these, C. conoides, C. siamense, C. wuxiense, C. citricola, C. karstii, and C. plurivorum were confirmed to be responsible for pear anthracnose for the first time. Importantly, this study differentiated two new species responsible for pear anthracnose: C. jinshuiense and C. pyrifoliae. Corresponding to the taxonomic classification determined by multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, most Colletotrichum species exhibited characteristic morphological traits, including colony colors, aerial mycelium density, and shapes and sizes of conidia, ascospores, appressoria, and setae. Most of these features have been used to delineate species in previous studies. It is worth noting that the Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose secreted pigments that differed in color among species and isolates. Moreover, these species also varied in their ability to form sexual morphs in culture.
For example, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, C. fioriniae, and C. jinshuiense produced no ascospores under the culture conditions employed. Additionally, C. citricola and C. jinshuiense produced setae on the host tissues, but C. aenigma and C. siamense did so on PDA. Importantly, the macro- and micro-morphologies of the Colletotrichum species isolated from pear showed differences compared with those from other plants. For instance, most of the C. gloeosporioides isolates (e.g., PAFQ56, PAFQ61, and PAFQ7; 15.5–32 μm) from pear had longer conidia than those from tea (11–15.5 μm) (Liu et al., 2015) and citrus (11.3–14.7 μm) (Huang et al., 2013); and most of the C. fructicola isolates (PAFQ30, PAFQ31, and PAFQ84; 14.0–20 × 4.5–7.5 μm) from pear had larger conidia than those from coffee (9.7–14 × 3–4.3 μm) (Prihastuti et al., 2009). The prevalence of a Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose is closely related to the sampling area, Pyrus sp., and plant organ. For example, C. fructicola is the most prevalent species in most pear-growing regions in China studied and most frequently isolated from P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri in all the sampled areas except for Shandong province, where C. siamense was most frequently isolated and prevalent on P. communis. Geographical preference was also found for C. aenigma and C. fioriniae, which were mainly isolated in Hubei province. However, C. jinshuiense, C. pyrifoliae, C. wuxiense, C. plurivorum, C. conoides, and C. citricola showed low prevalence and restricted distribution. Moreover, a high species diversity was observed in Hubei province compared to Fujian and Shandong provinces. It is worth noting that C. acutatum, C. pyricola, and C. salicis were not detected in this study, although they were linked to pear anthracnose in New Zealand (Damm et al., 2012b).
In previous reports, the pathogenicity of most identified Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose, including C. aenigma, C. fructicola, C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. pyricola, and C. salicis (Dammet et al. 2012b, Weir et al. 2012, Jiang et al. 2014, Schena et al. 2014, Zhang et al. 2015), remained unresolved. Here, pathogenicity tests were conducted to confirm Koch’s postulates for all isolated species to clarify their pathogenicity. The data revealed that the Colletotrichum species/isolates showed broad diversity in their pathogenicity and aggressiveness. Notably, C. fructicola caused typical symptoms on leaves and fruits under unwounded conditions, while it caused rot symptoms on fruits or necrotic lesions on leaves under wounded conditions. The BnL symptoms on leaves could also be induced by C. fructicola isolates, if those isolates were obtained from leaves showing BnL symptoms, indicating that C. fructicola has two pathogenic types. Other species, including C. aenigma, C. citricola, C. wuxiense, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, and C. siamense, are also related to the leaf BnL symptoms. C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. aenigma, C. gloeosporioides, C. pyrifoliae, and C. jinshuiense are associated with leaf SS symptoms, while C. aenigma, C. fioriniae, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. conoides are related to fruit BrL symptoms. Notably, many isolates caused obvious lesions on fruits (or leaves) under wounded conditions but not under unwounded conditions. This phenomenon is related to the quiescent infection of these species, which is an important feature of Colletotrichum spp. and occurs at the immature fruit stage, progressively developing to rot as the fruits ripen (Peres et al. 2005, Alkan et al. 2015, De Silva et al. 2017). Previous results indicated that wounding can break the quiescent infection and enhance the infectivity of C. fructicola, leading to more rapid rot of young and mature fruits (Jiang et al. 2014). It is worth noting that although the 12 species obtained in this study can infect pear fruits under wounded conditions, those isolated from pear leaves (C. citricola, C. jinshuiense, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. pyrifoliae, and C. wuxiense) showed no pathogenicity to pear fruits (P. bretschneideri cv. Huang Guan) under unwounded conditions up to 30 dpi. These results revealed a clear organ specificity for the pathogenicity of some Colletotrichum isolates. Some studies also provide clues that some isolates of Glomerella cingulata, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum are host organ-specific; they mainly infected the leaves instead of causing bitter rot on apple and pear fruit (Yano et al. 2004, González et al. 2006, Tashiro et al. 2012). Additionally, most isolates belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex showed higher aggressiveness than those of C. fioriniae, C. citricola, and C. pyrifoliae. Previous studies revealed that C. fructicola caused anthracnose on many plants, e.g., Citrus reticulata (Huang et al. 2013), Capsicum sp. (Diao et al. 2017), Camellia sinensis (Liu et al. 2015), Mangifera indica (Lima et al. 2013), and Malus sp. (Munir et al. 2016), resulting in lesions rather than typical symptoms. Therefore, it is interesting that C. fructicola causes typical symptoms on pear. Colletotrichum aenigma was reported on P. pyrifolia in Japan (Weir et al. 2012) and P. communis in Italy (Schena et al. 2014) without mention of the infected organs and induced symptoms. This is the first report of C. aenigma inducing pear anthracnose of P. bretschneideri (on fruits and leaves) and P. pyrifoliae (on leaves) in China, with a dominant incidence on the latter. Colletotrichum fioriniae was reported causing leaf spots on Cinnamomum subavenium and Juglans regia in China (Sun et al. 2012, Zhu et al. 2015), Salvia leucantha in Italy.
Pyrus spp. in the USA and Croatia (Dammeta et al. 2012b, Ivic et al. 2013) and P. communis in France (Da Lio et al. 2017). This is the first report of C. fioriniae in China, which caused pear bitter rot and was associated with pear leaf spot on P. pyrifolia, P. bretschneideri, and P. communis. Colletotrichum citricola was first reported on Citrus unchiu in China, where it was a saprobe on leaves (Huang et al. 2013), but this is the first report of C. citricola on P. pyrifolia, where it was found to cause anthracnose on pear leaves. This study provides the first systematic investigation, morphological, molecular, and biological characterization of Colletotrichum spp. associated with Pyrus plants, and represents the first reports of C. citricola, C. conoides, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense, together with the novel species causing anthracnose on pear. This study also reveals taxonomic, morphological, and biological diversity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with different Pyrus spp. in China in respect to tissue type, geographical location, and climate, contributing useful information to help understand the ecology of the Colletotrichum spp. involved in pear anthracnose.
