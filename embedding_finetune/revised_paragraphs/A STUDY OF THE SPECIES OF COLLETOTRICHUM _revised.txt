A STUDY OF THE SPECIES OF COLLETOTRICHUM CAUSING RIPE FRUIT ROTS IN QUEENSLAND
By J. H. SIMMONDS, M.B.E., M.Sc.
SUMMARY
Seven species of Colletotrichum known to cause ripe fruit rots in Queensland are compared concerning spore measurements, cultural characters, temperature reactions, and host range determined by field collection and artificial inoculation. The characteristic features of these organisms are discussed, and based on the available evidence, it is found desirable to designate a new form of C. gloeosporioides and one new species.
I. INTRODUCTION
Ripe fruit rots are a common source of loss in Queensland, especially in tropical and subtropical fruits. Of the associated pathogens, species of the genus Colletotrichum are the most prevalent. These organisms are particularly suited to causing these diseases. Their ability to maintain a saprophytic existence on dying host parts provides a continuous source of inoculum. Furthermore, by forming latent infections throughout the growing period, the parasite becomes largely independent of environmental conditions at ripening, as well as protected from fungicides.
Several distinct species of Colletotrichum are linked to ripe fruit rots in Queensland, and multiple species may affect a single variety of fruit. This paper aims to categorize these species accurately while summarizing their main characteristics. The hope is that the information will aid future identifications and enhance the understanding of the significance of individual diseases.
Taxonomy within the genus Colletotrichum has long been problematic, with many poorly defined species. Arx (1957a, 1957b) attempted to clarify this taxonomy, achieving a useful simplification and highlighting the need for a significant reduction in species. However, some species or groups listed by Arx may warrant separate status upon further investigation. This has been demonstrated in this study, where a previously described variety was utilized to designate one such group.
The species examined in this study include Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, stat. conid. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz.; G. cingulata var. minor Wr., stat. conid. C. gloeosporioides var. minor var. nov.; C. musae (Berk. & Curt.) Arx (Gloeosporium musarum Cke. & Mass.); Colletotrichum atramentarium (Berk. & Br.) Taubenh.; C. dematium (Pers. ex Fr.) Grove; C. orbiculare (Berk. & Mont.) Arx; C. acutatum sp. nov. With the introduction of a variety, the original species G. cingulata should be strictly designated G. cingulata var. cingulata. However, in this paper, reference to this species as originally understood is made simply by omitting a varie
Imperfect stage. For many species of Colletotrichum, reliance must be placed on conidial measurements, as the perfect stage occurs rarely or not at all. With spores as small and characterless as those of Colletotrichum, small differences, although valid, are often difficult to demonstrate, and individual variability results in inevitable overlap between species. As noted by Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949), extreme values are of little use when comparing spore measurements of species of Colletotrichum unless accompanied by the mean, as the coverage is usually too broad for delimiting species. This is why many of the older descriptions are so difficult to interpret. Instead of extremes, the range of mean values for different collections or isolations is presented. These individual means are based on the measurement of 15 spores in each case.
The data includes conidial measurements of seven species of Colletotrichum as they occur in Queensland. For C. gloeosporioides, 36 collections showed a range of means from 11.9 to 17.0 micrometers in length and 3.6 to 5.8 micrometers in breadth, with a general mean of 13.8 by 4.8 micrometers. C. gloeosporioides var. minor had 133 collections, with mean dimensions ranging from 11.1 to 17.7 by 3.1 to 5.0 micrometers, averaging 14.0 by 3.7 micrometers. C. musae, from eight collections, displayed means of 12.2 to 14.6 by 4.9 to 5.8 micrometers. Recent collections of C. musae also showed a similar range. C. acutatum had 35 collections with measurements varying from 8.3 to 14.4 by 2.5 to 4.0 micrometers, averaging 11.1 by 3.1 micrometers. C. orbiculare's 22 collections ranged from 10.0 to 13.5 by 3.1 to 4.5 micrometers, with a mean of 11.7 by 3.7 micrometers. C. atramentarium, from seven collections, measured 17.1 to 20.5 by 3.0 to 4.1 micrometers, averaging 19.3 by 3.5 micrometers. Lastly, C. dematium showed dimensions from 19.1 to 26.4 by 2.6 to 3
ANALYTICAL COMPARISON OF CONIDIAL MEASUREMENTS OF Colletotrichum SPP.
The mean breadth measurements of various organisms are as follows:
Statistical significance indicates that both A and B are greater than C at the 1% level, and A is greater than B.
The perfect stage, Glomerella cingulata, the perithecial stage of C. gloeosporioides, frequently occurs both on the host plant and in culture. On papaw, lesions that give rise to perithecial or conidial isolates are often recognizable macroscopically. Perithecia of G. cingulata var. minor have been observed only occasionally in culture. The appearance of ascospores of both forms is similar, differing mainly in size. Both ascospores are faintly brown with poorly staining contents. Measurements were primarily taken from this type, and details are provided in the following text.
Ascospores Measurements of Glomerella cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor
The examination included 29 collections of G. cingulata with a mean length of 18.3 µm and mean breadth of 5.4 µm, and 25 collections of G. cingulata var. minor with a mean length of 15.6 µm and mean breadth of 4.2 µm. The difference in means between the two species was found to be significant at the 1% level.
Cultural Characters
Cultural work was predominantly conducted using potato dextrose agar medium in petri dishes. Although various other media were occasionally tested, they did not significantly reduce existing variation. Tube cultures were often unsatisfactory for observing essential differences, and cultural characteristics varied considerably over time and with subculturing. Fresh isolates were preferred for accurate assessment.
Throughout this study, hundreds of isolates were examined, most conforming to the characteristics of specific groups with sufficient constancy for reasonable classification. However, some isolates were difficult to categorize, and the absence of spore formation in many cases hindered identity verification. These atypical forms were not included in subsequent descriptions.
Examination of isolates occurred over the past 15 years, indicating that certain periods were marked by the prevalence of particular cultural types in C. gloeosporioides and its variety minor. Thus, it is unwise to designate any one cultural type as the normal form, as both organisms display considerable variability in cultural appearance, setting them apart from other fruit-rotting species discussed.
Description of Perithecial Form
The aerial mycelium of G. cingulata is fine, white to light grey, moderately elevated, and somewhat sparse and open. T
SPECIES OF COLLETOTRICHUM
Colletotrichum species are distinguished by their growth characteristics. The mycelium typically projects spicuously from the surface and is not embedded, unlike var. minor. Smaller, scattered, sooty perithecial elements may also be present. Mature ascospores are commonly found in cultures.
Aerial mycelium is fine, low in elevation, and usually dense. From above, the general color ranges from white to light grey, or may appear darker when there is a dark substratum beneath. In such cases, the margin typically appears white or pinkish. From below, the substrate color can be light or dark in the center, with a light or pinkish margin.
A notable type often isolated from passion-fruit features low, compact, white, aerial mycelium with scattered conspicuous black bodies, which may bear conidia and function as sporodochia. In general, conidial production in culture tends to be limited.
Glomerella cingulata var. minor, commonly known as C. gloeosporioides var. minor, exhibits rapid growth and a coarser mycelium compared to G. cingulata var. cingulata. Field isolations mainly yield conidial or sterile types, characterized by cottony or woolly, abundant aerial mycelium that is well elevated from the surface. The coloration ranges from white to shades of grey. Occasionally, forms with less elevated mycelium appear, making them difficult to distinguish from elevated cultural types unless conidia are present. Conidial production is typically more abundant than in C. gloeosporioides, resulting in a pinkish hue or the formation of pink masses in acervuli.
Colletotrichum musae (Gloeosporium musarum) presents distinct cultural characteristics. Three cultural types are recognized, with the normal form most commonly found in field isolations. This form is uniform, with white to light grey, loose, open aerial mycelium that is not greatly elevated. Spores are produced early and abundantly, giving the colony a characteristic pink appearance.
Colletotrichum acutatum is a relatively slow-growing species with moderately dense, well-elevated aerial mycelium. Its surface may appear finely tufted,
SPECIES OF COLLETOTRICHUM
The species displays a range of colors, from grey to greyish brown. This overlay sometimes has a crystalline appearance. From below, the substrate is white or cream, occasionally exhibiting a creamy pink diffusion. Darker patches, if present, are usually irregular. Recently, a series of isolates obtained from papaw exhibited a bright pink coloration. Other characteristics, apart from color, proved to be normal. The production of conidia in this species is characteristically abundant, distributed throughout the mycelium, although massed conidiophores, resembling acervuli, may occur. The superficial spore masses seen in C. gloeosporioides var. minor are encountered less frequently. Occasionally, salmon-colored spore masses can be seen through the media from below, though not obvious from above. The color of spore masses in C. gloeosporioides var. minor and C. acutatum differs slightly, with the former tending toward pink and the latter toward salmon. In a series of inoculations on papaw, when examined using Ridgway's "Colour Standards and Nomenclature," the spores of C. gloeosporioides var. minor were referred to as bitter sweet pink, while those of C. acutatum were described as capucine orange.
Colletotrichum orbiculare shows characteristically slow growth. When first isolated, the aerial mycelium is usually fine, scanty, and of low elevation, with a surface that may appear almost powdery. The typical color is pinkish, usually becoming grey to dark grey in the center, with a pinkish margin that may have a submerged edge. From below, the substrate is dark in the center with a fairly broad cream or pinkish margin. With subculturing, the pink color tends to fade, and the aerial mycelium may develop into a grey, fairly compact growth of moderate elevation, making it less distinct from types developed by other species. Fresh isolations often produce conidia, which may appear as small pink spore masses scattered over the surface.
Colletotrichum atramentarium presents fine, scanty aerial mycelium that remains close to the surface, with a general color ranging from white to pale pink. A well-defined black speckling develops from the center due to the formation of sclerotial bodies characteristic of this species. From below, the substrate is speckled grey in the center with a pinkish margin. With subculturing, the pinkish color tends to disappear, revealing sectors of denser, more elevated grey mycelium. If the sclerotium-forming habit is completely lost, little distinguishes the culture from some other species.
Colletotrichum dematium features fine, white or grey aerial mycelium, which can be somewhat scanty or, in some isolates, more abundant and moderately elevated. The color is typically dark in the center with a broad white margin. In a fruiting culture, the setae may give the surface a finely tufted appearance. From below, the substratum is dark grey or speckled grey with a white margin. Scattered dusky acervuli are present in fruiting cultures, and spore masses are usually st
Ascospore isolations have been made from the Queensland G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor. Cultural types obtained from the former could be correlated fairly well with those described from Ipomoea, while those obtained from the latter resembled more closely Struble and Keitt's types from apple. A description of the Queensland types is given below. The terminology used is, as far as correlation is possible, that of the authors cited above.
(i) Glomerella cingulata
(a) Plus type: This is the same as has been described earlier for the perithecial form of G. cingulata obtained from field isolations. It forms a definite perithecial line with minus types.
(b) Minus type: Slight to scanty amounts of open, wispy, grey or black aerial mycelium occur over a dark background. From below, the substrate is dark olive to black, typically mottled but not always so. Numbers of small, globular, immature, or occasionally mature perithecial elements are embedded in the surface. Conidia are usually scarce but occasionally more plentiful. Minus types form a definite perithecial line with plus types. When used in artificial inoculation experiments, they are characteristically non-pathogenic.
(c) Sterile: Aerial mycelium is close, white, and appressed to the surface, forming a dense white mat without elevated hyphae. From below, the substrate is white, cream, or pinkish, sometimes developing grey or olive from the center, imparting a darker appearance to the surface view. The name "sterile" is chosen from the terms conidial and sterile used by Lucas, Chilton, and Edgerton (1944), as conidia are usually rare or absent and no perithecial line is formed with plus or minus types. It is not unusual for cultures of the sterile type to be obtained in field isolations.
(d) Yellow: Aerial mycelium is scanty and white on a background of light yellow. The rate of growth is similar to that of other forms, but pathogenicity is reduced and spore size is abnormal. This type is not obtained in field isolations.
(ii) Glomerella cingulata var. minor
(a) Plus type: Aerial mycelium is relatively coarse, cottony, grey, of moderate elevation and density, and may be slightly aggregated. From below, the substrate is grey in various degrees of density. The general appearance is similar to that of a common non-perithecial form obtained from field isolates. The distinguishing feature is the prese
Ascospore isolations have been made from the Queensland strains of G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor. The cultural types obtained from G. cingulata correlate fairly well with those described from Ipomoea, whereas those from G. cingulata var. minor resemble more closely the types from apple as detailed by Struble and Keitt. A description of the Queensland types follows, utilizing terminology consistent with the cited authors.
(i) Glomerella cingulata
(ii) Glomerella cingulata var. minor
Whether these represent the conidial or sterile types of American authors is uncertain. A yellow isolate similar to the one produced by G. cingulata is occasionally obtained, although this is not found in field isolates. Some authors have suggested using the characteristics of the appressorium as one criterion for separating species of Colletotrichum. The size and shape of the appressoria formed by the species discussed here were briefly investigated, but the differences did not appear to warrant a more detailed examination. The mean length was mostly between 8 and 9 µm, with mean breadth between 6.0 and 6.5 µm. The appressoria of C. atramentarium were somewhat larger, with a mean length of 11.3 µm, while those of C. musae were shorter, averaging 7.7 µm. The majority examined were obovate, but in all species, some individuals were definitely lobed or angular. Those of C. acutatum were generally more regular, whereas those of C. musae were less so.
Reaction to temperature is a useful criterion for separating some species of Colletotrichum. This character was investigated for the species Glomerella cingulata var. cingulata, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor, C. acutatum, C. orbiculare, and C. dematium. Three or four typical isolates were used in each case. The procedure involved inoculating potato dextrose agar slopes in tubes or medicine bottles with uniform circles cut from a young PDA culture of the test fungus. These were held at room temperature overnight until growth began to show and then incubated in a multiple-temperature incubator over a range of 15°C to 36°C, with an interval of approximately 1.5°C between compartments. After four days, the growth was recorded as the diameter of the colony minus the diameter of the original inoculum.
The temperature data for five species of Colletotrichum show the number of isolates studied, their optimum growth temperatures, maximum growth temperatures, and mean growth at optimum temperature. For Glomerella cingulata, the optimum temperature ranged from 26.5°C to 28.5°C with a maximum growth of 6.3 cm. For C. gloeosporioides var. minor, the optimum was 26.0°C to 28.5°C with a maximum growth of 7.3 cm. C. dematium had an optimum range of 27.5°C to 29.5°C and a maximum growth of 5.1 cm. C. acutatum showed an optimum of 25.0°C to 26.5°C with a maximum growth of 3.8 cm, while C. orbiculare had an optimum range of 24.5°C to 26.5°C and a maximum growth of 2.7 cm.
In a comparison of growth-temperature curves of six species of Colletotrichum, the results indicate that C. musae is a fast-growing species with a high optimum and maximum growth temperature. G. cingulata resembles C. musae but has a slightly lower growth ra
Temperature reactions of the isolates grouped by Edgerton (1915) as G. fructigenum closely resemble those of the Queensland C. acutatum. In fact, there is nothing in Edgerton's description to indicate they are not the same organism. However, the spore dimensions usually attributed to G. fructigenum set it apart from C. acutatum, and the former is perhaps more correctly considered a synonym or form of C. gloeosporioides. The four isolates of C. acutatum employed here were from papaw. Sturgess (1957), using isolates from strawberry, obtained a somewhat higher optimum for this species. Two recent isolates from strawberry leaves showed an optimum of 26.8 °C. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor is, as would be expected, very similar to G. cingulata. C. dematium is a moderately fast-growing species with a relatively high optimum and maximum.
Over the years, species of Colletotrichum have been isolated on many occasions from fruit and vegetative parts of economic plants in Queensland. The pathogenicity of the various species to their usual hosts is well established. In cases where a species has been recovered from a particular host only occasionally and no pathogenicity tests have been carried out, the nature of the lesion and the circumstances of the isolation have been taken as evidence for or against its presence in a pathogenic capacity. In the course of this work, it became evident that one species of plant may host more than one species of Colletotrichum, so with this genus, the identity of the host is not necessarily sound evidence for the identity of the pathogen. However, some fruits that are particularly prone to anthracnose are subject to attack by only one organism. Two such fruits are mango and banana. In contrast, papaw and capsicum are remarkably hospitable hosts.
A host list of the species of Colletotrichum affecting fruit in Queensland includes various plant families and species. The identity of the pathogen has been determined by both cultural characters and spore measurements. The number of collections from which each particular species was obtained is indicated under the specific host-parasite combination. These figures do not necessarily provide a true indication of the relative frequency of occurrence on the different hosts, except in the case of banana, papaw, mango, avocado, and strawberry, each of which has received considerable attention. It is hoped that the present paper will pave the way for an extension to this list.
The host range of fruit-attacking species of Colletotrichum in Queensland includes a variety of hosts across different plant families. For example, under the AGAVACEAE family, Phormium tenax (New Zealand

Matthews (1953, 1955a, 1955b) investigated leaf spots on various garden plants and weeds in the Brisbane district. The associated organism was isolated, and its cultural and morphological characteristics were described, followed by cross-inoculations. This research identified the causal organism as Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, though no distinction between its varieties was made. Based on Matthews’ findings, it is possible to separate G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor with reasonable accuracy. Isolates from azalea (Rhododendron indicum Sweet), Hoya australis R.Br., and H. carnosa R.Br., as well as some from stock (Matthiola incana (L.) R.Br.), were likely G. cingulata. Other hosts yielded isolates resembling G. cingulata var. minor or its imperfect state, including stock, cabbage, broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var.), alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv.), wallflower (Cheiranthus cheiri L.), oleander (Nerium oleander L.)
The extent of lesion development, even with the same organism, can vary considerably due to factors such as the variety and condition of the fruit, ambient temperature, and the history of the culture used as an inoculant. Therefore, a direct comparison of lesion sizes developed in separate series of experiments is unjustified. In the inoculations discussed here, an effort was made to include an organism known to be pathogenic to the particular host employed on each fruit. Activity was measured by the diameter of the lesion produced, and an organism was recorded as pathogenic only if this diameter was at least half of the largest lesion diameter on the examined fruit. This approach aims to eliminate smaller lesions often produced on fruit, especially if mature, by organisms that cannot be regarded strictly as pathogenic. Working on this basis, the total number of positive and negative infections obtained in the individual inoculations attempted is summarized. Inoculants are grouped according to their host of origin to provide insight into potential cross-inoculation.
The results of the artificial inoculations confirm the host range determined by field collections. Generally, a particular isolate was most active in attacking the host from which it was originally obtained. This was particularly noticeable in the case of banana and mango, which are less favored hosts except for their own normal pathogen. C. musae and the mango strain of G. cingulata var. minor also exhibited restricted activity towards hosts other than their typical ones. Conversely, papaw was susceptible to most organisms tested, which may be partly due to the absence of a fungi-toxic reaction in its skin; such a reaction can be demonstrated in banana, mango, and avocado.
Glomerella cingulata, in its typical form, has a restricted host range as a fruit pathogen in Queensland. It causes a common and characteristic ripe fruit rot of papaw and a skin blemish on passion-fruit, particularly hybrids between the purple and yellow varieties. Spore measurements, the appearance of cultures of the plus type, and the black, somewhat corrugated spot produced on papaw are all distinctive. Cultures of the sterile types tend to be somewhat nondescript and not always readily identifiable.
This specialized form of C. gloeosporioides has a wide host range and is the most commonly encountered member of the genus in Queensland. It is an important cause of ripe fruit rotting in papaw, avocado, mango, and apple, and is found less frequently injuring a number of other economic plants. C. gloeosporioides var. minor is quick-growing and develops an abundance of aerial mycelium in culture. Normal spore size is characteristic, but collections in which the size approaches the lower range for C. gloeosporioides may require cultural examination for definitive identification.
For many years, it has been apparent that two distinct forms of G. cingulata exist in Queensland. Uniting these under the same name would only obscure the many differences. Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949) encountered a Glomerella showing the same divergence from the original G. cingulata (Stonem.) S. Pauld. & Schrenk as the one under discussion. Their nomenclature for the perfect stage has been adopted and is used here. Since the perfect stage of this variety is encountered only rarely in Queensland, it is desirable for practical convenience to have a distinguishing name for the conidial state as well. Wollenweber and Hochapfel consider the imperfect state of their G. cingulata var. minor to be Gloeosporium elasticae (Thlim.) Cke. & Mass., of which they list several synonyms, mainly species occurring on fig and coffee.
Conidial measurements given by Wollenweber and Hochapfel for this species fall within the range obtained for C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland. Given the accepted synonymy of Gloeosporium with Colletotrichum, it would be inadvisable to perpetuate the former generic name. Unfortunately, Colletotrichum elasticae is already occupied by C. elasticae Tassi. Apart from the fact that a species name is not readily available, it seems preferable to designate the conidial state of a variety of G. cingulata as a variety of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. var. minor var. nov. is therefore proposed and is used in this article. A formal description appears later.
It is possible that some references in literature to G. cingulata are to organisms similar to var. minor. For example, some described by Small (1926) as Colletotrichum coffeanum Noack appear to share characters with this variety. A culture from tea in Malaya and one from avocado in Southern Rhodesia, obtained through the courtesy of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, were similar in appearance to C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland.
Colletotrichum musae (formerly Gloeosporium musarum) was originally described from Queensland material, and the organism under discussion
C. musae is the most host-specific of the organisms discussed and is notably consistent in its morphological and cultural characteristics. The conidial measurements are similar to those of C. gloeosporioides, while the cultural traits resemble those of a cultural type of C. gloeosporioides var. minor, which appears occasionally. Arx (1957) considers this fungus a host-specific form of C. gloeosporioides. It is a rapid grower with an optimal and maximum temperature range similar to that of this species. The host-parasite relationships of this organism in Queensland have been investigated in detail (Simmonds and Mitchell 1940; Simmonds 1941, 1963). The perfect state of G. cingulata has been observed sporadically from banana (Ashby 1931; Hoette 1935), but these records have not been definitively linked to Colletotrichum musae. It appears more likely that they represent a separate and less frequent association with banana, similar to the isolates from green banana fruit in Queensland.
Colletotrichum acutatum first gained attention in relation to one of the ripe fruit rots of papaw. It was later identified as the cause of a serious fruit rot in strawberries (Sturgess 1957) and a less common pathogen affecting several other hosts. The conidia of this species exhibit considerable variability in length and typically possess pointed ends. Some larger spores may be mistaken for those of C. gloeosporioides var. minor, but smaller, more typical ones are usually present as well. Occasionally, collections with abnormally long spores are found, but these commonly revert to the normal length upon sub-culturing. The cultures are characteristic and show little variation, almost invariably yielding an abundance of conidia for further confirmation. It is possible that some of the named species of Colletotrichum refer to this one. However, the brevity of older descriptions and the tendency to quote extremes rather than means for spore measurements make accurate comparisons difficult. It is not one of the eleven species of Colletotrichum currently recognized by Arx (1957). With some reluctance, the Queensland organism has therefore been described as a new species, with a formal description provided at the end of this article.
Colletotrichum orbiculare is responsible for characteristic leaf, stem, and fruit spotting in various cucurbits. It is usually thought to be pathogenic only to members of the Cucurbitaceae, but in Queensland, its ho
Mycelium in culture is copious. Conidia measure 14.0 x 3.7 µm, typically ranging from 11.1-17.7 x 3.1-5.0 µm. The species status is perithecial, identified as Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. et Schrenk var. minor Wr., which causes economic damage to the fruits of Mangifera indica L., Carica papaya L., Persea americana Mill., Malus sylvestris Mill., and many other hosts in Queensland. Colletotrichum acutatum sp. nov. features mycelium that grows slowly in culture, with parts being thin and hyaline and others being thick and dark with more pronounced septa. Chlamydospores are present. The conidia vary in length, measuring 11.1 x 3.1 µm, usually between 8.3-14.4 x 2.5-4.0 µm, and typically have pointed ends. Appressoria are predominantly obovate. This species affects the fruits of Carica papaya L., Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne, and Lycopersicon esculentum Mill. in Queensland. Diagnostic features include the small size of the conidia, variability in length within a collection, and pointed ends. On potato dextrose agar (P.D.A.), the cultural type is distinctive and relatively constant, with the colony growing moderately slowly and exhibiting an optimum temperature of 25 to 26.8 °C. The mycelium is slender and hyaline, with broader, stout, much-septate, dark mycelium appearing later. Terminal and intercalary chlamydospores of various sizes may be present; these are typically hyaline or more commonly dark when developing from the dark hyphae. On the host, conidia are produced in acervuli, and in culture, they appear to be formed throughout the mycelium, although massed conidiophores resembling acervuli may occur. Spore masses are salmon-colored and often hidden within the mycelium during culture. Setae have not been observed in association with acervuli, but poorly developed setae may occasionally appear in culture. Conidiophores are slender, two to three times the length of the spore and about half the width, or they may be shorter and stouter. Appressoria are rarely lobed, and the germ pore is often poorly defined. The host range and other characteristics of this species have been discussed in greater detail in the preceding sections. Representative dried cultures are deposited in the Herbarium of the Botany Department at the University of Queensland and in the Herbarium of the Commonwealth Mycological In
