Abstract
Fragaria × ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates that represent a worldwide sampling of the diversity of the fungus. The evidence indicates that three different species, C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, are associated with strawberry production in the UK, which correspond to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to compare aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.

Introduction
Fragaria × ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a hybrid species cultivated worldwide, belonging to the Rosaceae family. Since the 1980s, the UK strawberry industry has expanded rapidly, representing a significant component of fruit production in the country. Anthracnose is a major disease of cultivated strawberry, caused by two species complexes of the fungus referred to as C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. C. acutatum is considered the dominant cause of strawberry anthracnose and the second most important pathogen of strawberry after Botrytis cinerea. The C. gloeosporioides complex includes C. fragariae, which is now considered synonymous with a new species, C. theobromicola. However, researchers have often continued to use the name C. fragariae when referring to a pathogen associated with strawberry anthracnose. C. gloeosporioides is found only occasionally on strawberry in Europe. C. acutatum s.l. was described for the first time as a strawberry pathogen in California in 1983 and has since appeared to have spread worldwide, including the UK, through runners and propagating material. A first extensive genetic characterization of C. acutatum s.l. representing the global diversity of the pathogen led to its sub-division into genetic groups named from A1 to A9. More recently, C. acutatum s.l. has been sub-divided into more than 30 species based on multi-locus phylogeny. The first record of C. acutatum s.l. in the UK was in 1978, on Anemone sp. grown in Jersey. In 1982, the first incidence of anthracnose disease in strawberries caused by C. acutatum s.l. was recorded in the UK, attributed to the importation of infected strawberry runners from the USA. DNA sequences in public databases suggest two UK isolates (CBS198.35 and CBS199.35) that were collected in 1935 from the host Phormium spp. (common name “New Zealand flax”) belong to C. acutatum s.l. CABI database records from 1978 to 1983 show the incidence of the pathogens on various hosts and in different locations in the UK. However, it seems highly improbable that the first outbreak on strawberry led to the wide dispersal of the pathogen. In 1993, Lovelidge proposed that the continued introduction of infected strawberry material from abroad was so common that the disease was destined to become endemic in the UK. In subsequent years, further outbreaks have been reported on strawberry linked to the importation of infected propagation material, mainly from mainland Europe and on other important crop hosts. Strawberry anthracnose symptoms produced by the two Colletotrichum species complexes are similar and can be found on all parts of the plant. Flower blight and fruit rot are common symptoms in the field, whereas lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are mainly found in plant nurseries. Crown symptomatology is characterized by reddish-brown necrotic areas, and in some cases, stunting and chlorosis have been associated with root necrosis. Research has been carried out to characterize C. acutatum s.l. populations related to strawberry in specific geographic areas, including Israel, France, Bulgaria, Spain, Belgium, and others.
European countries and specific regions of the USA have contributed to research on Colletotrichum acutatum s.l. related to strawberries, using isolates collected worldwide. This research employed genomic fingerprinting techniques (such as RFLP and apPCR) and sequence analysis based on the ITS region. Results indicated the presence of at least one representative "clonal" population, suggesting a single source of origin and indicating that the disease spreads through infected propagation material. However, ITS sequences or genomic fingerprinting alone are insufficient for discriminating among newly assigned species designations. A recent study analyzing over two decades of anthracnose incidence data, gathered by plant health authorities, identified trade as the primary route of entry and establishment of C. acutatum in UK strawberry production. During this period, various nurseries imported planting material into the UK, and at least 55 cases of infested material were planted in fields without being intercepted by border inspection posts.
The present study aimed to assess the genetic and pathogenic diversity of these introduced pathogen populations, primarily utilizing a unique collection of C. acutatum s.l. isolates established through plant health inspection surveys from the early 1980s onward. We focused on C. acutatum s.l. due to previous reports from France, Israel, the UK, Bulgaria, and Spain that identified this taxon as a major widely distributed pathogen, in contrast to other species like C. gloeosporioides s.l., which occur less frequently in Europe. A range of historic and contemporary C. acutatum s.l. isolates, including those from worldwide strawberry crops and other plant hosts in the UK, were accessed as reference sources to determine the genetic and species identities of isolates associated with UK strawberry anthracnose phytosanitary control.
Based on multi-locus phylogenetic analysis, we identified 12 different haplotypes belonging to three different species: C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, suggesting multiple introductions of the strawberry anthracnose pathogen. The pathogenic and growth characteristics of these haplotype representatives further highlight the heterogeneity of the introduced pathogen populations.
A diverse collection of C. acutatum s.l. was assembled for this study, including 67 isolates associated with strawberry production in the UK (obtained from the UK Food and Environment Research Agency, responsible for plant health within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), 27 C. acutatum s.l. isolates collected from strawberries in other countries, and 13 isolates from other host species in the UK. Additionally, 33 isolates were included to represent other genetic groups and novel species from previous studies. This collection included two isolates of C. fruticola, two isolates of C. aenigma (belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex), two UK isolates of C. spinaciae, and one isolate each of C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, and C. fioriniae. Sequence data for the markers were retrieved from the reference genome sequences available for C. graminicola and C. higginsianum, used as out-groups in the phylogenetic analysis. Details of the isolate collection used in the present study are provided.
Cultures were maintained at 25°C on potato dextrose agar medium (PDA) for up to ten days under a 12 h light/12 h dark cycle. Long-term storage at 4°C involved cutting mycelial plugs from the edge of actively growing cultures on PDA and suspending them in sterile water.
Genomic DNA was extracted according to the Chelex 100 protocol, with some modifications. DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer. Various target regions were used to characterize genetic diversity among the fungal isolates, including the ITS region, a partial sequence of the beta-tubulin 2 gene (TUB) (exons 3 through 6, including introns 2 through 4), a partial sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, and a partial sequence of the mating type gene (MAT1-2) (the intron included in the conserved HMG box region). Target regions were amplified using PCR reaction mixes (20 μl) that contained 1 μl of DNA, 1 μl each of primer (20 μM), 7 μl of H2O, and 10 μl of ReadyMix RedTaq.
PCR amplification of the target regions for sequencing was carried out using previously published primers under conditions standardized for routine work. For ITS, primers ITS1Ext and ITS4Ext were used. The amplification program consisted of 2 min of initial denaturation (95°C), 30 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 55°C, and 1 min at 72°C), and a final extension at 72°C for 5 min. For TUB, primers TB5 and TB6 were used with the same initial denaturation and final extension as for ITS, but with 30 cycles of amplification at 1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 65°C, and 1 min at 72°C. For GAPDH, primers GDF1 and GDR1 were used with an amplification program of 2 min initial denaturation at 95°C, 35 cycles of amplification (1 min at 94°C, 1 min at 60°C, and 30 sec at 72°C), and a final extension at 72°C for 3 min. For MAT1-2, primers HMGacuF2 and HMGacuR were used for C. acutatum s.l., and primers HMGgloeF1 and HMGgloeR1 for C. gloeosporioides s.l. The amplification program for MAT1-2 consisted of 5 min initial denaturation at 95°C, 40 cycles of amplification (1 min at 95°C, 1 min between 48°C and 55°C, and 30 sec at 72°C), followed by a final extension of 20 min at 72°C.
PCR products were separated using gel electrophoresis and purified using the QIAquick PCR purification kit. Sequencing of PCR products was carried out at the University of Warwick Genomics Centre, using an ABI Prism 7900HT or ABI3100 sequence detection system. PCR products were cleaned and quantified with reference to a ladder containing DNA fragments of known concentration. One to five microliters of each sample, depending on DNA concentration, were used in sequencing reactions with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit. ABI trace files were analyzed and consensus sequences were generated using Geneious. All sequences were aligned using MUSCLE and were manually edited to optimize the alignment as required. Multiple alignments were end-trimmed to ensure comparable nucleotides. Multiple sequence alignments were exported to MEGA5, where best-fit substitution models were calculated for each separate sequence dataset. To evaluate whether the four sequ
Neighbour-Joining bootstrap and maximum parsimony analyses (100,000 replicates) were separately performed for each gene and visually compared. The multilocus concatenated alignment (ITS, TUB2, MAT1-2, and GAPDH) was performed with Geneious 7.1.6. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes 3.2.1 for combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene, determined by MEGA5, were included for each locus. The analysis in MrBayes ran for 5,000,000 generations to reach a P value lower than 0.01 with two parallel searches using three heated and one cold Markov chain sampled every 100 generations; 25% of generations were discarded as burn-in. Further phylogenetic analysis was performed by constructing a Bayesian MCMC analysis tree from the alignment based on the concatenation of rRNA, TUB, MAT1-2, and GAPDH partial sequences of 140 Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato isolates used in this study. The tree was rooted with sequences from C. graminicola and C. higginsianum retrieved from whole genome sequences, as well as sequences of four C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and two C. spinaciae obtained experimentally. Isolates used to investigate variation in aggressiveness are highlighted in bold.

Comparison of Fungal Growth in Culture
The 67 fungal isolates collected from strawberries in the UK were compared with a subset of other isolates (chosen based on genetic, host, and geographic diversity), including 49 isolates of C. acutatum s.l. and four isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.l., for in vitro growth studies on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar). For the experiments, a 7 mm diameter mycelial plug excised from the edge of an actively growing PDA culture was placed at the center of a fresh PDA plate. In the growth experiment, two perpendicular colony diameters were measured daily, and colony radius was calculated from cultures incubated at four different temperatures (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C) in darkness. Data corresponding to the linear growth phase were subjected to analysis of variance of regression to create growth curves for each isolate at each temperature. In both tests, three plates were used as replicates. Statistical analysis was performed using the SIGMAPLOT 10 program. Colony characteristics were recorded after 15 days of incubation at 25°C under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Pathogenicity Tests
Representative isolates (highlighted with asterisks) of each C. acutatum s.l. group isolated from strawberries in the UK, along with reference isolates from other hosts, were used for pathogenicity tests on the generally susceptible strawberry cultivar Elsanta. A conidial suspension was prepared for each isolate by flooding 10-day-old PDA culture plates with sterile deionized water. Spore concentration was adjusted to 10^5 spores ml^-1 for fruit inoculation and 10^6 spores ml^-1 for crown inoculation. Unripe fruits (white fruit beginning to turn pink) were inoculated with a 5 μl drop of conidial suspension. Before inoculation, fruit surfaces were disinfected for 5 minutes using NaClO (1% active chlorine) in 50% ethanol, washed three times in sterilized water, blotted dry, and placed in a tray with moist sand on the bottom to prevent movement during further procedures. After inoculation, fruits were incubated at 25°C under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. Disease symptoms were evaluated 7 days after inoculation by recording the incidence of disease (percentage of infected fruits) and the aggressiveness of lesion development using the following severity scale: 0, no visible lesions; 1, lesions on less than 33% of fruit surface; 2, lesions covering 33–66% of fruit surface; and 3, lesions covering more than 66% of fruit surface. Three fruits inoculated with sterile distilled water, as well as fresh fruits, served as non-inoculated controls. Four independent replicates were tested for each fungal isolate, consisting of three inoculated fruits for each replicate. At the end of the experiment, Colletotrichum isolates were re-isolated from infected fruits and cultured on PDA to confirm colony characteristics.
The capability of the isolates to produce crown rot symptoms was evaluated by injecting the crowns of three-month-old strawberry plants with 0.2 mL conidial suspension using a syringe. The plants were placed in a glasshouse at 23°C with a light cycle of 16 hours light and 8 hours darkness. After 24 days, the plants were evaluated for the presence of crown tissues with red-brownish discoloration, wilting, and collapse, which are typical symptoms of Colletotrichum crown rot. The severity was assessed using the following scale: 0 for no lesions; 1 for crown tissue discoloration without wilting or collapse; 2 for wilting or collapse of part of the plant; and 3 for plant death. The crowns of all plants were sectioned and examined for red-brownish lesions. Crown infection was confirmed by re-isolation of the pathogen. Three plant crowns injected with sterile distilled water, as well as untouched plants, served as negative controls for each replicate. The experiment was independently replicated three times, with six plants for each replicate. Values of disease severity were used to calculate a Disease Index (DI) as the average severity, using the formula: Svn/N, where v represents the numeric value of the class, n is the number of plants assigned to the class, and N is the total number of plants assessed. Data from pathogenicity tests on both fruits and plants were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA), and means were compared using Tukey’s multiple range test.
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using combined ITS, TUB2, GADPH, and MAT1-2 sequence data sets consisting of 148 Colletotrichum isolates. Most of the C. acutatum s.l. isolates (49 out of 67) were identified as belonging to C. nymphaeae (A2 genetic group), based on clustering with high bootstrap values alongside reference isolates. A smaller proportion of isolates in the diversity collection (12 out of 67) were identified as C. godetiae (A4 genetic group), and six isolates were identified as C. fioriniae (A3 genetic group) based on genetic clustering with reference isolates.
UK, along with the reference isolates representing host and geographic diversity, suggests that there have been multiple introductions of the anthracnose pathogen belonging to different Colletotrichum species into the country. Three different species, C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, were identified based on sequences from four loci. The incidence of these species shows that C. nymphaeae corresponds to 73%, followed by C. godetiae (18%) and C. fioriniae (9%). GAPDH is the locus that shows the highest variability across the nucleotide dataset, with 24.1% identical sites for the entire data set (including out-groups) and 59.3% within C. acutatum s.l. The MAT1-2 gene also shows high variability, with 34.4% identical sites, of which 78.6% is in C. acutatum s.l. TUB and ITS loci show lower percentages of variable sites; specifically, TUB has 58.1% of identical sites in the final alignment and 80.7% when only considering C. acutatum s.l., while ITS has 77.8% and 92.4% of conserved nucleotides, respectively, with and without out-groups. Based on the nucleotide variability described above, four haplotypes of C. nymphaeae, three haplotypes of C. fioriniae, and five haplotypes of C. godetiae were identified, further highlighting the multiple introductions of the pathogens belonging to these species into the UK.
Radial growth data of C. acutatum s.l. and C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates were subjected to analysis of variance of regression to obtain growth curves, all statistically significant (R² = 0.9447 and P < 0.0001), with one exception showing R² = 0.770 (C. nymphaeae CSL224 at 30°C). The slope for each isolate (with three replicates) belonging to the same species was averaged to detect the hypothetical optimal growth temperature. Almost all species, particularly those containing isolates from strawberry in the UK, namely C. nymphaeae, C. fioriniae, and C. godetiae, had the highest growth rates at 25°C, considered the optimum temperature. It is pertinent to mention that higher levels of strawberry anthracnose incidence in the UK have been reported in the southwest and southeast regions, where relatively high temperatures are often reached. However, C. phormii, C. kinghormii, and C. rhombiforme showed the highest growth rate at 20°C and were unable to grow at 30°C. These three species are evolutionarily closely related, suggesting specific adaptations to different environmental conditions compared to other members of the same complex.
Regarding C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates (C. aenigma CSL780 and CSL 869; C. fruticola CSL 311 and CSL386), used as out-groups, all four isolates showed the highest growth rate at all tested temperatures compared with all other isolates. C. nymphaeae isolates developed white cottony aerial mycelium and light brownish conidial masses, with colony colors ranging from dark grey to dark brown. Twelve isolates belonging to C. godetiae were characterized by white aerial mycelium and yellow pigmentation to white on the reverse side of the culture. C. fioriniae isolates appeared dark red on the reverse side of the cultures with orange conidial masses in large drops on the colony surface, and conidiomata formed directly on the hyphae. However, these characters are often difficult to describe reliably and can change following sub-culturing or based on the length and type of storage. Thus, there is a need for further development of molecular methods for reliable and rapid diagnosis and monitoring of pathogen populations belonging to different species associated with strawberry production in specific geographic locations.
Characterisation of variation in pathogenicity
Thirty-four C. acutatum s.l. isolates were chosen for pathogenicity tests on fruits and plants, including six representative isolates from each of the three species related to strawberry production in the UK, and one or more isolates representative of all the major species of the C. acutatum complex. Four C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates, which were isolated from strawberry-infected tissues from the UK and USA, were included in the experiments as an out-group. C. acutatum s.l. isolates varied in aggressiveness on both host tissues. In the fruit assays, among the three species identified from the strawberry production systems in the UK, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae were more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This was particularly noticeable for isolates originating from strawberry, as reflected by the fruit disease index range for C. nymphaeae (2.08–3.00), C. fioriniae (1.92–2.75), and C. godetiae (0.75–2.08). Interestingly, with isolates originating from other hosts, C. nymphaeae isolates were less aggressive (0.67–1.67), and one or more isolates belonging to C. fioriniae (2.00–2.17) as well as C. godetiae (2.17) showed a fruit disease index in the range of the strawberry isolates. Among the other species tested within the C. acutatum complex, C. acutatum s.s., C. simmondsii, and Colletotrichum sp. 2 included one or more isolates originating from non-strawberry hosts that showed medium levels of aggressiveness with fruit disease indices ranging from 1.17 to 2.08. In contrast, C. lupini (0.08–0.75), C. phormii (0.58), C. salicis (0.17–0.67), and C. rhombiforme (0.67) along with Colletotrichum sp. 1 (0.33) isolates originating from various hosts other than strawberry were much less aggressive as reflected by the fruit disease index. The C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates tested showed a fruit disease index ranging from 1.50 to 2.50.
The data on radial growth rates of different Colletotrichum species at various temperatures were detailed in a table, presenting growth rates in mm/h at 15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C. Each species exhibited different average growth rates, with C. aenigma showing the highest at 0.261 mm/h at 25°C, while several species, such as C. kinghornii and C. rhombiforme, had notably lower growth rates at higher temperatures. The optimal growth temperature for each species was indicated in bold.
In the in vitro assays, anthracnose fruit rot symptoms were observed for various isolates tested with different levels of aggressiveness, as shown by the disease index ranging from 0.08 to 3.0. The variation in aggressiveness among different isolates was clearly reflected by the differences in incidence, which ranged from 8.33% to 100%, with only 4 out of 38 isolates showing 91.7% to 100%. The lesion types varied, with a range from 0.1 to 3.0. When lesion morphology was evaluated, different kinds of lesions could be distinguished on fruits, ranging from brown lesions containing orange drops of conidia to those entirely covered with aerial mycelium, varying in size. C. nymphaeae CSL899 was the most aggressive on strawberry fruits, with the highest disease index (3.0), corresponding to symptoms covering more than 66% of the fruit surface. In the plant assays, varying degrees of crown rot symptoms were recorded 24 days after inoculation, reflected by the disease index range. Symptom severity was generally low, with no isolate scoring higher than 2, indicating wilting and collapse of the plant. Among the three species identified from UK strawberry production systems, C. fioriniae isolates originating from strawberry showed a higher range of disease index (0.72–1.00) compared to C. nymphaeae (0.5–0.83) and C. godetiae (0.39–0.67). The C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolate CSL 311 (C. fruticola from strawberry in the USA) showed the highest disease index (1.6) and was also among the most aggressive on fruit. Colletotrichum isolates were recovered from all crowns showing symptoms.
The UK strawberry industry has expanded rapidly in recent years, which appears to correlate with increasing losses attributed to anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. This study provides the first molecular characterization of C. acutatum sensu lato diversity related to strawberry production in the UK, combined with pathogenic characterization. A collection of 148 isolates representative of UK and global diversity of C. acutatum s.l. populations has been assembled. The isolates were chosen based on host association, geographic distribution, phylogenetic relationships, and biological diversity. Based on four sequence loci (ITS, TUB, GAPDH, and MAT1-2), the C. acutatum sensu lato isolates were assigned to three newly designated species: C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, following a recent taxonomic reassessment. According to available literature, C. nymphaeae is the most common, and C. godetiae is often reported in European and American strawberry fields. These two species were also the most representative in our dataset of isolates related to strawberry in the UK. C. fioriniae has a worldwide distribution and is common on strawberry, but only a few isolates were identified in our collection, and this group was not commonly present in the fields in the UK.
In a detailed examination of the variability in aggressiveness of Colletotrichum species isolates on strawberry fruits and plants, several isolates were evaluated. For example, C. nymphaeae isolate CSL 899 from the UK exhibited the highest fruit disease index of 3.00, indicating severe symptoms, while its plant disease index was 0.83. Other isolates, such as CSL 256 and CSL 915, showed moderate disease indices for fruit, ranging from 2.08 to 2.50, while their corresponding plant disease indices were relatively low, indicating lower severity of crown rot symptoms. Overall, the assessment highlighted the differences in aggressiveness

The pathogenicity assays used in this work are based on a study in Belgium, considering the similar molecular diversity of the anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays with the isolates representing the molecular diversity not only revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species described within C. acutatum s.l. but also complex patterns both between and within the species. For example, based on isolates originating from strawberry, C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae appear equally aggressive on fruits, with C. nymphaeae isolates indicating a degree of host preference. Both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included isolates from other hosts that showed comparable levels of aggressiveness to isolates from strawberry. A similar situation was observed with at least some non-strawberry isolates belonging to species such as C. acutatum s.s. and C. simmondsii. Furthermore, at least one C. godetiae isolate from strawberry was much less aggressive compared to others. These patterns suggest that some Colletotrichum species, such as C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, include populations that are capable of infecting a wider range of hosts, also influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies using a wider set of isolates of these three species and appropriate pathological and biological assays are required to gain additional insights into the evolution of pathogenicity in relation to field symptoms, as well as any differential responses to host varieties and fungicides locally used in UK strawberry production systems. The study has highlighted the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the introduced anthracnose pathogen populations belonging to three different Colletotrichum species, emphasizing the need for effective phytosanitary procedures linked to pathogen monitoring and characterization to generally limit the entry of non-native pathogens. This also underlines the requirement for reliable and rapid diagnostic tools for further research and application in strawberry anthracnose management. The recent release of a whole genome sequence of C. fioriniae isolated from strawberry, along with the newly characterized isolates based on multi-locus sequence and aggressiveness information reported here, represents a useful platform for further research into the genetic basis of C. acutatum s.l.—strawberry interactions.
The variability in aggressiveness of Colletotrichum species isolates on strawberry fruits and plants is detailed as follows: a scale is used where 0 indicates no visible lesions, 1 indicates lesions on less than 33% of the fruit surface, 2 indicates lesions covering 33–66% of the fruit surface, and 3 indicates lesions covering more than 66% of the fruit surface. For plant assessment, the scale ranges from no lesions (0), to crown tissue discoloration without wilting or collapse (1), to wilting or collapse of part of the plant (2), and ultimately to plant death (3).
