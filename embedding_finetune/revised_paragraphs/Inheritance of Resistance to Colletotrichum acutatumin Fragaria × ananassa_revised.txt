ABSTRACT
Denoyes-Rothan, B., Guérin, G., Lerceteau-Köhler, E., and Risser, G. 2005. Inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum in Fragaria × ananassa. Phytopathology 95:405-412. Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, is a major disease of the octoploid cultivated strawberry, Fragaria × ananassa. The inheritance of high and intermediate levels of plant resistance to C. acutatum, pathogenicity group 2, was investigated using an 8 × 8 factorial design. A single dominant gene (Rca2) was found to control high-level resistance, although minor genes may also contribute to resistance in cultivars such as Belrubi. The intermediate level of resistance was quantitative and controlled by minor genes. Analysis of 26 genotypes and cultivars from Fragaria spp. revealed that the dominant gene was not rare in the germplasm of F. × ananassa, and that anthracnose resistance was also present in other species of Fragaria. These findings have significant implications for anthracnose resistance breeding. Additional keywords: host–pathogen interaction, major gene.
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds, is a major disease of cultivated strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) in Europe, where C. acutatum is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. Symptoms manifest on all parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. No chemical disease control methods are available to effectively manage the disease. Among cultural techniques, drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels considerably limit inoculum dispersal, thus reducing fruit losses. The use of pathogen-free plants produced according to a certification scheme usually provides a level of disease control. However, latent infections may occur in seemingly healthy plants, leading to anthracnose losses in production fields. Therefore, the development of str
In a preliminary study, four crosses (Valeta × Selva, Addie × Sequoia, and their reciprocal crosses Selva × Valeta and Sequoia × Addie) were examined to test reciprocal effects. Since all these crosses segregated clearly in a 1:1 ratio (P > 0.05), a factorial scheme was chosen to study the inheritance of anthracnose resistance. By using different parents as female and male, this scheme allows for the analysis of a broader genetic base compared with that of diallel design. The 16 cultivars used in the factorial crossing scheme (8 × 8) were assigned randomly as male or female parents. The authors credited with reporting the resistance of these cultivars in the literature are also noted, along with the level of resistance according to preliminary or reported results. The inheritance of resistance in cv. Addie was studied by inoculating with C. acutatum S2 families derived from the selfing of random individuals taken from the S1 generation. The presence of anthracnose resistance to pathogenicity group 2 was evaluated by inoculating 26 accessions, including 23 F. × ananassa genotypes of various geographic origins, one F. moschata genotype, and two F. vesca genotypes. Finally, the presence of identical or different genes controlling anthracnose resistance in cvs. Capitola and Chandler was analyzed by studying families derived from the complex cross [(Capitola × Chandler) × Pajaro]. Crosses (F1, first filial generation) and selfings (S1, selfing parental generation and S2, selfing S1 generation) were protected from cross-pollination by covering buds with polyethylene bags.
Seeds were germinated in the greenhouse with a 16-hour photoperiod using supplementary incandescent light and a day temperature of 24 ± 6°C and night temperature of 18 ± 4°C. Four to six weeks after sowing, seedlings were transplanted to 72-cell plug trays (one plant per 5 × 5 cm well) containing peat/vermiculite substrate (1:1 by volume). The monoconidial isolate 688b of the C. acutatum pathogenicity group 2 was used for inoculum. The stock culture was maintained in cryoconservation. Each year, this strain was recovered from diseased plants of cv. Elsanta to revive its pathogenicity. Seedlings were inoculated when the first two true leaves were fully developed, approximately 3 to 4 weeks after planting in the tray. They were inoculated by spraying the leaf surfaces until runoff with a conidial suspension adjusted to 3 × 10^6 conidia per milliliter. After inoculation, the seedlings were maintained in plastic boxes for two weeks in a controlled environment growth chamber wit

The Pajaro-S1 progeny was included as a susceptible control in all inoculation tests of the factorial scheme. Moreover, Elsanta-S1, Addie-S1, Sequoia-S1, and/or Dover-S1 progenies were used as a range of controls in the other studies.
In the study of the 8 × 8 factorial design, at least 80 seedlings were inoculated for each of the 64 crosses and for the S1 progeny of the 16 parents, except for Darestival × Pajaro, Hokowase × Pajaro, Hokowase × Belrubi, Hokowase × Dover, Elsanta-S1, and Rosanne-S1, where 49, 44, 59, 78, 58, and 48 seedlings were inoculated, respectively. A total of five inoculation experiments were performed, and most selfings or crosses were assessed in at least two distinct inoculation experiments. For studying the inheritance of the 26 diverse accessions, at least 40 S1 seedlings were inoculated, except for cv. Madame Moutot (24 seedlings). For examining the inheritance of the intermediate resistance of cv. Addie, one S1 and eight S2 progeny were inoculated.
For studying segregation in a Mendelian approach, seedlings were grouped into two classes: the resistant class (R) corresponding to [R] and the susceptible class (S) corresponding to [MS] and [VS]. Segregation ratios of S1 and cross populations were tested for goodness-of-fit to theoretical ratios for the hypothesis that a single locus with one dominant allele controls resistance. Since seedlings may escape inoculation (mean of 3% on the eight susceptible S1 cvs. Yolo, Elsanta, Darestival, Pajaro, Fern, Hokowase, Valeta, and HummiGento) or die for other reasons than anthracnose, the segregation ratios 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) and 1:0 (resistant/susceptible) were tested as 3:97 (resistant/susceptible) and 97:3 (resistant/susceptible). Tests were performed on the segregating populations using numerical data. The chi-square (χ²) test was used for the segregation ratio 3:1 and 1:1. The likelihood ratio chi-square test (G²), which can be performed using a small number of observations (3), was used for the segregation ratios 0:1 and 1:0 (3:97 and 97:3, respectively). For comparing the disease incidence means of S1 and crosses derived from the susceptible or moderately susceptible parents, a least-squares means
The results indicated the inheritance patterns of anthracnose resistance among various cultivars. For the six intercrosses between resistant cultivars that segregated in a 3:1 ratio, only one (Chandler × Selva) showed significant results (P = 0.002). The S1 progeny from cv. Dover exhibited a 1:0 (resistant/susceptible) segregation ratio, suggesting that the dosage of the resistant dominant allele is at least two (double dose or duplex). This was further supported by the eight F1 crosses involving cv. Dover, which also confirmed the presence of a multidose resistant allele, segregating in a 1:0 ratio, except for two crosses that were significant at P > 0.01.
In the simplest hypothesis of a multidose configuration in cv. Dover, the resistance gene could be observed in disomic (RR rr rr rr), tetrasomic (RRrr rrrr), or octosomic (RRrrrrrr) segregation patterns through test crosses and selfing. The results did not support octosomic inheritance, as probabilities of χ² were lower than 0.05, except for HummiGento × Dover. The segregation patterns observed in other cultivars like Belrubi-S1, which showed 84.4% resistant seedlings, did not conform to expected 3:1 or 1:0 ratios, indicating an excess of resistant genotypes.
Regarding susceptible cultivars such as Darestival, Elsanta, Fern, Hokowase, HummiGento, Pajaro, Valeta, and Yolo, the S1 progenies exhibited very low percentages of resistant genotypes (from 0.0 to 8.8% with a mean of 3%), aligning with the hypothesis of a 0:1 segregation ratio. Intercross populations followed this same trend, reinforcing the absence of a dominant resistance gene.
In the case of partial resistance, the observed segregation pattern of cv. Addie did not fit standard ratios, suggesting a continuous frequency of disease response. Utilizing the LS mean test, the mean disease responses of populations derived from cv. Addie were significantly lower than those of selfings of susceptible cultivars and lower than intercrosses between these cultivars. Additionally, disease responses of several Addie-S2 families were significantly lower than those of Addie-S1, indicating that the partial resistance in cv. Addie is likely controlled oligogenically.
The segregation ratios of the S1 families from 26 accessions in response to isolate 688b further elucidated the inheritance of anthracnose resistance, providing insights into
Osogrande, Revada, Senga Sengana, and Seascape, from genotypes US438 and US70, and from F. moschata FM1 were statistically similar to the segregation ratio of Sequoia-S1 and consistent with the hypothesis of a heterozygous locus controlling the high level of resistance. The segregation ratios of the S1 families from genotypes US159 and US292, as well as from both genotypes of F. vesca, Reine des Vallées and Rodluvan, were similar to the S1 from Dover, indicating they are homozygous for the resistance locus. The segregation ratios of the S1 families from cultivars Bogota, CF1116, CF129, Darselect, and Earliglow were similar to the S1 from Elsanta and did not display the dominant allele. Like cv. Addie, cv. Ostara exhibited too high a level of resistant seedlings, supporting the hypothesis of the absence of resistance components.
To determine if the dominant locus controlling the high level of resistance is the same across resistant genotypes, a study was conducted using two cultivars, Capitola and Chandler, both heterozygous for the resistance locus. First, cv. Capitola was crossed with cv. Chandler, and individuals from this progeny were then crossed with the homozygous susceptible cv. Pajaro. If the resistance gene is the same in cvs. Capitola and Chandler, families from the crosses [(Capitola × Chandler) × Pajaro] would show segregation ratios of 1:0 (resistant/susceptible), 1:1 (resistant/susceptible), and 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) in 25%, 50%, and 25% of the families, respectively. Conversely, if the resistance gene differs between cvs. Capitola and Chandler, families from the crosses would segregate with ratios of 3:1 (resistant/susceptible), 1:1 (resistant/susceptible), and 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) for 25%, 50%, and 25% of the families, respectively. Among the 21 families analyzed from the crosses [(Capitola × Chandler) × Pajaro], nine families segregated 0:1, 11 families segregated 1:1, and one family segregated 1:0, supporting the hypothesis of a common major gene in cvs. Capitola and Chandler (P = 0.05).
This paper reports the inheritance of plant resistance to pathogenicity group 2 of C. acutatum, the causative agent of anthracnose disease in strawberries, based on the level of resistance. A major dominant gene controls the high level of resistance. This dominant gene is widely present in the collection of European cultivars studied, such as Mamie, Gariguette, and Belrubi, as well as in U.S. cultivars like Sequoia, Dover, and US159. The narrow genetic basis of the cultivated strawberry suggests that few origins of the resistance are involved, consistent with the observation of resistance being controlled by the same gene in cvs. Capitola and Chandler. Other species of Fragaria have displayed resistance to C. acutatum, as observed in two genotypes of F. vesca and one of F. moschata. Anthra

Rca2 follows the suggested nomenclature for resistance gene loci and applies to the first resistance gene described in strawberries by Van de Weg. The number 2 indicates the effectiveness of the resistance factor to the isolates of pathogenicity group 2 described in 1995. Minor genes control an intermediate level of resistance, which has been reported in the cultivar Addie. This intermediate level is quantitative and controlled by a complex of minor genes. In cv. Addie, these minor genes may partially exhibit dominant effects, as three crosses between cv. Addie and susceptible cultivars showed similar segregation patterns to the Addie-S1 progeny. The observation of an excess of resistant seedlings in progenies from crosses between cv. Belrubi and susceptible cultivars, compared to the expected 50% from a single dominant gene, further supports the presence of minor genes with partial dominance in cv. Belrubi. In cv. Addie, transgressive lines of S2 display a higher level of resistance than the Addie-S1 progeny, making the intermediate level of resistance useful in breeding programs for anthracnose resistance. Additionally, this quantitative resistance is expected to function in a non-race-specific manner, providing durable resistance according to Van der Plank. This aligns with the observed efficiency of resistance in cv. Addie against isolates from both pathogenicity groups.
When comparing the resistance genotype characterized in seedlings with the fruit resistance previously described, it was noted that all genotypes possessing the dominant gene (homozygous or heterozygous), along with cv. Addie, which carries minor genes, exhibited intermediate or high levels of fruit resistance. In contrast, all genotypes lacking the dominant allele of resistance, except cv. Selva, showed no fruit resistance. Therefore, fruit resistance appears to be partially controlled by the dominant gene, but not exclusively.
A figure shows frequency distributions of disease responses for selfed progeny (S1) of three cultivars: Pajaro (susceptible), Chandler (resistant), and Addie (intermediate). The disease responses are rated from 0 (resistant) to 5 (highly susceptible).
In the analysis of segregation ratios of the dominant resistance gene in a duplex status in cv. Dover across various inheritance models, several test crosses were conducted with different susceptible cultivars. The table detailed specific behaviors in disomic, tetrasomic, and octosomic inheritance for various crosses, with results indicating the number of plants observed and the calculated ratios for resistant to susceptible classes. Probability values were also provided for the chi-square tests performed on the expected ratios, allowing for an evaluation of goodness of fit in the data.
A solid understanding of host–pathogen interaction is critical to designing an efficient breeding program for disease resistance, which is the lower-cost option for controlling anthracnose in strawberry. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be incorporated to construct a resistance that is widely effective since the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1. A selection scheme was proposed to breeders in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum, pathogenicity group 1, is selected on seedlings at the beginning of selection, and the plant resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected later after vegetative multiplication on cold-stored plants. Studies focused on molecular markers linked to these different components of resistance would provide a better understanding of the resistance and help in the choice of parents for anthracnose resistance.

A solid understanding of host–pathogen interactions is critical for designing an efficient breeding program aimed at disease resistance, which represents a cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. To develop a broadly effective resistance, it is essential to incorporate genetic components of resistance against both pathogenicity groups, as dominant resistant genes may be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1. A proposed selection scheme suggests that breeders select for likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum, pathogenicity group 1, in seedlings at the start of the selection process. Later, after vegetative multiplication on cold-stored plants, selection for resistance to pathogenicity group 2—conferred by a dominant gene—should occur. Research focusing on molecular markers linked to these various resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance mechanisms and aid in selecting suitable genitors for anthracnose resistance.

Parental lines and crosses are ranked according to the mean of disease response. S1 refers to the generation obtained by selfing the parental cultivar; S2 is the second selfing generation from the parental cultivar. The total number of inoculated plants is noted. The three susceptible classes are expressed as percentages of seedlings recorded: from 0 to 0.5 for the resistant class (R), from 1 to 2.5 for the moderately susceptible class (MR), and from 3 to 5 for the very susceptible class (VS). Notations are evaluated 28 days after inoculation. Disease response means with the same letters do not differ significantly according to the least squares (LS) means test at P = 0.001.
TABLE 7 describes the fruit resistance (disease incidence) and genotype for plant resistance of 22 strawberry cultivars to Colletotrichum acutatum pathogenicity group 2. The table categorizes cultivars based on their disease incidence (DI) percentages and resistance genotypes. For susceptible cultivars, Pajaro has the highest DI at 100%, followed closely by Elsanta at 98% and Valeta at 96%. Intermediate susceptible cultivars include Seascape at 71% and Gariguette at 63%. Partial resistance is seen in Addie at 33%, while the resistant group includes Capitola with a DI of 17% and Dover at 16%. The disease incidence is calculated as the percentage of fruit showing an anthracnose lesion eight days after inoculation. A likelihood ratio chi-square test (G2) was performed on the distribution of fruit in two classes based on the presence or absence of a lesion, with values sharing the same letters indicating no significant difference (P < 0.001). The plant resistance genotype is controlled by a dominant gene in a diploid configura
