Over 90% of strawberry 15 cultivation is in Miaoli County, with ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ as the predominant cultivar for 16 more than 30 years. Anthracnose has become more destructive over the past decade. 17 Although Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum 18 were mentioned as the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan (Plant 19 Protection Information System; https://otserv2.tactri.gov.tw/ppm/), we lack 20 information on the isolation, pathogenicity, morphological or molecular identification 21 of the pathogen. From 2010 to 2016, we surveyed anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli 22 County; more than 50% of diseased plants showed typical anthracnose crown rot (ACR) 23 symptoms (McInnes et al. 1992). ACR caused up to 30 to 40% plant loss during the 24 seedling stage and ~20% after transplanting. Infected crown tissue initially showed red 25 and white marbling, then gradually brown rot, followed by rapid wilting of the entire 26 plant. Anthracnose symptoms were observed in other parts of the plant, including leaves, 27 petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. Symptoms appeared as circular black spots on the 28 leaves and withering and girdling on runners. To isolate the causal agent, approximately 29 0.2 × 0.2-cm fragments of diseased crowns were surface-disinfested with 1% sodium 30 hypochlorite, triple rinsed with sterile water, then placed onto 1.5% water agar. After 2 31 to 3 days, extended single hyphal tips from tissues were transferred to potato dextrose 32 agar and incubated for 7 days at 25°C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. Colonies were 33 initially white, later became somewhat zonate, velvety, light gray on the upper side and 34 gray on the reverse side of plates, with concentric rings of salmon sporodochia. Conidia 35 were 9.68 to 17.95 × 3.88 to 5.84 µm (14.53 ± 0.31 × 4.99 ± 0.08 µm, n = 90), hyaline, 36 oblong to cylindrical, with round obtuse ends. Morphological characteristics of the 37 causal agent resembled species belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex 38 (Weir et al. 2012). To confirm the species identification, we extracted genomic DNA Page 1 of 4Pl an t D is ea se  "

T he  f in al  p ub lis he d ve rs io n m ay  d if fe r. mailto:sst@ntu.edu.tw https://otserv2.tactri.gov.tw/ppm/ 39 from 10 isolates by using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System 40 (Viogene, Taipei) and PCR-amplified the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, 41 chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), β-tubulin 2 (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL) and 42 intergenic region of Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT) with published primers (Carbone 43 and Kohn 1999; O'Donnell and Cigelnik 1997; Silva et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012; White 44 et al. 1990). Sequences were submitted to GenBank [accession nos. MK174223 (ITS), 45 MK174224 (CHS-1), MK174225 (ACT), MK174226 (TUB2), MK174227 (CAL) and 46 MK174228 (ApMAT)]. The ITS, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT sequences 47 were compared to the GenBank nr database, restricted to type material. Results showed 48 98 to 99% identity to C. siamense (syn. C. dianesei and C. melanocaulon) (Liu et al. 49 2016; Prihastuti et al. 2009), which belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 50 with the corresponding sequences [ITS: NR_144800; CHS-1: KX094094; ApMAT: 51 KX094304 (Lima et al. 2013); ACT: KX093987; TUB2: KX094290; CAL: KX094036 52 (Doyle et al. 2013)]. Koch’s postulates were fulfilled for two isolates (ML133 and 53 ML612) by spraying 1×106 conidia/mL suspension on seedlings until run-off at the 4 54 to 5 leaf stage (two trials per isolate, n = 5 seedlings per trial). Inoculated plants were 55 covered with plastic bags (> 90% RH) for 24 h at 30°C, then maintained in a growth 56 chamber at 30°C, 70% RH under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. After 7 days, all inoculated 57 plants showed typical necrotic leaf spots and wilt symptoms similar to those in the field. 58 Control plants sprayed with sterile water had no symptoms (n = 5 per trial). 59 Longitudinal sections of the inoculated crown showed reddish-brown and white 60 marbled necrosis. The fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased leaves or crowns 61 with 100% frequency (n ≥ 3 isolates per trial), and morphological characteristics and 62 gene sequences were identical to the original isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first 63 report of C. siamense causing ACR of strawberry in Taiwan. The disease has the 64 potential for causing serious losses to the strawberry industry in Taiwan, and research 65 is needed on management strategies to minimize losses.
