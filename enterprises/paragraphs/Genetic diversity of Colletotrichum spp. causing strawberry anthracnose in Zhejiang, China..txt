Anthracnose is a serious fungal disease that primarily infects strawberry roots and stolons during development. Here, 91 isolates from different areas of Zhejiang province, China, were collected. Morphological characteristics were analyzed, and a phylogenetic analysis based on multiple genes (actin, internal transcribed spacer, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) was performed. We found that all of theColletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose belonged to the Colletotrichum gloeospor ioides complex. Among them, we identified 48 isolates of C. fructicola, 21 isolates of C. siamense, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides, and 9 iso lates of C. aenigma. C. siamensewas distributed in the central and east ern regions of Zhejiang province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, 
Ningbo, and Taizhou). This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province. C. fructicola was the most dominant species causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province. We identified the four species causing strawberry anthrac nose in Zhejiang province, which will improve our understanding of the strawberry anthracnose epidemic and will benefit the development of future control measures.

Strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa), which are native to South
America, are widely cultivated in China (Henz et al. 1992). The area devoted to strawberry cultivation increased from 90,100 ha in 1985 to 330,000 ha in 2012; China produces 35.7% of all strawberries worldwide, and it is the largest producer of strawberries globally (Peng and Peng 2011). Zhejiang province is the one of the top eight strawberry-producing regions in China (Shen 2014).
Strawberry anthracnose is a serious fungal disease that can affect plants at any stage during their lifecycle (Henz et al. 1992). How ever, plants are most susceptible to strawberry anthracnose at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008).
Anthracnose primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and sto lons, but flowers and fruit can also be infected, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms are irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish brown stolons during the initial stages of stolon development, leaves and petioles with black spindle shaped lesions, wilt, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of all seedling deaths and >40% of all production losses in the nursery are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). During the entire plant growth cycle, strawberry was threatened by anthracnose disease. If environmental conditions are suitable, anthracnose decreased the strawberry yield by 80%. Transplants are believed to be the main source of primary inoculum, but complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberry in China is unclear.
Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions (Cannon et al.
2012). The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three Colletotrichum species or spe cies complexes have been reported to cause strawberry anthracnose: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al.
2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae both have narrow host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a fewC. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al.
2016). The pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose in Hubei prov ince, China, were divided into two groups: the C. gloeosporioides spe cies complex (Colletotrichum aenigma, Colletotrichum fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and Colletotrichum murrayae) and the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum and Colletotrichum nymphaeae). In Florida,
Ureña-Padilla et al. (2002) suggested that the pathogen-causing an thracnose on the strawberry root crowns and stolons wasC. gloeospor ioides, whereas the pathogens causing anthracnose on the strawberry fruit were members of the C. acutatum complex.
Based on morphological characters and analysis of internal tran scribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA, Xie et al. (2010) showed that strawberry anthracnose infections in Zhejiang and Shanghai were caused by C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae. How ever, because this study only analyzed a single region and did not use multiple genes, the results may not be accurate. Indeed, multigene phylogenetic analyses in conjunction with morphological characters have been used to identify many important pathogens (Cai et al.
2009; Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). The classification and delimitation of Colletotrichum species have been debated (Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum isolates have been successfully identified based on multigene phylogenies and morphological charac ters, indicating that this method is mature and can accurately identify pathogens (Damm et al. 2012). Morphological characters and multi gene phylogenies have not been used to identify the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in China or to deter mine the distributions of these species.

The objectives of this study were (i) to use morphological and mo lecular characters to identify the species causing strawberry anthrac nose in Zhejiang province and (ii) to determine the distributions and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species throughout the region.Materials and Methods
Source and collection of fungal isolates. Zhejiang province (27°02¢ to 31°11¢N, 118°01¢ to 123°10¢ E) is located on the southeast coast of the Yangtze River in southeastern China (He et al. 2013), and it has a humid, subtropical monsoon climate. We collected 234 an thracnose samples from strawberry plants cultivated in Zhejiang prov ince between 2013 and 2017 (Fig. 1). The samples included irregularly shaped lesions from the stem; black, spindle-shaped lesions from the leaves or petioles; reddish brown stolons; or the entire plant if roots were withered (Supplementary Fig. S1). Pathogens were isolated from diseased petiole, leaf, stolon, or root tissues. The diseased plant tissues were first cut into 5 × 5-mm pieces using sterilized scissors. Excised tissue pieces were rinsed in 75% ethanol solution for 30 s, soaked in a 3% sodium hypochlorite solu tion (active chlorine: 6.8%) for 3 min, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, and then, dried on sterile filter paper. After it was dried, each sample was placed on a plate containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium supplemented with a final concentration of 50 mg/ml of kanamycin sulfate and streptomycin sulfate to inhibit bacterial growth. The plate was incubated in an incubator at 25°C in darkness for 3 to 5 days. Hyphal growth was aseptically transferred to a new PDA plate (Cai et al. 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). An thracnose isolates were identified and selected based on the morpho logical characteristics of each species. Isolates were maintained onPDA slants at 4°C.
DNA extraction and PCR. When about 67% of the PDA plate (90 mm) was covered by mycelia, the hyphae were scraped off with sterile slides. DNA was extracted from the hyphae using a fungal ge nomic DNA rapid extraction kit (B518229-0100; Sangon Biotech). DNA extracted from each isolatewas stored at−20°C. The target genes amplified in this study were actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and the ITS. The corresponding primers used for PCR amplification are shown in Table 1.
The PCRswere performed in anAppliedBiosystemsVeriti Thermal
Cycler in a total volume of 50ml. The PCRmixtures contained 31.6ml of UV-sterilized ultrafiltered water, 5 ml of 10× PCR buffer (with 20 mM MgCl2), 5 ml of dNTPs (each 20 mM), 2 ml of each primer (10 mM), 2 ml of abumin from bovine serum (BSA), 2 ml of genomic
DNA, and 0.4 ml (1 U) of Roche FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase. PCRs were performed in a thermal cycler (PTC-100TM Peltier 
Thermal Cycler). The parameter for GAPDH is as follows: denatur ation at 94°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 60°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 0.5 min and a final cycle at 72°C for 10 min.
The parameter for ITS is as follows: 94°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 52°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 40 s and a final step at 72°C for 10 min. The parameter for CAL is as follows: 94°C for 5 min followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 min, 55°C for 45 s, and 72°C for 40s and a final step at 72°C for 10 min. The parameter for the ACT and CHS-1 is as follows: denaturation at 94°C for 4 min fol lowed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 s, 58°C for 30 s, and 72°C for 1 min and a final cycle of 10 min at 72°C (Weir et al. 2012).
PCR products were assessed using electrophoresis: 50 ml of each amplicon was run on a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide in 1% Tris-acetate EDTA buffer for 30 min and then, photographed under UV light (Han et al. 2016). Gels were sent to Kingsley (Nanjing,China) for sequencing.
All sequences were grouped by gene and aligned using DNAMAN v. 7.0. Sequences with single-nucleotide polymorphisms were ampli fied and sequenced three times to ensure that the observed polymor phisms were not because of sequencing errors.
Molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses. Sequences homologous to theACT,CAL,CHS-1,GAPDH, and ITS gene sequences from the isolates were downloaded from GenBank. Colletotrichum boninense (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants [ICMP] 17904) was used as the outgroup (Hyde et al. 2014; Weir et al. 2012). All sequences were aligned using Clustal X 2.0.10 (Larkin et al. 2007). Gene sequences were compared and corrected using the “W” function in MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al. 2011). Gene sequences were concatenated. Modeltest3.7.win, Win-paup4b10-console, and Mrmodeltest2 (Nylander 2004) as implemented in the
MrMTgui were used to estimate the best model of nucleotide sub stitution (Vaidya et al. 2011). Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenies were constructed using Mr. Bayers v. 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 gen erations each, and trees were sampled every 100th generation. The first 2,000 trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used to calculate pos terior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. Phylogenetic trees were drawn using Treeview (Page 1996). The alignments and trees have been deposited in TreeBASE. The fungal isolates used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1. Morphological and cultural characterization. Morphological and cultural characterizations were performed for all of the 91 iso lates according to themethods described by Cai et al. (2009).Mycelia plugs (5.0 mm in diameter) from the edge of an actively growing 5-day-old colony of each tested isolate on PDA were transferred to
PDA plates, and they were incubated at 28°C under a mixture of white and near-UV fluorescent light sources with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block, with three replicates of each isolate. Colony color, conidial di mensions, and morphology were assessed using previous described methods (Cai et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2013;Weir et al. 2012). Conidial suspensions of each species were prepared in lactic acid from conid ial masses grown on PDA. The shape and color of the conidia were observed, and the sizes of 50 conidia from each isolate were mea sured at 400× magnification under a light microscope (Carl Zeiss
Microscopy GmbH). Pathogenicity testing. Ninety-one isolates were cultured on PDA medium for 5 days at 25°C. Samples of these isolates were collected from the colony edge using a 5-mm punch. The mycelial surface of sample was placed in the center of an oat medium plate and cultured at 25°C for 5 days. The hyphae on the surface of the resulting colony were scraped off and grown at 25°C under a mixture of white and

Muñoz 2002). After the production of a large number of conidial heaps, spore suspensions were collected in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes using sterilized toothpicks. Spore suspensions were adjusted to 2.0 × 106 conidia per milliliter using a hemocytometer.
Six-week-old leaves of strawberry healthy plants (variety of 
Zhang Ji) that had not been treated with any chemicals were used for inoculations. Both wounded leaves, which were scratched but not pierced with a sterilized insect needle, and nonwounded leaves were adopted to assess the pathogenicity and evaluate the effect of wounds on the infection. Each leaf was inoculated by drop of 10-ml spore suspensions, and the negative control was inoculated with sterile water. Additionally, nine plants were inoculated for each isolate.
Then, plantswere cultured in a greenhouse at 25 ± 5°C for 7 days under a light/dark cycle. Disease was assessed after 7 days by measuring the diameter of the disease lesion (Han et al. 2016). We calculated the dis ease incidence rate as the number diameter of the disease lesion (Han et al. 2016). Data from the pathogenicity test were subjected to one way analysis of variance using the software IBM SPSS Statistics v22 to determine the significance of differences. Means for different species from the pathogenicity test were separated using the least sig nificance difference test at P = 0.05 level.Results
Isolates of Colletotrichum spp. from strawberries in Zhejiang. 
Between 2013 and 2017, 234 samples with typical anthracnose symptoms (Supplementary Fig. S1) were collected in Hangzhou,
Ningbo, Taizhou, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou of Zhejiang province,
China. From these samples, 91 isolates causing anthracnose were isolated. The distributions of the isolates across the region sampled are shown in Figure 1.
Molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses. The ACT, 
CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS genes from all isolates were success fully amplified and sequenced. All isolates were identified as mem bers of theC. gloeosporioides species complex. BI was performed on the haplotypes belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on the concatenated ACT, CHS-1, CAL, GAPDH, and ITS se quences. The concatenated alignment included 2,486 characters. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: ACT: 1 to 311; CAL: 312 to 1,189; CHS: 1,190 to 1,496; GAPDH: 1,497 to 1,804; and ITS: 1,805 to 2,486.
The tested 91 isolates fell into four clades. BI values indicated that 48 isolates clustered with C. fructicola, 21 isolates clustered with
Colletotrichum siamense, 13 isolates clustered with C. gloeosporioides, and 9 isolates clustered with C. aenigma (Fig. 2). C. fructicola was most frequently isolated, identified in 53% of all samples, and BI val ues of 1.0 between 48 tested isolates. The BI values between tested isolates and C. fructicola ICMP 17921*, ICMP 18646*, and ICMP 18581* were 1.0, 0.92, and 0.92, respectively. C. siamense (23% of all samples) was distributed mainly in the central and eastern re gions of Zhejiang province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Taizhou). Nine isolates had BI values of 0.5 with C. siamense 
ICMP 18642*, whereas the other four and eight isolates both had
BI values of 0.53 with C. siamense ICMP 19118* and C. siamense
ICMP 18578*, respectively. The third species, identified asC. gloeo sporioides, accounted for 14% of all samples with BI values of 1, and it was primarily distributed in the central part of Zhejiang province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, and Ningbo). The fourth species (10%), C. aenigma, which was found in the central part of Zhejiang province as, had BI values of 0.89 with C. aenigma ICMP 18608* (Figs. 1 and 2).
Morphological characters. The morphologies of the colonies of the four species grown on PDA media did not differ substantially. C. fructicola produced white colonies with irregular gray edges, and colonies were black on the back of PDA plates. The orange conidia were cylindrical with blunt or pointed ends, and attached cells were single or scattered. Most conidia were spherical, cylindrical, or spin dle shaped, and very few were irregular. A small number of conidia produced two nearly circular attached cells (Fig. 3). The C. siamense colony was fluffy, with gray-white edges. The colony was neatly arranged, with yellow margins in the middle of the back of PDA plates. Conidia were straight, cylindrical, colorless, and smooth, with blunt ends. Spores attached to cells were brown, oval, or spindle shaped, with complete edges. A few irregularly shaped spores were observed (Fig. 4). The C. gloeosporioides colony was gray in the middle with white edges, and the back of the colony was black to gray with white edges. The conidial heaps were orange, cylindrical, and blunt at both ends or slightly pointed at one end (Fig. 5). Attached cells were single or scattered, and most were spherical or elliptical, with a few irregular cells. The aerial hyphae of C. aenigma were sparse, light gray to white, and flocculent. The colony was light white on the back, with a gray-green center. Conidia heaps were rare. The conidia were stick like, with one end obtusely rounded or with both ends slightly rounded. Most conidia had oil balls. Conidia were singly or loosely distributed, dark brown, and ovate or irregularly shaped.
Some conidia were clover shaped (Fig. 6). Mycelial growth rates, at tached cells, and conidia sizes in details are described in Table 2.
Pathogenicity assays. All isolates of each species showed stron ger pathogenicity on wounded leaves than on nonwounded leaves (Table 2). For example, all isolates of C. fructicola had mean disease incidence (percentage) rates of 79.9 ± 0.7 and 22.2 ± 0.7 and lesion diameters of 20.5 and 17.0 mm onwounded and nonwounded leaves, respectively. Meanwhile, significant difference (P = 0.05) was ob served in lesion diameter but not in disease incidence between four species on wounded leaves. On nonwounded leaves, significant differ ence (P = 0.05) was observed in both lesion diameter and disease in cidence between species, and C. fructicola had higher pathogenicity.
Significant difference existed between and within species (Table 2).
In Supplementary Figure S2, one isolate with the strongest pathogenic ability within each species was presented: C. fructicola (HJD-49),
C. siamense (HJD4-7), C. gloeosporioides (GT-10), and C. aenigma (nbg-18). HJD-49 (C. fructicola) had strong pathogenicity both on wounded leaves and on nonwounded leaves. Among C. siamense, the first reported species on strawberry in Zhejiang, only a small por tion of isolates, such as HJD4-7, caused similar disease on both

Plant Disease /May 2020 1353 wounded leaves and nonwounded leaves, whereas most isolates, such as ZJE-3, had strong pathogenicity on wounded leaves but weak path ogenicity on nonwounded leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). Discussion
This study performed a phylogenetic analysis using a combination of five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) (Damm et al.
2012; Weir et al. 2012) and used this phylogeny as well as morpho logical characters to identify 91 different isolates from samples of strawberry anthracnose collected in six cities in Zhejiang province,
China. The species causing strawberry anthracnose were identified as C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense.
All four of these species belong to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The C. gloeosporioides complex, C. fragariae, and the
C. acutatum complex have been previously reported to infect straw berries and cause strawberry anthracnose (Denoyes-Rothan et al.
2003). TheC. gloeosporioides complex includes >30 species, includ ing C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al. 2008; Weir et al. 2012).
This is the first report of C. siamense infecting strawberry plants and causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang. We found that C. siamense was the second most common species causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province. C. siamense is a synonym of Col letotrichum jasmini-sambac (Wikee et al. 2011) and Colletotrichum hymenocallidis (Yan et al. 2011). Although this species was origi nally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, it has a wide geographical distribution and host range (Prihastuti et al. 2009).
Based on the variability in C. siamense morphological characters, it has been suggested that environment conditions might affect my celial growth (Li 2012). Different types of C. siamense colonies were observed in this study. The hyphal growth rate was relatively slow under the culture conditions used here. The colonies were gen erally grayish white, and a conidia pile was easily produced on PDA media. In the inoculation study, pathogenicity differed even within species. The isolates of C. siamense have rarely been studied, but our results indicate that future studies of the pathogenesis of these isolates are needed.

C. fructicola was originally reported in Thailand as a pathogen of coffee berries. This isolate grows quickly in hot, humid conditions, and it has a strong sporulation ability (Prihastuti et al. 2009). The spe ciesC. fructicola,C. gloeosporioides, andC. aenigma can cause straw berry anthracnose (Han et al. 2016). Here, C. fructicola accounted for 52.7%of all samples andwas observed in all regions sampled, suggest ing that this is the dominant species causing strawberry anthracnose in
Zhejiang province. It is believed that C. fructicola is more pathogenic than C. gloeosporioides or C. aenigma (Han et al. 2016). Consistent with this, our pathogenicity experiments showed that C. fructicola was more pathogenic than C. gloeosporioides and C. aenigma. A pre vious study reported that C. murrayaewas the dominant species caus ing strawberry anthracnose in Hubei, China, but no isolates of this species were found in this study (Han et al. 2016).
C. gloeosporioideswas previously thought to infect many types of fruit, particularly in the tropics (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003; Freeman et al. 1998; Sangeetha and Rawal 2007). However, studies have shown that this species is uncommon in the tropics and rarely causes anthrac nose in tropical fruits (Phoulivong et al. 2010; Prihastuti et al. 2009;
Rojas et al. 2010; Udayanga et al. 2013). In addition, not all isolates of C. gloeosporioides were pathogenic to strawberries in greenhouse tests (Mertely and Legard 2004). Here,C. gloeosporioideswas present in 14.3% of all samples, and it was the third most dominant group.
However, we found that the disease index of this species was low, con sistent with previous studies (Hu et al. 2014).
C. aenigmawas first described byWeir et al. (2012) based on phy logenetic analysis and morphological descriptions. This species pri marily infects Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and Persea americana in
Israel (Weir et al. 2012), but it has been reported on grapes and a wide range of hosts (Yan et al. 2011). It is less virulent to strawberries, and it does not resist high temperatures (Han et al. 2016). The distribution of C. aenigma on strawberries in Zhejiang province is relatively sparse (Yan et al. 2011). The description of Colletotrichum annigma might be useful for the classification of the C. gloeosporioides com plex, and the characteristics of this species require further study.
Strawberry anthracnose was previously thought to be caused by a complex of C. gloeosporioides species, C. acutatum species, and C. fragariae (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). It is thought that the incidence of this disease relates to the host plant (Weir et al. 2012).
Ureña-Padilla et al. (2002) suggested that the C. gloeosporioides complex caused anthracnose in the root crown, that C. acutatum caused anthracnose in the fruit, and that the C. gloeosporioides com plex caused the infection in the canopy. The C. gloeosporioides spe cies complex most commonly causes strawberry anthracnose in
China, whereas theC. acutatum species complex occasionally causes anthracnose (Xie et al. 2010). Three C. acutatum isolates were
