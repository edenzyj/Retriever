HORTSCIENCE 28(10): 1055–1056. 1993. US 70 was produced alongside the standard cultivar 'Tangi' in 1990 and 1991, as well as ‘Chandler’ in 1990, and performed better than ‘Chandler’ during the abbreviated 1991 season. US 70 fruit were later in ripening and similar in size to 'Tangi' fruit in 1990, but they ripened earlier and were larger than 'Tangi' in 1991. In comparison, US 70 fruit ripened at the same time but were smaller than 'Chandler' fruit in 1990, yet they ripened at the same time and were larger than 'Chandler' in 1991.
The outstanding features of US 70 include high resistance levels to leaf spot (Mycosphaerella fragariae), leaf scorch (Diplocarpon earliana), powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca macularis f. sp. fragariae), anthracnose crown rot, and two-spotted mites (Tetranychus urticae); good fruit quality; bright red color; large size; and an extended harvest season.
The clones described in this germplasm release were developed through a cooperative effort by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and state agricultural experiment station personnel to combat the limitations posed by anthracnose crown rot disease on strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa) production in the southeastern United States. Data for plants grown in Poplarville were gathered and analyzed by B.J. Smith. Morphological plant and fruit characterization efforts began in Beltsville, Maryland, in 1975 and continued through 1991.
US 70 plants are medium-sized and compact, featuring medium-green leaves with three leaflets of equal size. The central leaflets curve downward at the tips, while the side leaflets curve upward at the margins. Leaf serrations are rounded but pointed at the tips. The undersides of the leaves display prominent veins, and the leaf petioles are light green and pubescent. The fruit of US 70 has a shouldered wedge shape with a blunt tip, narrow pointed fruit cap sepals that are partially reflexed at maturity, and slightly raised yellow achenes. US 70 fruit are firm-fleshed, light pink internally, and juicy, with a pleasant flavor that is sweet and acidic.
US 70 has transmitted anthracnose resistance, contributing to the development of regionally resistant strawberry materials.
US 70 is now retired, having been in use since 1977, and is considered a suitable disease-resistant parent for breeding programs. Under the direction of G.J.G., disease epidemiology information and isolate FL 73-780, along with Louisiana selection 2556, have been developed. Starting in 1975, both winter or early spring hill culture production and mid- to late spring matted row culture and inoculation techniques were established in Poplarville, Mississippi, under the supervision of B.J.S. (Smith and Black, 1987, 1990; Smith and Spiers, 1982; Smith et al., 1990).
US 159, tested as MSUS 159, was the result of a 1982 cross in Beltsville of C. acutatum Simmonds with US 78-1760 AN (Florida Belle × LA 2556). In Mississippi hill culture trials, US 159 has shown severe fruit rot incited by C. acutatum (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1987). Additionally, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. may also cause strawberry anthracnose crown and fruit rot (Smith and Black, 1990). While all three fungal species can lead to strawberry plant death, C. fragariae is typically the primary cause in the U.S. Gulf Coast states, whereas C. acutatum is the main incitant of anthracnose fruit rot in this area (Howard et al., 1992).
The inheritance models for anthracnose crown rot resistance were established by Gupton and Smith (1991). US 159 demonstrated a high ability to generate runners and generally exhibited good plant health. In 1983, it was screened in Poplarville against crown rot, two-spotted mites, leaf spot, and a mixture of C. fragariae isolates, including CF-1, CF-4, FL-2, LA-1, CF-75, and CF-CARD.
During the more typical 1990 season in Mississippi, US 292 yielded similarly to ‘Chandler’ but less than ‘Tangi’ (noted in a detailed comparison in Table 1). Its fruit ripened later, and the plants showed greater vigor than either standard cultivar. US 292's fruit size exceeded that of ‘Tangi’ and matched ‘Chandler’ in 1990, while it was larger than both standards in 1991. In Maryland, US 292 emerged as a promising late-maturing clone in matted row production.

US 438 was selected in 1988 in Poplarville, Mississippi. Recent tests conducted by Southern Florida cooperators indicate that US 438, similar to US 292, yielded lower than the 'Chandler' cultivar but shows resistance to runner infection caused by Colletotrichum fragariae. US 292 exhibited high resistance to anthracnose (Colletotrichum acutatum). In Mississippi, US 438 yielded comparably to 'Tangi' and better than 'Chandler'. It ripens earlier than both standard cultivars and produced both smaller and larger fruit than the standards over two seasons. In matted row production in Maryland, US 438 performed averagely, ripening early and displaying generally good characteristics for plant bed and fruit. While fruit symmetry and skin toughness were below expectations, plant stand, vigor, and fruit firmness were superior.
US 438 plants are large, dense, vigorous, and free of disease. The leaves are large and rugose, with leaflets curling down at the tip as they mature. They are medium to light green with lighter green undersides, featuring prominent main and branch veins. The leaves have sharply pointed serrations and pubescent petioles, with hairs positioned at a 90° angle to the stem axis. The flower petals are rounded and overlapping, with small anthers that produce abundant pollen; the stamens are erect and the sepals narrow.
The fruit of US 438 is dark scarlet, firm, and has a dry consistency with a pleasant, acidic flavor. The shape is a long wedge, with achenes flush or slightly raised. The cap is large, showy, and partially reflexed. Following inoculation of plants at flowering with C. acutatum conidia, US 438 fruit exhibited no anthracnose fruit rot at Castle Hayne, North Carolina, early in the ripening season (April 21, 1992), while 70% of 'Chandler' fruit was infected (James Ballington, North Carolina State University, personal communication).
Interested parties may request in vitro starter stocks (up to five per clone) of any or all of these selections from B.J. Smith, USDA Agricultural Research Service, Small Fruit Research Station, P.O. Box 287, Poplarville, MS 39470 (phone: 601/795-8751, fax: 601/795-4965). The in vitro stocks were produced from apical meristem explants and are considered free of fungal and bacterial contaminants, and presumably free of viruses.
