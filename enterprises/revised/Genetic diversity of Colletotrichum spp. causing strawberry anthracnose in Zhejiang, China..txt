Anthracnose is a serious fungal disease that primarily infects strawberry roots and stolons during their development. In this study, 91 isolates from different areas of Zhejiang Province, China, were collected. Morphological characteristics were analyzed, and a phylogenetic analysis based on multiple genes (actin, internal transcribed spacer, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) was performed.
All identified Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose belonged to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. Among these, we identified 48 isolates of C. fructicola, 21 isolates of C. siamense, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides, and 9 isolates of C. aenigma. Notably, C. siamense was distributed in the central and eastern regions of Zhejiang Province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Taizhou). This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang Province. C. fructicola was identified as the most dominant species responsible for strawberry anthracnose in the region.
Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa), native to South America, are widely cultivated in China, with cultivation areas increasing from 90,100 ha in 1985 to 330,000 ha in 2012. China produces 35.7% of all strawberries globally, making it the largest producer (Peng and Peng 2011). Zhejiang Province ranks among the top eight strawberry-producing regions in China (Shen 2014).
Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions (Cannon et al. 2012). The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight major plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three species or species complexes of Colletotrichum have been reported to cause anthracnose in strawberries: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae have narrower host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a few C. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al. 2016).
In Hubei province, China, the pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose were divided into two groups: the C. gloeosporioides species complex (including Colletotrichum aenigma, Colletotrichum fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and Colletotrichum murrayae) and the C. acutatum complex (comprising C. acutatum and Colletotrichum nymphaeae). In Florida, Ureña-Padilla et al. (2002) suggested that the pathogen causing anthracnose on strawberry root crowns and stolons was C. gloeosporioides, while the pathogens causing anthracnose on strawberry fruit were members of the C. acutatum complex.
Based on morphological characteristics and analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA, Xie et al. (2010) showed that strawberry anthracnose infections in Zhejiang and Shanghai were caused by C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae. However, since this study only analyzed a single region and did not use multiple genes, the results may not be entirely accurate. Indeed, multigene phylogenetic analyses, combined with morphological characteristics, have been used to identify many important pathogens (Cai et al. 2009; Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). The classification and delimitation of Colletotrichum species have been debated (Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum isolates have been successfully identified based on multigene phylogenies and morphological characteristics, indicating that this method is mature and can accurately identify pathogens (Damm et al. 2012). However, morphological characteristics and multigene phylogenies have not yet been used to identify the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in China or to determine the distributions of these species.
The objectives of this study were (i) to use morphological and molecular characters to identify the species causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province, and (ii) to determine the distributions and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species throughout the region.
PCR was performed using an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler with a total volume of 50 ml. The PCR mixtures contained 31.6 ml of UV-sterilized ultrafiltered water, 5 ml of 10X PCR buffer (with 20 mM MgCl2), 5 ml of dNTPs (each at 20 mM), 2 ml of each primer (DN10A, mMan), and 4.4 ml of genomic DNA template.
Pathogens were isolated from diseased petiole, leaf, stolon, or root tissues. The diseased plant tissues were first cut into 5 × 5 mm pieces using sterilized scissors. Excised tissue pieces were rinsed in a 75% ethanol solution for 30 seconds, soaked in a 3% sodium hypochlorite solution (active chlorine: 6.8%) for 3 minutes, rinsed three times with sterile distilled water, and then dried on sterile filter paper. After drying, each sample was placed on a plate containing potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium supplemented with a final concentration of 50 mg/ml of kanamycin sulfate and streptomycin sulfate to inhibit bacterial growth. The plate was incubated in darkness at 25 °C for 3 to 5 days. Hyphal growth was aseptically transferred to a new PDA plate (Cai et al. 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Anthracnose isolates were identified and selected based on the morphological characteristics of each species. Isolates were maintained on PDA slants at 4 °C.
For molecular identification and phylogenetic analyses, sequences homologous to the ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS gene sequences from the isolates were downloaded from GenBank. Colletotrichum boninense (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants [ICMP] 17904) was used as the outgroup (Hyde et al. 2014; Weir et al. 2012). All sequences were aligned using ClustalX 2.0.10 (Larkin et al. 2007). Gene sequences were compared and corrected using the DNA function in MEGA 5.0 (Tamura et al. 2011). The gene sequences amplified in this study included actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and ITS. The corresponding primers used for PCR amplification are detailed in Table 1.
For DNA extraction and PCR, when approximately 67% of the PDA plate (90 mm) was covered by mycelia, the hyphae were scraped off with sterile slides. DNA was extracted from the hyphae using a fungal genomic DNA rapid extraction kit (B518229-0100; Sangon Biotech). DNA extracted from each isolate was stored at -20 °C. The model test tools (Modeltest 3.7.win, WinPAUP 4b10-console, and MrModeltest 2 [Nylander 2004]) were used to estimate the best model of nucleotide substitution (Vaidya et al. 2011). Bayesian inference (BI) phylogenies were constructed using MrBayes v. 3.1.2 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck 2003). Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations each, with trees sampled every 100th generation. The first 2,000 trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. Phylogenetic trees were drawn using TreeView (Page 1996). The alignments and trees have been deposited in TreeBASE. The fungal isolates used in this study are listed in Supplementary Table S1.
Ninety-one isolates were cultured on PDA. Figure 1 shows the distribution of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang province, China. For each region, the percentage occurrences of the four media used for colony growth over 5 days at 25 °C were recorded. The mycelial samples of Colletotrichum species were collected from the surfaces of the isolates, including Hangzhou (n = 43), Shaoxing (n = 18), Ningbo (n = 10), Taizhou (n = 6), Jinhua (n = 4), and Wenzhou (n = 10). A sample of Colletotrichum aenigma was placed in the center of an oat medium plate and cultured at 25 °C for 5 days. The hyphae on the surface of the resulting colony were scraped off and grown at 25 °C under a mixture of white and near-UV fluorescent light sources with a 12-h light/12-h dark cycle for 10 to 15 days (de los Santos García de Paredes and Romero Muñoz 2002). After the production of a large number of conidial heaps, spore suspensions were collected in 1.5-ml centrifuge tubes using sterilized toothpicks. The spore suspensions were adjusted to 2.0 × 10^6 conidia per milliliter using a hemocytometer.
Six-week-old healthy strawberry leaves (variety Zhang Ji) that had not been treated with any chemicals were used for inoculations. Both wounded leaves, which were scratched but not pierced with a sterilized insect needle, and non-wounded leaves were tested to assess pathogenicity and evaluate the effect of wounds on infection. Each leaf was inoculated with a drop of 10 μl spore suspensions, and the negative control was inoculated with sterile water. Additionally, nine plants were inoculated for each isolate. The plants were then cultured in a greenhouse at 25–30 °C for 7 days under a light/dark cycle. Disease was assessed after 7 days by measuring the diameter of the disease lesions (Han et al. 2016). We calculated the disease incidence rate as the number of lesions divided by the total number of inoculated leaves (Han et al. 2016). Data from the pathogenicity tests were subjected to one-way analysis of variance using IBM SPSS Statistics v22 to determine the significance of differences. Means for different species from the pathogenicity tests were separated using the least significant difference test at P = 0.05 level.
Between 2013 and 2017, 234 samples with typical anthracnose symptoms (Supplementary Fig. S1) were collected in Hangzhou, Ningbo, Taizhou, Shaoxing, and Wenzhou in Zhejiang province, China. From these samples, 91 isolates causing anthracnose were isolated. The distributions of the isolates across the sampled regions are shown in Figure 1.
The ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS genes from all isolates were successfully amplified and sequenced. All isolates were identified as members of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. A Bayesian inference (BI) analysis was performed on the haplotypes belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on the concatenated ACT, CHS-1, CAL, GAPDH, and ITS sequences. The concatenated alignment included 2,486 characters. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: ACT: 1 to 311; CAL: 312 to 1,189; CHS: 1,190 to 1,496; GAPDH: 1,497 to 1,804; and ITS: 1,805 to 2,486.
ICMP 18642* exhibited the highest BI value of 1, while the other four and eight isolates had BI values of 0.53 with C. siamense ICMP 19118* and C. siamense ICMP 18578*, respectively. The third species, identified as C. gloeosporioides, accounted for 14% of all samples with a BI value of 1 and was primarily distributed in the central part of Zhejiang province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, and Ningbo). The fourth species, C. aenigma, which comprised 10% of the samples, was also found in the central part of Zhejiang province and had a BI value of 0.89 with C. aenigma ICMP 18608* (Figs. 1 and 2).
Morphological Characters: The morphologies of the colonies of the four species grown on PDA media did not differ substantially. C. fructicola produced white colonies with irregular gray edges, with black on the underside of PDA plates. The orange conidia were cylindrical with either blunt or pointed ends, and the attached cells were either single or scattered. Most conidia were spherical, cylindrical, or spindle-shaped, with very few being irregular. A small number of conidia produced two nearly circular attached cells (Fig. 3).
The C. siamense colony was fluffy, with gray-white edges and neatly arranged colonies featuring yellow margins on the underside of the PDA plates. Conidia were straight, cylindrical, colorless, and smooth with blunt ends. Attached cells were brown, oval, or spindle-shaped, exhibiting complete edges, though a few irregularly shaped spores were also observed (Fig. 4).
The C. gloeosporioides colony was gray in the center with white edges, and the underside was black to gray, also with white edges. The conidial heaps were orange, cylindrical, and blunt at both ends or slightly pointed at one end (Fig. 5). Attached cells were single or scattered, with most being spherical or elliptical, and a few irregular cells present.
The aerial hyphae of C. aenigma were sparse, appearing light gray to white and flocculent. The colony was light white on the underside, featuring a gray-green center. Conidia heaps were rare; the conidia were stick-like, with one end obtusely rounded or both ends slightly rounded. Most conidia had oil balls, and they were distributed either singly or loosely, dark brown in color, and ovate or irregularly shaped. Some conidia had a clover shape (Fig. 6). Mycelial growth rates, attached cells, and conidia sizes are detailed in Table 2.
Pathogenicity Assays: All isolates of each species exhibited stronger pathogenicity on wounded leaves than on non-wounded leaves (Table 2). For instance, all isolates of C. fructicola had mean disease incidence rates of 79.9 ± 0.7% on wounded leaves and 22.2 ± 0.7% on non-wounded leaves, with lesion diameters of 20.5 mm and 17.0 mm, respectively. A significant difference (P = 0.05) was observed in lesion diameter but not in disease incidence between the four species on wounded leaves. On non-wounded leaves, significant differences (P = 0.05) were found in both lesion diameter and disease incidence between species, with C. fructicola demonstrating higher pathogenicity. Significant differences existed both between and within species (Table 2).
In Supplementary Figure S2, one isolate with the strongest pathogenic ability from each species was presented: C. fructicola (HJD-49), C. siamense (HJD4-7), C. gloeosporioides (GT-10), and C. aenigma (nbg-18). HJD-49 (C. fructicola) exhibited strong pathogenicity on both wounded and non-wounded leaves. Among C. siamense, which was the first species reported on strawberry in Zhejiang, only a small portion of isolates, such as HJD4-7, caused similar disease on both types of leaves.
Table 1 details the primers used in this study, including their sequences and sources. For example, the primer with the sequence ATGTGCAAGGCCGGTTTCGC was sourced from Carbone and Kohn (1999), while the primer with the sequence TGGGGCAAGGATGCTTGGAAGAAG was also from the same source. Other primers, like those from Templeton et al. (1992) and Gardes and Bruns (1993), are listed with their respective sequences.
In a study conducted in Zhejiang province, China, the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates was assessed on wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves. Most isolates, such as ZJE-3, exhibited strong pathogenicity on wounded leaves but weak pathogenicity on non-wounded leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) to identify 91 different isolates from strawberry anthracnose samples. The species identified were C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, all belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, where it was found to be the second most common species. Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth. Different colony types were observed, with a generally grayish-white appearance and slow hyphal growth under the tested culture conditions. The pathogenicity varied among C. siamense isolates, indicating a need for further research on their pathogenesis.
A phylogenetic tree constructed from 91 isolates in the C. gloeosporioides species complex revealed evolutionary relationships based on concatenated gene sequences, with Bayesian posterior probabilities calculated from 6,000,000 generations. The outgroup used was C. hippeastri, with ex-type cultures highlighted in bold. The scale bar represents expected changes per site.
Colletotrichum fructicola, initially reported as a pathogen of coffee berries in Thailand, showed rapid growth and strong sporulation in hot, humid conditions. This species accounted for 52.7% of all samples in the study and was dominant in all regions sampled, suggesting it is the primary cause of strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang. Pathogenicity experiments indicated that C. fructicola was more pathogenic than C. gloeosporioides or C. aenigma, in line with previous findings that noted C. murrayae as the dominant species in Hubei, China, although none were found in this study.
However, we found that the disease index of this species was low, consistent with previous studies (Hu et al. 2014). C. aenigma was first described by Weir et al. (2012) based on phylogenetic analysis and morphological descriptions. This species primarily infects Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and Persea americana in Israel (Weir et al. 2012), but it has been reported on grapes and a wide range of hosts (Yan et al. 2011). It is less virulent to strawberries and does not resist high temperatures (Han et al. 2016). The distribution of C. aenigma on strawberries in Zhejiang province is relatively sparse (Yan et al. 2011). The description of Colletotrichum aenigma might be useful for the classification of the C. gloeosporioides complex, and the characteristics of this species require further study. Strawberry anthracnose was previously thought to be caused by a complex of C. gloeosporioides species, C. acutatum species, and C. fragariae (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). It is believed that the incidence of this disease relates to the host plant (Weir et al. 2012). Ureña-Padilla et al. (2002) suggested that the C. gloeosporioides complex caused anthracnose in the root crown, that C. acutatum caused anthracnose in the fruit, and that the C. gloeosporioides complex caused the infection in the canopy. The C. gloeosporioides species complex most commonly causes strawberry anthracnose in China, whereas the C. acutatum species complex occasionally causes anthracnose (Xie et al. 2010).
The text includes a table summarizing the morphological data of Colletotrichum isolates and the pathogenicity of four group strains on both wounded and nonwounded strawberry leaves. The table details conidia and appressoria measurements, including their lengths and widths, alongside colony characteristics, growth rates, and disease incidence percentages. Each strain's ability to cause disease is assessed seven days after inoculation, providing insights into their virulence based on lesion diameters and incidence rates.
Identified in Hubei, China, by Han et al. (2016), this study did not find any C. acutatum species that have previously been reported to cause infections in strawberry plants (MacKenzie et al. 2008).
