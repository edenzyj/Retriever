Plant pathogens have evolved various dispersal mechanisms, utilizing biotic or abiotic vectors, or a combination of both. Rain splash dispersal is well-documented in numerous fungi and can be an efficient driver of crop epidemics, allowing infectious strains to propagate rapidly among genetically homogenous neighboring plants. However, splashing is primarily a local dispersal process, and spores carried by raindrops rarely travel farther than a few decimeters.
In this study, we assessed the rain splash dispersal of conidia from the yam anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, in an experimental setting using a rain simulator, focusing on the impact of soil contamination (i.e., the effect of re-splashing events). Spores were dispersed up to 50 cm from the yam leaf inoculum sources, though with an exponential decrease in dispersal with increasing distance. While few spores were dispersed via re-splashing from contaminated soil, the proportion deposited by this mechanism increased with distance from the initial source. We found no carryover of soil contamination from previous rains, suggesting that contamination via re-splashing from contaminated soils primarily occurred within single rain events. We conclude that most dispersal occurs from direct splashing, with a lesser contribution from indirect dispersal via re-splashing.

Since dispersal is a key process in pathogen life cycles, the distance traveled from the source is one of the main objectives of epidemiological studies (e.g., [14]). Although rain-splash dispersal is generally a local process, it is important to understand how rain characteristics influence the distance spores travel via splashing. Splash dispersal may vary with rain intensity, duration, frequency, size, and velocity of falling drops, as well as the wash-off of spores that have just been dispersed. Typically, rain intensity does not increase the dispersal rate directly ([9], [15]), but it may enhance spore release, thereby increasing the total number of spores dispersed and the probability of long-distance dispersal events [7]. Conversely, more intense rain may decrease effective dispersal by washing away spores that have just been dispersed [15], meaning that heavy rainfall does not always correlate with increased rates of pathogen dispersal. In contrast, drop size may be more crucial than rain intensity, as larger drops are more effective at displacing spores through splash [1]. In still air, splashes can disperse spores up to approximately 70 cm [1]. Models indicate that the mechanism of water splashing is best described as a function of inertia between impacting drops and surface tension at the point of impact [16]. Additionally, interactions between the chemical and physical properties of spores and water are likely to influence dispersal rates [16], although little is known about this at a biological level.
Environmental factors beyond rain, splash, and spore characteristics also affect dispersal locally. For instance, soil type, ground cover, plant canopy, and host density all significantly impact spore dispersal through splashing. Vegetation may act as a barrier, limiting the reach to neighboring hosts. Ground cover has been shown to effectively limit splash dispersal, with neighboring canopy leaves reducing dispersal by 90% compared to bare ground [12]. The presence of weeds is estimated to decrease overall dispersal distance by half [17]. Additionally, splash dispersal varies across canopy stages, with splashes from the upper sides of leaves causing infections at the tips, while splashes from the lower sides infect the base of leaves [18]. Moreover, the effects of splashing can vary between and within species ([19], [20]).
Soil topography and composition also greatly affect splash dispersal. For example, mulch or straw cover reduces dispersal more than plastic sheet cover does ([12], [21]), even on sloped ground, although recurrent lateral and backward splashes can still move spores uphill (e.g., [22]). Dispersal may further vary with soil moisture, as spores dispersed from focal sources are more numerous in inundated soils compared to bare soils [17]. Surprisingly, few studies have investigated the potential effects of prior rains and soil contamination on splash dispersal. It is known that spores present in muddy soils can be splashed further during subsequent rains, as documented in natural settings [23]. However, little is known about how prior soil contamination impacts splash dispersal.
In this study, we assessed rain splash dispersal of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. and Sacc conidia in an experimental setting using a rain simulator (as suggested by Reynolds [24]), focusing on the re-splash of spores from previously contaminated soil. We aimed to answer the following questions: What is the relative importance of initial direct splashing versus re-splashing in local pathogen dispersal? Can spores from prior ground contamination be dispersed by subsequent rain?
We investigated rainsplash efficiency through experimental rains following Reynolds et al. [24]. Artificial simulated rain was produced for two minutes for each assay (run) using a Deltalab Microprocessor Controlled Spray System, EID 330, developed by IRD (Asseline & Valentin, 1978), to simulate rain in still air. Rainfall was created by a constant speed oscillating nozzle (Deltalab, Tec Jet SS 6560) with a sweep angle of 120° positioned at a height of 2.50 m. The water pressure at the nozzle orifice was set at 62 kPa.
For the inoculum sources, we used infected yam leaf fragments with sporulating necroses placed in Petri dishes containing 10 mL of distilled water and Cotton Blue, which was applied five minutes prior to the runs to stain the spores. These Petri dishes were situated at the center of the rain assay within a conic tent featuring a 30 cm diameter opening at the top. The ground surface inside the tent was covered with rough paper sheets (plain Joseph paper grade 551, purchased from VWR, reference 111-500x), which were changed every two runs to ensure non-contaminated soil treatment (for odd-numbered runs) and soils with initial rain contamination (for even-numbered runs).
For each run, 60 plain microscope slides (W6D6H: 7662661 mm, purchased from VWR, reference 631 1552) were arranged in concentric circles around the spore source at specific distances of 24, 31, 38, and 45 cm from the source. The experimental rain caused dilution of the inoculum sources, with approximately 8 mL of rainwater on average falling into the Petri dishes. Despite this dilution, the spores remained heavily stained, allowing us to differentiate between directly dispersed spores (blue-stained) and spores dispersed indirectly via re-splash (rinsed, colorless spores) during counting.
We estimated spore concentrations in the inoculum source before (initial spore solution) and after rain treatment (residual spore solution, accounting for dilution) by sampling and counting spores on a hemacytometer under a light microscope. The initial spore solution was not controlled for variation in spore concentration, but we used concentration as a covariate in our analyses (initial spore concentration). The concentration range for the twelve runs was 2.68 to 5.92 × 10^5 spores/mL (mean concentration: 4.06 × 10^5 spores/mL).
The total number of exported spores was estimated for each rain (hereafter referred to as "run"), and ground contamination was determined as the number of exported spores remaining between runs. We estimated ground contamination as the number of spores left on the ground after rain, which was calculated as the difference between initial and residual spore estimates from the inoculum source, corrected for dilution due to rain. The difference in spore numbers before and after rain indicates the number of spores dispersed during the run and serves as a proxy for the contaminating spores left on the ground after the rain.
The estimated range of exported spores (and soil contamination) was between 1.62 to 4.95 × 10^5 spores/mL. Slides were randomly selected for each run and stratified according to the sampled distance. Notably, only two slides at the 24 cm distance were counted due to heavy contamination loads, while four slides were counted for all other distances.
Spores were counted under light transmission microscopy, using whole slide counts. It was easy to distinguish individual drops on the slides from all dispersal distances, so we counted both drops and spores per drop. We distinguished between blue drops containing blue-stained spores (directly dispersed from the Cotton Blue-stained petri dish) and pale or colorless spores from rinsed drops (dispersal via re-splashing from the ground). In total, we counted 174 slides from 12 runs, with 6 runs involving uncontaminated soil and 6 runs with contaminated soil.
To avoid the issue of pseudo-replication for slides within runs, we analyzed means at the run level. We first conducted a two-way full factorial ANOVA in R to test whether the number of drops dispersed to slides varied with distance from the petri dish spore source and whether this variation differed between directly dispersed blue drops and rinsed, secondarily dispersed colorless drops. Next, we performed an ANCOVA to examine the effect of distance and type of dispersal (primary or secondary, assessed by drop color) on the mean spore number per drop, using initial spore concentration and previous soil contamination as covariates. We included interaction terms between drop color and distance to account for the potential impact of inoculum source on direct dispersal (blue drops) and the influence of prior soil contamination on indirect dispersal (washed drops).
Lastly, we conducted an analysis of covariance to evaluate the impact of distance and source of dispersal (color of drops) on the total number of spores dispersed, again including initial spore concentration and previous soil contamination as covariates. Interaction terms were added to assess the potential effects of inoculum source and prior soil contamination on different dispersal types. The assumptions of homoscedasticity and normality of residuals were met for all analyses.
Several fit indices were assessed once the best model was identified. Given the moderate sample size (N = 166), we followed Hu and Bentler's suggestion to favor SMRSR over RMSEA among indices of model fit, as RMSEA tends to make many type-one errors, rejecting true population models. We reported diverse fit indices following Hooper's recommendations for path reports. The retained model had a Chi-squared value of 3.35 (2 df, P = 0.187), indicating that the model covariance matrix did not significantly differ from the data covariance matrix, even though the distance factor deviated from a normal distribution. As noted in the SEM and path literature, Chi-squared may suffer from a lack of power and may be inadequate due to our moderate sample size. Following Hooper's suggested fit index report, the RMSEA estimate is 0.064 (95% CI = 0.00–0.18), which is slightly above the recommended conservative rejection threshold for fair fit. Given the maximum likelihood (ML) method used here and the moderate sample size, we opted to use SMRSR instead. The SMRSR for the retained model is good (0.025), and the Bentler Comparative Fit Index is very good (0.995).
We found that direct dispersal from the source predominates, with re-splashing contributing only weakly to local dispersal, though its contribution increases with greater distances, thereby enhancing the probability of infection among neighboring plants in fields. Prior ground contamination had no significant impact on further dispersal by rain, suggesting no carryover of spores between rainfalls.
The number of drops decreased with distance from the source (Table 1A; Fig. 2A), and this effect was more pronounced for direct splashes from the inoculum source (blue drops) compared to re-splashes (rinsed drops). There was a significant interaction between distance and drop color. Re-splash drops are sequentially pushed forward during rainfall. Drop distribution differed between short distances (24 and 31 cm), where higher numbers of drops were observed due to the filtering zone receiving drops from both rain and re-splashes, and greater distances (38 and 45 cm), where drop numbers were lower. Consequently, while direct splashes from the inoculum source contributed significantly to the total number of drops at short distances, re-splash drop numbers contributed more at a distance of 45 cm. Despite this greater contribution of re-splash at long distances, the average spore numbers per drop were always higher in blue drops, and the number of spores dispersed indirectly via rinsed drops declined with distance, remaining relatively constant in blue drops. Overall, most spore deposition occurred through direct splashes (blue drops), although the difference between direct and indirect dispersal decreased with distance.
Both direct splashing and indirect re-splashing contributed to dispersal, but a significant interaction was observed between distance and drop color: blue drops consistently decreased with distance while washed drops plateaued. The interaction between distance and drop color was highly significant, with mean spore numbers per rinsed drops consistently lower.
Table 1 presents the effects of distance, source of dispersal (indicated by the color of drops: blue for direct dispersal and rinsed for indirect dispersal), and their interaction on dispersal parameters. It includes three subcategories: A) Number of Drops, B) Mean Spore Number per Drop, and C) Total Spores Dispersed. The table emphasizes significance with bold P-values, highlighting the statistical relationships among the variables.
The study examines the relationship between prior soil contamination and spore dispersal efficiency. A key figure in the study (Fig. 2) compares direct and indirect splashing efficiency as a function of distance, illustrating three key metrics: A. Total number of drops, B. Mean spore number per drop, and C. Total number of spores dispersed. The scales on the Y-axes are logarithmic for each plot. Grey boxes represent direct splashing from the source (indicated by blue drops), while white boxes indicate indirect re-splashing events (depicted as clear drops). Data points that fall outside the 95% confidence interval are marked with circles.
The findings reveal that mean spore number per drop and total spores dispersed are significantly affected by distance (with dispersal decreasing over distance, as shown in Fig. 2B and 2C) and by the source of dispersal (indicated by drop color). However, these metrics were not influenced by the initial spore solution concentration or levels of prior soil contamination (refer to Table 1B and 1C). This indicates that re-splashes are likely less sensitive to the number of spores available for dispersal in either leaf inoculum or contaminated ground, and are potentially more influenced by the physical properties of rain and drops, which were not evaluated in this study. Consequently, previously dispersed spores do not significantly contribute to dispersal during subsequent rain events. Most contamination occurs through direct splashing or re-splashing within individual rain events.
Distance, the number of blue drops, and mean spore number per blue drop significantly impacted dispersal (illustrated in Fig. 3). However, mean spores per rinsed drop had a weaker and insignificant impact in our path model, possibly due to its interaction with distance. All aspects of spore dispersal, particularly direct dispersal (measured by the number of blue drops), decreased with increasing distance from the spore source. The mean spore number per blue drop had the strongest effect on dispersal and was more influential than the number of blue drops (with path gradients of 0.48 vs. 0.19, respectively), making it the primary driver of spore dispersal. Interestingly, the number of blue drops was negatively correlated with the mean spore number per blue drop (-0.36), suggesting that greater opportunities for direct dispersal did not necessarily result in an overall increase in spores dispersed. This indicates that incident drops may have broken into several smaller droplets, each containing fewer spores, though this was not investigated in the current study.
The research highlights that splash dispersal is predominantly a local process, mainly effective over small distances. Most notably, direct dispersal from the source prevails over indirect re-splashing, with the latter contributing only minimally in our experiments (as shown in Fig. 3). Previous ground contamination had a negligible impact on dispersal through re-splashing, indicating that most dispersal occurs during single rain events. Direct dispersal from a spore source had the greatest effect, as more spores were released in single drops (illustrated in Fig. 2B). Although indirect dispersal via re-splashing contributed more drops at greater distances (as seen in Fig. 2A), it resulted in fewer spores being displaced (as shown in Fig. 2C).
In the following discussion, we will relate these findings to their implications for spore dispersal through rain events.
In the context of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides infecting yams, as well as more generally regarding splash dispersal, rain splash is known to occur at very small scales and results in shorter dispersal distances compared to wind. Our experiment did not examine the full range of splash dispersal; however, our findings confirm that the majority of spores dispersed by rain are spread over short distances from the inoculum. Since direct dispersal is heavily influenced by chance events, one might expect re-splashing events— which facilitate the further propagation of released spores— to eventually become more significant for dispersal than direct splashes.
Our experimental design enabled us to compare two components of dispersal: direct splash and indirect dispersal via re-splashes. Results indicate that indirect dispersal does not surpass direct dispersal, as direct splashes carry a significantly greater number of spores per drop compared to re-splashed drops. This study represents the first comparison of the efficiency between direct and indirect dispersal, meaning we cannot ascertain whether other species exhibit similar behaviors.
Different Colletotrichum species vary in their efficiency of direct splash dispersal depending on distance, likely due to differences in their mucilage matrix properties. Additionally, we may anticipate varying abilities to disperse through re-splashing, possibly influenced by factors such as spore size or shape and the hydrophilic characteristics of their cell walls, which may affect their adherence to forming splashes.
In the context of yam cropping, ridge interspacing falls within the direct dispersal distance. Consequently, ridges may intercept direct splashes and also reduce the efficiency of re-splashing. Staking further increases the likelihood of direct drops being intercepted. Both agronomic practices aim at managing productivity by optimizing space and concentrating production, while simultaneously facilitating the direct dispersal of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. As a result, the evolutionary pressure to enhance re-splash dispersal efficiency is diminished. It would be worthwhile to investigate whether the ability for re-splash dispersal varies among different pathogen species across various cropping systems.
Secondly, prior soil contamination had no detectable effect on spore dispersal in our experiment (Table 1). The presence of spores dispersed during previous rainfall did not significantly increase spore loads in subsequent rain events. This may be because spore density on the ground surface was too low to impact re-splashing, or because deposited spores were trapped on the surface. Such trapping could occur naturally, especially if spores bind to humus compounds. The paper sheets we used were highly fibrous, potentially mimicking humus-rich or mulched soils concerning trapping or retention effects. However, if other soil types have varying retention capacities, our observed lack of re-splash effects might be an artifact of the paper used and may not generalize to most crop conditions. It is also possible that the retention effect is strong regardless of soil type, meaning that few spores can be remobilized in subsequent rains.
Several studies highlight the importance of initial spore dispersal, but there may be a cost to landing or deposition. Spores that do not land on a suitable host may result in significant losses after direct dispersal, particularly losses that inhibit further indirect dispersal via re-splash. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is known for its very low survival rate in soils, even when it settles in decaying plant material, though it may survive longer on plant residues. Thus, we would expect dispersal to be effective only if spores quickly land on a new host. The pathogen's inability to survive outside its host likely contributes to the observed minimal impact of soil contamination on subsequent splash dispersal.
In summary, we demonstrated that direct dispersal from a source is the primary mode of spore dispersal by rain-splash, while indirect dispersal via re-splash has a smaller, albeit still contributory, impact on spore contamination. However, rain-splash dispersal is limited to individual rain events, and once spores have settled, subsequent rains do not seem to promote further dispersal. Prior soil contamination was not a significant factor in spore dispersal for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Although both rain and cover characteristics affect rain-splash dispersal, little is known about soil characteristics or the diversity in pathogen dispersal abilities via splashing. We suggest that this gap should be addressed in future experiments to enhance our understanding of rain splash dispersal.
