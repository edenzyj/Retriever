Although recently described, Colletotrichum boninense is well established in the literature as an anthracnose pathogen or endophyte of various host plants worldwide. It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognized here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii, and 12 previously undescribed species: C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae, and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are known only from New Zealand, possibly reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was established, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and renamed as C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening, which may extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, and conidia featuring a prominent basal scar. Many species in the C. boninense complex form teleomorphs in culture.

Capsicum, Citrus, Cucurbita, and Solanum species in New Zealand.
Worldwide, particularly among the Amaryllidaceae and Orchidaceae families, Lu et al. (2004) detected probable isolates of C. boninense in the Proteaceae and Solanaceae families. For example, C. boninense was found as an endophyte in the leaves of several tree species in the Iwokrama Forest, which were associated with diseases affecting Leucospermum. Reports also document C. boninense as an endophyte in Protea cynaroides in Australia and Zimbabwe, and with Eucalyptus, as noted by Pileggi et al. (2009), who isolated it from leaves in South Africa (Lubbe et al. 2004). In pathogenicity studies, C. boninense was shown to infect the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia in Brazil. Joshee et al. (2009) demonstrated its ability to infect the leaves and stems of Protea (Lubbe et al. 2006). Farr et al. (2006) studied foliar endophytes of Podocarpaceae and Myrtaceae trees, reporting C. boninense on Dracaena and Pachira in New Zealand and identifying several isolates belonging to the C. boninense group. Other isolates associated with anthracnose on tamarillo, Passiflora, and mango were found in Colombia (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003) and as endophytes in coffee plants from Colombia and Hawaii (Vega et al. 2010). According to Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005), C. boninense (synonymous with C. gloeosporioides groups E–I in Johnston & Jones 1997) occurs on a range of hosts.

Recent studies have detected various C. boninense species in blastn searches in GenBank. Yang et al. (2011) reported C. boninense from Pleione bulbocodioides and Oncidium flexuosum (Orchidaceae) in China, and described a related species, C. karstii, found on several orchids in China.
Conidia of C. boninense s. lat. are similar to those of C. gloeosporioides, differing slightly in their length/width ratio and the presence of a prominent scar at the base of the conidium (Moriwaki et al. 2003). Isolates of C. boninense have frequently been identified as C. gloeosporioides in previous studies (Moriwaki et al. 2002, 2003; Johnston et al. 2005). Von Arx (1957) listed approximately 600 synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and nine formae speciales, suggesting that some of these might refer to C. boninense.
The ITS1 phylogeny presented in Moriwaki et al. (2003) shows considerable infraspecific variation. Some strains accepted by these authors as C. boninense may actually belong to segregate species recognized in this paper. Lubbe et al. (2004) identified two subgroups but classified both as C. boninense. Phylogenetic analyses of strains from New Zealand (Johnston & Jones 1997; Johnston et al. 2005) revealed several clades, with some developing sexual morphs (see Hyde et al. 2009). These data suggest that C. boninense represents a species complex. In this paper, we characterize species within the C. boninense species complex morphologically and through multi-gene analysis.
Isolates comprised those previously identified as C. boninense, as well as other related cultures from the CBS culture collection. The type specimens of the species studied are located in the fungaria (dried fungus collections) of the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands; the Botanische Staatssammlung München (M), Germany; and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (K(M)), United Kingdom, which now incorporates the CABI dried collection (IMI). The culture dried down to serve as the epitype specimen of C. petchii was selected from the culture collection of the CBS. All descriptions are based on either the ex-holotype or ex-epitype culture. Features of other isolates are added if they deviate from the ex-holotype and ex-epitype isolates. Subcultures of the types and epitypes, as well as all other isolates used for morphological and sequence analyses, are maintained in the culture collections of CBS, IMI, and/or ICMP (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plants, Landcare Research, Auckland, New Zealand), and their data are presented in Table 1.
To enhance sporulation, 5-mm-diameter plugs from the margin of actively growing cultures were transferred to the center of 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes containing synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976), amended with autoclaved filter paper and double-autoclaved stems of Anthriscus sylvestris placed onto the agar surface. The strains were also studied after growth on oatmeal agar (OA; Crous et al. 2009) or 2% potato-dextrose agar (PDA; Difco). Cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements and photographs of characteristic structures were made according to methods described by Damm et al. (2007). Appressoria on hyphae were observed on the reverse side of colonies grown on SNA plates. Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure, and observed with a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope (DM) or with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. Colony characters and pigment production on SNA and OA incubated at 20 °C were noted after 10 days. Colony colors were rated according to Rayner (1970). Growth rates were measured after 7 and 10 days.
To determine whether the seven sequence datasets were congruent and combinable, we visually compared tree topologies based on 70% reciprocal Neighbour-Joining bootstrap with Maximum Likelihood distances (10,000 replicates). Substitution models for each partition were determined separately using MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004), following the methodology outlined by Mason-Gamer & Kellogg (1996). A maximum parsimony analysis was conducted on the multilocus alignment (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) using PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2000). The analysis employed a heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing data, and all characters were unordered and of equal weight. The robustness of the resulting trees was evaluated using 500 bootstrap replications with two random sequence additions (Hillis & Bull 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting trees. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) for the combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene, as determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3, were applied to each gene partition. Two MCMC chains were run from random trees for one million generations, with sampling every 100 generations. The likelihood scores for the two runs were 2,730 and 2,170. Consequently, the first 2,450 trees (the average of both) were discarded as part of the burn-in phase, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. Sequences derived from this study were deposited in GenBank, the alignment was submitted to TreeBASE (www.treebase.org), and taxonomic novelties were recorded in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004a).
The seven sequence datasets did not reveal any conflicts in tree topology for the 70% reciprocal bootstrap trees, allowing for their combination. In the multigene analyses (gene boundaries: ITS: 1–561, GAPDH: 572–864, CHS-1: 875–1154, HIS3: 1164–1562, ACT: 1573–1851, TUB2: 1862–2363, CAL: 2374–2823) involving 87 isolates of C. boninense and related Colletotrichum species, including the outgroup, a total of 2,823 characters, including alignment gaps, were processed. Out of these, 572 characters were parsimony-informative, 247 were parsimony-uninformative, and 2,004 were constant. After conducting a heuristic search using PAUP, 958 most parsimonious trees were retained (length = 1,423 steps, CI = 0.740, RI = 0.927, RC = 0.686, HI = 0.260), with one tree illustrated in Fig. 1. The topologies of the 958 trees were similar, verified by a large selection of trees; however, they differed in the position of taxa within subclades and the placement of strain CBS 130241. For the Bayesian analysis, the following substitution models were selected: HKY+G for ACT and CAL, SYM+I+G for ITS, K80+I+G for CHS-1, GTR+I+G for HIS3, and HKY+I for GAPDH and TUB2, which were incorporated into the analysis. The consensus tree from the Bayesian analyses confirmed the topology obtained through parsimony, as well as the bootstrap support (Fig. 1).
The analyses revealed 18 clades, which we accept as representing different Colletotrichum species. Notably, more than half of all strains included clustered in the first clade (C. karstii), which exhibited a bootstrap support of 96% and a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. Two clades represented single strains, indicating...
C. brasiliense consists of three and two strains, respectively, and these findings are well supported (100/1.00). They group (100/1.00) with a single-strain clade (C. parsonsiae). The C. constrictum clade (100/1.00), which contains two strains, along with the single-strain clade representing C. dacrycarpi, are on very long branches and group with a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00.
The individual alignments and trees of the seven single genes were compared concerning their performance in species recognition. With ITS and CHS-1, only 7 and 9 species can be recognized, respectively. For TUB2, some species closely related to C. boninense cannot be separated, while with HIS3 and CAL, some species differ by only one or two base pairs (bp) and form no or only short-branched clades. With GAPDH, all clades are recognized, but some are also short-branched, especially the single-strain clades C. beeveri and C. brassicicola, which are well differentiated from almost all other genes except for ITS. With ACT, intraspecific variability is quite high in some species, potentially leading to misidentifications.
The 86 isolates studied are assigned to 18 species within the Colletotrichum boninense complex based on DNA sequence data and morphology, including 12 species that are new to science. Ten species form teleomorph stages in vitro, four species have known anamorphs described in Colletotrichum, while one species, G. phyllanthi, has a known teleomorph and is identified here as belonging to the Colletotrichum boninense species complex. All species studied in culture are characterized below.
Species of Colletotrichum represent anamorphic stages of Glomerella. Under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants, anamorph and teleomorph names of fungi will have equal status with the deletion of Article 59, which takes effect on January 1, 2013. This decision includes a stipulation that the uptake of names of anamorphic genera that predate well-known competing teleomorphic names must be ratified by a committee of the International Commission for the Taxonomy of Fungi. The name Colletotrichum (Corda 1831) predates Glomerella (Spauld. & H. Schrenk 1903) and is more commonly used. Consequently, we name the new holomorphs as species of Colletotrichum without naming the new sexual morphs separately. Furthermore, G. phyllanthi is combined in Colletotrichum as C. phyllanthi. There is precedent for this, as Rojas et al. (2010) described Colletotrichum ignotum as having a teleomorph (see Rojas et al. 2010: figs 44–47, table III), although the teleomorphic structures were not included in the formal species diagnosis.
Colletotrichum annellatum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560734. Fig. 2.
Etymology: The name refers to the proliferation of conidiogenous cells, which appear annellate.
The teleomorph developed on SNA exhibits ascomata that are ovoid to obpyriform, medium to dark brown, measuring 180–220 × 100–150 µm, glabrous, ostiolate, with a neck that is hyaline to pale brown, and a wall thickness of 5–10 µm. The outer layer is composed of flattened, medium-brown angular cells, measuring 5–10 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses, which are hyaline, septate, branched at the base, and disintegrate quickly, measuring 35–55 µm in length, with a base diameter of 3–4.5 µm and a rounded apex. Asci are cylindrical to clavate, measuring 58–74 × 11–16 µm, with eight spores. Ascospores are arranged biseriately, hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical to narrowly fabiform, straight or rarely very slightly curved, with both sides rounded, measuring (13.5–)15–17(–18.5) × 5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.0 ± 1.1 × 5.6 ± 0.4 µm, and a length/width ratio of 2.9.
The teleomorph also developed on Anthriscus stems, with ascomata that are ovoid to obpyriform and medium brown. Asci are cylindrical to clavate, measuring 60–70 µm.
Table Description: The table in this context presents a list of 86 isolates assigned to the Colletotrichum boninense complex, detailing their distribution among 18 species based on DNA sequence data and morphological characteristics. It highlights that 12 of these species are newly identified. The table includes identifiers for various strains, indicating both their origins and the specific species classifications, thereby contributing to the understanding of the complex's diversity and the relationships between the species.

L–M: Ascomata. N: Ascospores. O: Paraphyses. P–R: Asci. S: Peridium in cross-section. T: Outer surface of peridium. A, C–E, J are from Anthriscus stem; B, F–I, K–T are from SNA. A–B, L are viewed under a dissecting microscope (DM), while C–K, M–T are under differential interference contrast illumination (DIC). Scale bars: A, L = 100 µm, M = 50 µm, C, N = 10 µm. Scale bar of A applies to A–B; scale bar of C applies to C–K; scale bar of N applies to N–T.
Ascospores are biseriately arranged, hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, straight, or rarely very slightly curved, measuring (13.5–) 14.5–17 (–19.5) × (5–) 5.5–6 (–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.8 ± 1.4 × 5.8 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
The anamorph develops on SNA, featuring vegetative hyphae that are 1.5–9 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores are not observed. Conidiomata are absent; conidiophores and setae form directly from vegetative hyphae or on a small cushion of hyaline to pale brown angular cells measuring 3–6 µm in diameter. Setae are pale to medium brown, smooth to verruculose (especially towards the tip), 2–4-septate, and range from 70–160 µm in length, with a cylindrical base that is sometimes slightly inflated (3.5–5.5 µm in diameter) and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to very pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching lengths of up to 80 µm.
Conidiogenous cells are also hyaline to very pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and sometimes extend to form new loci, measuring 4–22 × 4–5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette < 0.5 µm long, showing distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar. Their dimensions range from (11.5–) 13–15 (–15.5) × (5–) 5.5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.0 ± 0.9 × 5.7 ± 0.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.4. Appressoria are rare (only 8 observed), single, medium brown, and may have a roundish, elliptical, or bullet-shaped outline, with margins that are entire to undulate, measuring 5.5–9 (–11) × (4–) 4.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.3 ± 1.6 × 5.7 ± 1.0 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.3.
The conidia measure 14.7 ± 1.0 × 5.8 ± 0.3 µm, with a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 2.6.
Colonies grown on SNA are flat with an entire margin and are hyaline to pale honey-colored. When cultured on medium with Anthriscus stem and filter paper, they are partly covered with short, floccose, white aerial mycelium and have grey to black conidiomata, with the reverse exhibiting similar colors. The colonies measure 17.5–19.5 mm in diameter after 7 days (28–29.5 mm after 10 days). On OA, the colonies are also flat with an entire margin, buff, pale mouse-grey to greyish sepia, partly covered with floccose white aerial mycelium, and have salmon to black conidiomata. The reverse side is buff, olivaceous buff to olivaceous grey, measuring 19–20 mm in 7 days (30–31 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon.
Colombia, Meta, Villavicencio, from a leaf of Hevea brasiliensis, collected on 13 August 2010 by Olga Castro. The holotype is CBS H-20693, with the culture ex-type CBS 129826 = CH1.
This species is closely related to a clade that includes C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Colletotrichum annellatum has longer asci compared to C. karstii (58–74 µm versus 31.5–56 µm), wider ascospores, and smaller appressoria, which are rarely formed in C. annellatum. Colletotrichum phyllanthi did not produce anamorphic or teleomorphic structures under the growth conditions tested, complicating direct morphological comparisons. As indicated by its name, C. annellatum often produces conidiogenous cells with annellide-like proliferations on Anthriscus stems, whereas on SNA, conidiogenous cells predominantly exhibit distinct periclinal thickening.
Previously, two species within the genus Colletotrichum have been described from Hevea. Colletotrichum heveae Petch (Petch, 1906) has longer and wider conidia than C. annellatum (measured as 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm), and appears morphologically similar to the C. crassipes group as categorized by Sutton (1980). There are numerous distantly related Colletotrichum taxa with broad conidia, warranting further revisionary work (see Lubbe et al. 2004 and Cannon et al. 2012). A further species published in the same article is Gloeosporium heveae Petch. Many species formerly classified under this genus are now included in Colletotrichum, primarily differing in having sparse or absent setae (von Arx, 1970). Based on its description, G. heveae belongs to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate; its conidia measure 12–17 × 3.5–5 µm (narrower than those of C. annellatum) and its conidiogenous cells (“basidia”) measure 20–34 × 2 µm. Typification of either species is challenging. The only potential type material for both species in K includes a single packet labeled in Petch’s handwriting as “Gloeosporium brunneum Petch & Colletotrichum heveae Petch, no. 2228. On Hevea, 7 Oct. 1905; type of Colletotrichum heveae.” This packet contains two young leaves, apparently with only one fungus, which aligns with the description of G. heveae rather than C. heveae. The name G. brunneum Petch was never published (it would later become a homonym of G. brunneum Ellis & Everh., 1889), suggesting that Petch may have changed the species name between collection and publication. Consequently, Petch’s names cannot be definitively typified, but it appears that neither provides an earlier name for C. annellatum.
Most Colletotrichum isolates derived from Hevea plants have been found to belong to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes (Jayasinghe et al. 1997, Saha et al. 2002, Gazis & Chaverri 2010, Gazis et al. 2011, Damm et al. 2012). However, one isolate from Hevea guianensis in Peru possesses an ITS sequence that places it within the C. boninense species complex, closely related to C. karstii or C. phyllanthi (Gazis et al. 2011; GenBank HQ022474). The ITS sequence of C. annellatum differs by two base pairs from C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Additional research is necessary to clarify the taxonomic placement of the strain from Peru.
Etymology: Named after Ross Beever, a New Zealand mycologist and fungal geneticist, who collected the plant material from which this species was isolated.
Teleomorph: Not observed. On SNA, Anthriscus stem/filter paper and OA revealed closed round structures that could be undeveloped ascomata; neither conidia nor ascospores were produced.
Anamorph: Developed on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1.5–7 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent; conidiophores and setae formed directly from vegetative hyphae or on pale brown, thick-walled angular cells measuring 3–6.5 µm in diameter. Setae are dark brown, smooth-walled, 1–3-septate, and range from 50 to 100 µm in length, with a conical to slightly inflated base (5–6.5 µm in diameter) and an apex that is approximately acute. Conidiophores are pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 50 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 9–30 × 3.5–6.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, collarette less than or equal to 0.5 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, and granular or guttulate contents, often containing two large guttules, measuring (11.5–)12–14(–16) × 5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.2 ± 1.0 × 6.0 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.2. Appressoria are single, dark brown, irregular, often elliptical to navicular in outline, with lobate margins, measuring (5.5–)7.5–12.5(–14.5) × (4–)5.5–8.5(–9) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.1 ± 2.5 × 7.1 ± 1.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.4.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem: Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae forming on a cushion of medium brown, thick-walled angular cells, 3–10 µm in diameter. Setae (only a few observed at the margin of acervuli) are dark brown, smooth-walled, 2–3-septate, and range from 80 to 95 µm in length, with a conical to cylindrical base (4.5–6 µm in diameter) and a tip that is roundish to slightly acute. Conidiophores are pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, reaching up to 20 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, short cylindrical to ampulliform, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 9–15 × 4.5–5.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, collarette less than 0.5 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, and granular or guttulate contents, sometimes with two large guttules, measuring (12.5–)12–14(–15.5) × 5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.3 ± 0.8 × 6.0 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.4.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, with filter paper, Anthriscus stem, and partly agar medium covered with orange to black conidiomata, and filter paper partly covered with white mycelium; the reverse is hyaline with black spots mainly under the filter paper, measuring 22.5–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–37 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, buff, primrose to greenish olivaceous, with orange, dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata and partly with short floccose white aerial mycelium; the reverse is buff, pale purplish grey, primrose, greenish olivaceous to iron-grey with olivaceous grey spots due to the conidiomata/ascomata shining through, measuring 26.5–29 mm in 7 days (39–40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Material examined: New Zealand, Great Barrier Island, from brown lesions on a leaf of Brachyglottis repanda, R.E. Beever, 23 Mar. 2006, (CBS H-20694 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128527 = ICMP 18594).
No species of Colletotrichum has been previously described from Brachyglottis, and none of the species described from members of the Asteraceae family originate from Australasia. Sequence comparisons involving six genes indicated that C. beeveri (previously identified as C. boninense) was isolated as an endophyte from the healthy roots of Pleione bulbocodioides (Orchidaceae) in China (Yang et al., 2011). Additionally, several endophytic strains from the leaves of Podocarpaceae in New Zealand share the same or similar ITS sequences as C. beeveri (e.g., EU482210, EU482288, and EU482283; Joshee et al., 2009).
Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib., Mycoscience 44(1): 48. 2003. Fig. 4.
The teleomorph of C. boninense develops on oatmeal agar (CBS 123756). The ascomata are perithecia, which are variable in shape but usually subglobose to pyriform, glabrous, and medium brown, measuring 100–300 × 100–200 µm. These structures are ostiolate and periphysate, with a hyaline to pale brown neck that can reach up to 100 µm in length. The outer wall consists of flattened angular cells measuring 4–15 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue comprises irregular, thin-walled, hyaline, septate paraphyses. Asci form in a basal fascicle, are cylindric-clavate, measuring 45–60 × 12.5–17 µm, 8-spored, with a somewhat truncate apex and a small refractive apical ring. The ascospores start as hyaline and aseptate but develop into 1–3-septate forms, with septation occasionally occurring inside the ascus. They are light to medium brown, sometimes verruculose prior to germination, and allantoid in shape, measuring (12.5–)14–17(–18) × (4–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.6 ± 1.4 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9.
The anamorph develops on SNA (CBS 123755). Vegetative hyphae are 1–6 µm in diameter, hyaline or pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores have not been observed. Conidiomata are poorly or not developed, with conidiophores and setae arising directly from the hyphae. Setae are rare, medium brown, smooth to verruculose, 1–2-septate, measuring 20–60 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated base that has a diameter of 3–7 µm at its widest point and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline or pale brown, simple or septate, branched or unbranched, reaching up to 40 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline or pale brown, cylindrical, measuring 6–15 × 3–5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette of 0.5–1.5 µm long, exhibiting conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with a rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent hilum, often containing two large polar guttules, measuring (8.5–)11–14.5(–17.5) × (4–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.8 ± 1.6 × 5.4 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.4. Appressoria can be solitary or in short chains, medium brown, thick-walled, with entire or crenate edges, and are rarely lobate. They are smooth-walled and irregular in shape, often bullet-shaped or navicular with an acute tip, measuring (4.5–)7–14(–18) × (4–)5–8(–11) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.5 ± 3.3 × 6.4 ± 1.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.6.
The anamorph also develops on Anthriscus stems (CBS 123755). The conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae forming from a cushion of pale brown, roundish to angular cells measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are rare, medium brown, with the basal cell often paler, verruculose, and 1–2-septate, measuring 30–70 µm long, with a base that is cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated, having a diameter of 3.5–6.5 µm, and a tip that is approximately round to acute. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, and may be branched or unbranched, reaching up to 40 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, cylindrical to ellipsoidal, measuring 5.8–17 × 3.5–6 µm, with openings of 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette ≤ 0.5 µm long, with visible to conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and can be cylindrical to clavate, with a round apex and a base that is round with a prominent hilum, sometimes containing two large polar guttules, measuring (9–)12–14.5(–16.5) × (4–)5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.2 ± 1.4 × 5.8 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.3. The conidia of CBS 129831 are longer (up to 20 µm) with an average L/W ratio of 2.6.

Notes: Conidia of C. boninense are similar to those of C. karstii; however, the ascospores of C. boninense are more uniform with rounded ends, becoming brown and septate with age. The asci are also longer and wider. We recognize that there is significant genetic variation in C. boninense. Host plants of C. boninense s. str. are very diverse, including families such as Amaryllidaceae, Bignoniaceae, Podocarpaceae, Proteaceae, Solanaceae, and Theaceae. Several ITS sequences, such as HM044131 (Yuan et al., unpubl. data) from Oryza granulata and FJ449913 (Hu & Guo, unpubl. data) from Dendrobium sp., both presumably from China, are similar to the ITS of C. boninense, C. oncidii, and C. cymbidiicola. However, these species cannot be separated from each other by comparing their ITS sequences.
Etymology: Named after Brazil, where it was collected.
The teleomorph was not observed. The anamorph was identified on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–5.5 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, approximately thin-walled, angular cells measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. In strain CBS 128528, conidiophores and setae are formed directly on hyphae. Setae are sparse, pale to medium brown, with the basal cell usually paler, smooth to finely verruculose, 2–4-septate, measuring 50–60 µm long. The base is cylindrical to conical, 6–8 µm in diameter, and the tip is ± acute to slightly roundish or zigzag-shaped.
Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, and can be simple or septate and branched, measuring up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ellipsoidal, and encased in a mucous sheath. These cells sometimes extend to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–14 × 4.5–7.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter. The collarette is visible and ≤ 0.5 µm long, with periclinal thickening evident. In strain CBS 128528, conidiogenous cells are longer (12–25 µm) and the periclinal thickening is conspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with both the apex and base rounded, featuring a prominent scar. Their dimensions are (11.5–) 13–16(–18) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 1.6 × 5.4 ± 0.2 µm, resulting in an L/W ratio of 2.7. Conidia of strain CBS 128528 are longer, measuring (13.5–) 14–19(–22.5) × (4.5–) 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.5 ± 2.4 × 5.3 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in an L/W ratio of 3.1.
Appressoria are medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, lobed, often with a roundish outline but sometimes triangular, measuring (5.5–) 7–16(–32) × (4–) 6.5–13(–24) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.5 ± 4.5 × 9.7 ± 3.3 µm, yielding an L/W ratio of 1.2.
The anamorph was observed on an Anthriscus stem. The conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–8 µm in diameter. Only one seta was observed, which is medium brown, smooth-walled, 3-septate, and 65 µm long. The base is cylindrical, measuring 4.5 µm in diameter, with a tip that is ± acute and zigzag-shaped. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, measuring up to 20 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ellipsoidal, and sometimes extend to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 6–12 × 3.5–7.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter. The collarette is 1 µm long, with visible periclinal thickening.

Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with the apex and base rounded and a prominent scar. Their contents are granular or guttulate, measuring (13–) 13.5–16(–19) × (4.5–) 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.8 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.8. Conidia from strain CBS 128528 are longer, measuring (13–) 14–19(–22.5) × (4–) 4.5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.7 ± 2.5 × 5.1 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.3.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, and pale cinnamon near the Anthriscus stem. On Anthriscus stem, they are covered with orange to black conidiomata. The filter paper is partly rosy buff, grey to black, and covered with white mycelium and grey to black conidiomata; the reverse exhibits similar colors with black spots mainly beneath the filter paper, measuring 21–21.5 mm in 7 days (32.5–33.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, buff, and turn greenish olivaceous toward the center with orange to black conidiomata, lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse is buff, grey olivaceous to olivaceous grey towards the center, measuring 21.5 mm in 7 days (32–33.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear orange.
Material Examined: Brazil, São Paulo, Bauru City, from fruit anthracnose of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa, 1 June 2006, N. Massola and H.J. Tozze Jr. (CBS H-20697 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128501 = ICMP 18607 = PAS12); São Paulo, Bauru City, from fruit of Passiflora edulis, 1 June 2006, N. Massola and H.J. Tozze Jr., CBS H-20696, culture CBS 128528 = ICMP 18606 = PAS10.
Notes: There are four species in the C. boninense species complex known to occur on Passiflora: C. brasiliense from Brazil (on fruits), C. colombiense from Colombia (on leaves), C. torulosum from New Zealand (on leaves), and C. karstii from Japan and Colombia (on leaves) and Brazil (on fruits). According to Johnston & Jones (1997), C. gloeosporioides Group E (= C. novae-zelandiae) and C. gloeosporioides Group I (= C. constrictum) have also been isolated from Passiflora, although this has not been confirmed by molecular methods. Colletotrichum brasiliense and C. colombiense are currently known only from Passiflora. C. brasiliense is documented only in Brazil, where it causes anthracnose of yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa; Tozze et al. 2010). It is closely related to C. parsonsiae and C. hippeastri, distinguished by most genes, including ITS, although the CHS-1 sequence of one isolate was identical to that of C. parsonsii. Appressoria exhibit a lower L/W ratio (1.2) compared to other species in this group.
Numerous records exist for Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium, and Glomerella species on Passiflora (Farr & Rossman 2011). Two Colletotrichum and two Gloeosporium species have been previously described from Passiflora. Gloeosporium passiflorae Speg., described from Passiflora sp. in Argentina, forms longer conidia (20–30 × 5–6 µm) than any species in the C. boninense complex known from Passiflora (Spegazzini 1899). Conidia of C. passiflorae Siemaszko, described on leaves of Passiflora edulis in Transcaucasia (now Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), are smaller, measuring 14–25 × 4–6 µm (Siemaszko 1923). Most species discussed here have shorter conidia. Only conidia of C. brasiliense isolate CBS 128528 sometimes exceed 20 µm, but their average length is 16.5 µm, with an L/W ratio of 3.3, differing from the 3.5–4.25 range implied by Siemaszko’s measurements.
The name Gloeosporium passifloricola Sawada (originally published as "passifloricolum") was introduced for a fungus found on Passiflora quadrangularis in Taiwan (Sawada 1943). However, this name was invalidly published and does not threaten any of the species presented in our paper.
Etymology: Named after the host plant genus, Brassica.
Description: The teleomorph developed on Anthriscus stems. Ascomata are globose to subglobose, pale brown, measuring 100–250 × 90–150 µm, glabrous and ostiolate, with a neck that is hyaline to pale brown. The outer wall is composed of flattened angular cells, measuring 8–19.5 × 5.5–15.5 µm. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses; these are hyaline, septate, and branched, measuring 55–100 × 4–8 µm. Asci are cylindrical, measuring 65–105 × 12–13.5 µm, and contain 8 spores. Ascospores (only 7 observed) are arranged biseriately, hyaline, aseptate, fusiform, sometimes broader on one side, occasionally curved, smooth, measuring (15–) 17.3–21(–24) × (3.5–)4–5.5(–7) µm, with a mean ± SD of 19.1 ± 1.8 × 4.8 ± 0.8 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.0. On filter paper, ascospores measure (16.5–) 18–22.5(–23.5) × 4.5–5.5(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 20.3 ± 2.4 × 5.1 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.0.
The anamorph developed on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are poorly developed, with conidiophores and setae forming directly on hyphae. Setae are medium brown, verruculose, 1–3-septate, 30–70 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated base measuring 4–6.5 µm in diameter at the widest part and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline or pale brown, smooth to verruculose, clavate, cylindrical, or doliiform, sometimes lacking a basal septum and continuous with the conidiophore, measuring 7–14 × 4–5.5 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter and collarettes 0.5–1(–1.5) µm long, exhibiting conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, ovoid with a rounded apex and base, sometimes featuring a prominent scar or containing one or two large guttules, measuring (9.5–)11–13.6(–17.5) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.2 ± 1.4 × 5.6 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.2. Appressoria range from pale to dark brown, crenate to lobed, measuring (5.5–)7.5–14.5(–21) × (4.5–)6–9.5(–12.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.1 ± 3.6 × 7.8 ± 1.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.4.
The anamorph also developed on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae forming from a cushion of hyaline to pale brown, angular cells, measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, often paler at the base, smooth to verruculose, 1–2-septate, measuring 25–60 µm long, with a base that is cylindrical to conical, often slightly inflated, measuring 4–7.5 µm in diameter, and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, clavate to ellipsoidal, measuring 5–16 × 3.5–5 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter and collarettes 0.5–1 µm long, exhibiting visible to conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to clavate, with a rounded apex and base featuring a prominent scar, often guttulate and sometimes containing one or two large guttules, measuring (9–)11.5–13.5(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.4 ± 1 × 5.6 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.2. On filter paper (less often observed on Anthriscus stems), dark brown to black, roundish closed conidiomata are formed, measuring up to 400 µm in diameter and opening by irregular rupture. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and irregularly shaped, possibly deformed due to pressure inside the conidiomata, measuring (7.5–)10–14.5(–18) × (4.5–)5–7(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.2 ± 2.3 × 6.2 ± 0.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.0.
Material examined: New Zealand, Manawatu-Wanganui, Ohakune, from leaf spots of Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera, unknown collection date (July 1998 deposited in CBS collection), B. Thrupp (CBS H-20698 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 101059 = LYN 16331).
Notes: The conidia of C. brassicicola are very short, whereas ascospores and asci are longer than those of the other four species in the C. boninense species complex with a known sexual morph. Farr & Rossman (2011) list six Colletotrichum taxa associated with Brassica species: C. truncatum, C. capsici (treated as a synonym of C. truncatum by Damm et al. 2009), C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, C. gloeosporioides var. minor, and C. higginsianum. Colletotrichum truncatum and C. dematium have curved conidia and belong to separate clades that are not closely related to C. boninense (Damm et al. 2009). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has noticeably longer conidia than species in the C. boninense complex (Sutton 1980, 1992; Weir et al. 2012). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor was reported on Brassica oleracea in Australia (Simmonds 1966) with narrower conidia (11.1–17.7 × 3.1–5.0 µm) and shorter ascospores (13.5–16.8 × 3.5–4.9 µm) (Simmonds 1968) than C. brassicicola. Weir et al. (2012) confirm C. gloeosporioides var. minor as belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex and describe it as a new species, C. queenslandicum. Colletotrichum higginsianum (O’Connell et al. 2004) is part of the C. destructivum complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue) and has longer conidia that tend to be inaequilateral.
Vassiljewski and Karakulin (1950) described Colletotrichum brassicae on Brassica as having slightly curved, fusoid conidia that are longer (19–24 µm) than those of C. brassicicola. Colletotrichum brassicae was regarded as a synonym of C. dematium (von Arx 1957), but no authentic material has been seen.

An isolate on Passiflora sp. from Colombia (Pass-65, Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003) has the same ITS sequence as C. brassicicola, and isolates from leaves of Podocarpus totara and Prumnopitys ferruginea in New Zealand (Joshee et al. 2009) differ by only two or three substitutions in ITS sequences. We cannot be sure whether these strains belong to C. brassicicola or to other segregates of the Colletotrichum colombiense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560738.
Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Colombia.
With a prominent scar, the contents are granular or guttulate, often featuring two large guttules. The dimensions are (11.5–)12–14(–15.5) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.1 ± 1.0 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.3. Appressoria are single, medium to dark brown, and roundish to elliptical, with undulate to lobate margins, measuring (5.5–)6–10(–12.5) × (3.5–)4.5–7.5(–10) µm, mean ± SD = 7.8 ± 2.0 × 6.0 ± 1.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3. Appressoria from strain CBS 129817 are larger, measuring (7–)7.5–14.5(–21.5) × (5–)6–10(–12.5) µm, mean ± SD = 11.0 ± 3.5 × 8.1 ± 1.9 µm, also with an L/W ratio of 1.3.
The anamorph is found on Anthriscus stems, with acervular conidiomata formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells (3–8 µm in diameter). Setae are medium brown, verruculose, 1–3-septate, 35–110 µm long, with a cylindrical to strongly inflated base (3.5–8.5 µm diameter) and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, reaching up to 40 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, sometimes surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, occasionally extending to form new loci, measuring 7–26 × 3–5.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm diameter, collarettes < 0.5 µm long, and visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar, contents granular or guttulate, (11–)12–14.5(–15) × (5–)5.5–6 µm, mean ± SD = 13.1 ± 1.1 × 5.7 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.3.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to pale honey-colored, with medium containing Anthriscus stem and filter paper partly covered with very short, white aerial mycelium; the reverse is similar in color, measuring 24–25 mm in 7 days (34–35 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, buff, honey to isabelline, partly covered with salmon, grey to black conidiomata, with aerial mycelium lacking; the reverse is buff to olivaceous grey, measuring 26–26.5 mm in 7 days (37–39 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon.
Material examined: Colombia, Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, from a leaf of Passiflora edulis, 22 Jan. 2010, D. Riascos, (CBS H-20699 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129818 = G2); Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, from a leaf of Passiflora edulis, 5 Nov. 2009, D. Riascos, CBS H-20700, culture CBS 129817 = G1.
Notes: Sequences of C. colombiense form a sister group to C. beeveri and C. brassicicola. It differs from C. beeveri in morphology by its verrucose and rounded setae, as well as shorter conidiogenous cells. Other species isolated from Passiflora exhibit pigmented conidiogenous cells (C. brasiliense and C. karstii in the media used here) or much more complex appressoria (C. torulosum). See under C. brasiliense for discussions of previously published Colletotrichum taxa associated with Passiflora.
Numerous other isolates from Passiflora sp. in a study by Afanador-Kafuri et al. (2003) share the same or similar ITS sequence as C. colombiense but cannot be identified based solely on ITS due to the close relationship of the three species.
Colletotrichum constrictum Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560739.
Etymology: The name refers to the shape of the ascospores, which are often constricted.
Teleomorph on Anthriscus stem. Ascomata are perithecia, formed after 4 weeks. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering at both the apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 60–75 × 15–17 µm, with a broadly truncate base. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, and have the same shape as those formed on SNA, measuring (13–)16.5–19.5(–21) × (6.5–)7–8(–9) µm, with a mean ± SD of 18.0 ± 1.7 × 7.6 ± 0.6 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.4.
Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–8 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent; conidiophores and setae are formed directly from vegetative hyphae or from a reduced cushion of pale brown, angular cells, measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are pale to medium brown, verruculose, 1–4-septate, measuring 65–130 µm long, with a cylindrical base that is sometimes slightly inflated, measuring 4.5–6.5 µm in diameter, and an approximately acute tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, aseptate or septate, branched, and can be up to 70 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–20 × 3–7.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter, a collarette of ≤ 0.5 µm, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar. Their dimensions are (8.5–)12–15(–16) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.3 ± 1.5 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.3. In strain CBS 128503, occasionally globose to subglobose conidia are observed, measuring 9–13 × 7–13 µm. Appressoria are single or in small groups of 2–3, medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, and ovate, bullet-shaped, navicular, or clavate in outline, with an undulate to lobate margin, measuring (5–)7.5–12(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–7.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.7 ± 2.4 × 6.5 ± 1.1 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are acervular, and conidiophores and setae are formed from a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells measuring 2.5–8 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, with a basal cell that is often paler, verruculose, 2–4-septate, measuring 70–150 µm long, with a cylindrical base that is conical to ± inflated, measuring 3.5–6.5 µm in diameter, and an acute tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, aseptate or septate, branched, and can be up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–15 × 3.5–7 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter, a collarette of < 0.5 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent hilum, and the contents appearing granular to guttulate, measuring (13–)14–15.5(–16) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 0.7 × 5.4 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, and pale cinnamon, resembling Anthriscus stem, which is covered with orange to black conidiomata and ascomata. The filter paper appears partly rosy buff, grey to black, covered with white mycelium and grey to black conidiomata/ascomata; the reverse exhibits the same colors, with black spots mainly under the filter paper, measuring 15–21 mm in 7 days (30.5–32.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, rosy buff, olivaceous to black with dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata, featuring a central area that is orange due to sporulation and partly covered with short white aerial mycelium; the reverse is buff, vinaceous buff to dark mouse-grey, measuring 24–28 mm in 7 days (35–37.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear orange in mass.
Material examined: New Zealand, AK, Auckland, from the fruit of Citrus limon (lemon), collected on 1 Dec. 1988 by P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20701, holotype; culture ex-type CBS 128504 = ICMP 12941); from ripe fruit rot of Solanum betaceum (tamarillo), collected on 1 June 1988 by P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20702; culture CBS 128503 = ICMP 12936).
Colletotrichum constrictum was previously referred to as the C. gloeosporioides group I by Johnston & Jones (1997) and is only known from New Zealand. The isolates studied here are from Citrus species and Solanum betaceum. According to Johnston & Jones (1997), the species also occurs on Passiflora edulis and P. mollissima, although this has not been confirmed by molecular methods.

The peridium is 10–12 µm thick, composed of pale to medium brown flattened angular cells 3.5–15 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, delicate, and rarely visible. Interascal tissue is not observed. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical, tapering at both ends, smooth-walled, measuring 40–48 × 9.5–11 µm, with a truncate base and an apex that is 3.5–4 µm wide. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, fusiform, slightly curved, with a rounded base and an acute or rounded apex, measuring (12.5–)15–18(–21) × 5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.5 ± 1.6 × 5.6 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.0.

Interascal tissue is formed of paraphyses, hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, disintegrating quickly, septate, branched, measuring up to 70 µm long and 3–5.5 µm wide. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical, tapering at both ends, smooth-walled, measuring 55–77 × 11.5–13.5 µm, with a truncate base. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to fusiform, slightly curved, typically with one end broadly rounded and the other end (which is widest and more curved) often acute, giving the ascospores a footprint-like appearance, measuring (15–)17.5–25(–31) × 5–6(–7) µm, with a mean ± SD of 21.2 ± 3.9 × 5.5 ± 0.6 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.9.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem: The conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown angular cells measuring 3–8 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, verruculose to verrucose, 1–4-septate, ranging from 75 to 180 µm in length; the base is cylindrical to strongly inflated (4–10 µm in diameter), and the tip is approximately rounded to acute. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, and may extend to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–13 × 5.5–7 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter. The collarette is ≤ 0.5 µm in diameter, and the periclinal thickening is conspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base featuring a prominent scar. Their dimensions are (11.5–)13.5–15.5(–16.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 0.9 × 5.7 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to honey-colored, partially covered with floccose-felty white aerial mycelium. Anthriscus stems and filter paper are partly covered with grey to black conidiomata, oozing salmon to orange conidia; the reverse side is hyaline to honey, with filter paper showing grey to black spots from conidiomata. The colony diameter is 25–26.5 mm in 7 days (37.5–40 mm in 10 days). On OA, colonies are flat with an entire margin, buff to straw-colored, with sectors covered either by granular white aerial mycelium or black conidiomata, also oozing salmon to orange conidia; the reverse is buff, straw, honey, isabelline, olivaceous grey to iron-grey, measuring 25–27.5 mm in 7 days (40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Material examined: In Australia (Western Australia, Perth, Fremantle), from a leaf lesion of Cymbidium sp., collected on 27 Mar. 1991 by P.M. Wood (CBS H-20703 holotype, culture ex-type IMI 347923). In New Zealand (AK, Mangere), from a leaf spot of Cymbidium sp., collected on 22 Mar. 1990 by P. Broadhurst (CBS H-20704, culture CBS 128543 = ICMP 18584). In Japan (Ibaraki Pref.), from Cymbidium sp., collected in 1989 by T. Sato (culture CBS 123757 = MAFF 306100).
Notes: Colletotrichum cymbidiicola belongs to one of several clades of the C. boninense aggregate associated with orchids and is a sister group to C. oncidii, another clade of orchid pathogens. Based on the limited samples available, both species appear to be host-specific at the plant genus level. A notable feature of C. cymbidiicola is the considerable difference in size and shape of the ascospores and conidia when grown on Anthriscus stem compared to cultures on SNA. Colletotrichum oncidii did not produce a teleomorph under the given culture conditions, and its conidia are longer in relation to their width when grown on Anthriscus stem compared to SNA cultures, though the difference is less pronounced. Colletotrichum cymbidiicola differs from C. boninense in having lobate, irregularly shaped appressoria, while C. boninense features typically bullet-shaped to navicular appressoria with entire or crenate edges.

On Anthriscus stem, conidiomata are globose and appear to open by rupture, with wall cells that are medium brown and angular, measuring 7–20 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching lengths of up to 50 µm, developing from a cushion of medium brown, angular to rounded cells measuring 3.5–12 µm in diameter. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7.5–23 × 3–5 µm. The openings are 1.5–2.5 µm in diameter, with collarettes not observed and periclinal thickening present. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with a round apex and base, containing granular to guttulate content, measuring (13–)15.5–19.5(–24) × 5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.3 ± 2.0 × 5.5 ± 0.3 µm and a length/width ratio of 3.2.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, hyaline to honey-colored, exhibiting white floccose aerial mycelium and grey structures, with orange conidial masses in the center. The reverse is hyaline, honey to pale salmon, with dark grey spots due to conidiomata or ascomata shining through, measuring 10.5–12.5 mm in 7 days (17.5–20 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with entire margins, rosy buff to pale flesh with a buff margin, covered with sepia to black conidiomata or ascomata and orange conidia masses in the center, and very sparse white aerial mycelium. The reverse is buff to rosy buff, measuring 11–12.5 mm in 7 days (16–17.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are orange.
Material examined: New Zealand, Auckland, Wenderholm Regional Park, leaf endophyte from Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (kahikatea), 16 Oct. 2009, G. Carroll, (CBS H-20705 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 130241 = ICMP 19107).
Notes: No Colletotrichum species had been described from Dacrycarpus species (Podocarpaceae) prior to this study. Colletotrichum dacrycarpi does not resemble a typical member of the genus, exhibiting slow growth and producing conidia within closed fruit bodies with ruptured walls. These closed fruit bodies have been noted in several other species within the C. boninense complex, and the extension of conidiogenous cells to form new loci is characteristic of species within this complex. Colletotrichum dacrycarpi is one of the most basal members of the overall clade and forms a sister group to the morphologically distinct C. constrictum. In all single-gene phylogenies, C. dacrycarpi is situated on a long branch. BLASTn searches with ITS sequences found no close matches.

The conidiogenous cells are pale brown, becoming hyaline toward the tip, smooth or verruculose, and cylindrical. They are surrounded by a gelatinous sheath composed of several layers, measuring 13–27.5 × 4–6.5 µm, with an opening diameter of 1.5–2.5 µm. The collarette and periclinal thickening are not visible. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with both apex and base rounded. Their cytoplasm appears granular, measuring (19–)24.5–32.5(–37.5) × (5.5–)6–7.5(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 28.5 ± 4.1 × 6.8 ± 0.6 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.2. Strain CBS 241.78 forms shorter and broader conidia, measuring (10.5–)17–31.5(–40) × (6–)6.5–8(–8.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 24.4 ± 7.3 × 7.2 ± 0.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.4. Appressoria are dark brown, irregularly shaped, and strongly nodose, measuring (8.5–)10–20(–32) × (5.5–)7.5–12.5(–15) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.9 ± 5.0 × 10.0 ± 2.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
On Anthriscus stem, conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of medium brown, angular to rounded cells measuring 3.5–12 µm in diameter. Setae are pale brown, darker toward the base, smooth, and very thick-walled, measuring 1–6-septate. The septa are concentrated toward the base, and the setae range from 50–150 µm in length, with bases that can be cylindrical, conical, or inflated, measuring 5.5–10 µm in diameter and ending in a rounded tip. Conidiophores are pale to medium brown, septate, branched, and up to 70 µm long. Conidiogenous cells may extend to form new conidiogenous loci; they are pale to medium brown, smooth, cylindrical, and surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, measuring 12–28 × 4.5–5.5 µm, with an opening of 1.5–2 µm in diameter. The collarette and periclinal thickening are not observed. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and have granular content, measuring (14.5–)18.5–30(–39) × (5–)6–8(–9) µm, with a mean ± SD of 24.2 ± 5.8 × 6.9 ± 0.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.5.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with a fimbriate margin (individual hyphae visible at the margin), hyaline with floccose white to very pale grey aerial mycelium on Anthriscus stem and filter paper medium, with black structures (possibly non-functional ascomata) visible in the center and on the Anthriscus stem; they grow 29–34 mm in 7 days (35–38 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is covered with floccose pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, mainly at the margin, along with grey to black structures in the center; the reverse side is smoke grey to olivaceous grey, measuring 30–33 mm in 7 days (40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Growth rates for CBS 125377 are as follows: SNA: 28 mm in 7 days (37 mm in 10 days), OA: 30.8 mm in 7 days (40 mm in 10 days).
Material examined: China, Guizhou Province, Guiyang, isolated from a leaf of Hippeastrum vittatum, 23 May 2009, Y.L. Yang, culture ex-holotype CBS 125376 = CSSG1. Netherlands, isolated from a leaf of Hippeastrum sp., deposited in CBS from Plantenziektenkundige Dienst Wageningen in May 1978, culture CBS 241.78.
Notes: Colletotrichum hippeastri is an outlying species in the C. boninense clade, distinguished from related species by its large conidia and elongate, complex appressoria. A common feature with others in the complex is the conidiogenous cells covered in a gelatinous sheath, which was not mentioned in the original description by Yang et al. (2009). Phylogenetically informative sequence differences were not detected in the studied strains, and the species forms a distinct cluster within all single-gene phylogenies.
Colletotrichum karstii Y.L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Cryptogamie Mycologie 32: 241. 2011. Fig. 12.
Teleomorph on SNA: Ascomata are perithecia that form after 4 weeks, solitary, either superficial or immersed in the agar medium. They are non-stromatic, globose to obpyriform, ostiolate, periphysate, glabrous, medium brown, and paler towards the ostiole, measuring 90–130 × 90–200 µm, with a neck up to 90 µm, though usually much shorter. The peridium is 6–10 µm thick, composed of 3–5 layers of pale to medium brown flattened textura angularis with cells ranging from 3.5 to 12 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth, delicate, and rarely visible. The interascal tissue consists of paraphyses that are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly cylindrical but tapering towards the rounded tip. These paraphyses disintegrate quickly, are septate, constricted at the septa, apically free, and measure 30–50 × 4.5–7 µm. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering at both apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 37–56 × 9–12 µm (with asci of isolate CBS 128550 reaching up to 65 µm long). The base is broadly truncate, with a basal septum measuring 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter. Ascospores are uni- or biseriately arranged, initially aseptate but often septate with age, hyaline, smooth-walled, variable in shape, fusiform to ovoid, and slightly curved, measuring (11.5–)13–16.5(–18.5) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.7 ± 1.8 × 5.0 ± 0.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9. Ascospores from isolate CBS 128550 are larger, measuring (14.5–)16–18(–18.5) × (3.5–)4.5–6(–6.5) µm.
Teleomorph on PDA: Ascomata are approximately globose to obpyriform, reaching about 275 µm in diameter, ostiolate, periphysate, and reddish brown with a glabrous surface. The outer wall is composed of irregular reddish brown polyhedral cells measuring 10–20 µm in diameter. Asci are 8-spored, narrowly clavate, unitunicate, and fasciculate. Ascospores are allantoid to pyriform, inaequilateral, often straight on the inner side, with rounded apices tapering towards the base, measuring 14–19 × 4.0–7.5 µm, and are 1-celled and hyaline, arranged biseriately.
Anamorph on SNA: Vegetative hyphae measure 1–5 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores form directly from vegetative hyphae. CBS 129833 produces brown, roundish closed conidiomata that open by irregular rupture; the wall is composed of textura intricata, covered with brown, verrucose to warted hairs/hyphae measuring 3–3.5 µm wide, with conidiophores lining the inner wall. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth, septate, and strongly branched, reaching up to 100 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline or pale brown, smooth, cylindrical to elongate-ampulliform, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 9–20 × 3–5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette less than 0.5 µm in diameter, and conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent hilum approximately 1 µm in diameter, and measuring (11.5–)12.5–14(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.1 ± 0.7 × 5.8 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.2. Conidia from CBS 111998 can sometimes be longer (up to 18.5 µm, L/W ratio = 2.8). Appressoria are single or in small groups of 2–3, pale to medium brown, often navicular to bullet-shaped, not nodose, smooth-walled to undulate, measuring (4.5–)6–12(–16.5) × (2.5–)4–7(–10) µm, with a mean ± SD of 8.9 ± 2.9 × 5.4 ± 1.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.7. Appressoria from CBS 129833 are larger, measuring (5.5–)7.5–13(–17) × (4.5–)5.5–8.5(–10.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.3 ± 2.6 × 7.1 ± 1.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.4.
Anamorph on PDA: After 4 weeks under near UV light, the conidia are straight and cylindrical, rounded at both ends, featuring a hilum-like protuberance at the base, which is somewhat larger than that on SNA, measuring 14.5–17.0 × 5.0–6.5 µm.
On SNA: The colonies are flat with an entire margin, hyaline in color, with filter paper and Anthriscus stem covered in orange conidiomata and partially with white mycelium. The reverse is hyaline with grey flecks mainly under the filter paper, measuring 23.0–27.5 mm in 7 days (36.5–40 mm in 10 days).
On OA: The colonies are flat with an entire margin, exhibiting colors from buff to rosy buff to pale salmon, covered with orange to grey conidiomata and lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse is buff to rosy buff to honey, measuring 23.0–26.5 mm in 7 days (35.5–38 mm in 10 days).
On PDA: After 4 weeks under near UV light, the colonies display grey to white aerial mycelium at the center and in dispersed tufts, with numerous dark conidiomata scattered across the surface. The reverse is colorless to pale orange with numerous dark flecks corresponding to the ascomata. The conidia in mass appear orange.

Notes: Sequence comparisons with six genes (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, TUB2, CHS-1) indicate that 46 of the isolates in this study group with C. karstii (not shown). Colletotrichum karstii was recently described from a leaf of Vanda sp. (Orchidaceae) in China and has been reported on several other orchids (Yang et al. 2011). It is known to occur on many host plants and is the most common and geographically diverse species in the C. boninense complex. Previously, Colletotrichum karstii was referred to as C. gloeosporioides groups F and G by Johnston & Jones (1997), who also listed Persea americana and Cucurbita spp. as host plants. Earlier works have cited isolates of C. boninense that are now identified as C. karstii, including those detailed in the original description (Morikawi et al. 2003), some in Farr et al. (2006), and all in Lubbe et al. (2004). Additionally, some isolates from Passiflora edulis in Brazil that caused anthracnose on passion fruits (Tozze et al. 2010) were identified as C. karstii based on GAPDH sequences (GenBank accessions FJ949450 and FJ949452, not included in the phylogeny).

Sequence and morphological variability is high, with differences in conidium size and conidiomatal structures ranging from sporodochial to acervular to closed. This variability complicates identification based solely on morphology. The conidia of C. karstii are smaller than those of C. hippeastri and C. dracaenae, and broader than those of C. phyllanthi. The asci are shorter than those of C. brassicicola and C. dracaenae, and the shape of the ascospores differs from C. boninense, being slightly wider and less tapered.
Some strains exhibit morphological features that differ slightly from those of strain CBS 127597. Strain CBS 129833 produces larger asci (190–220 × 140–170 µm) and brown, roundish closed conidiomata that open through irregular ruptures, covered with brown, verrucose to warted hairs or hyphae that measure 3–3.5 µm wide. Additionally, the setae are more frequent, shorter (40–80 µm long), and broader at the base (5–7.5 µm in diameter). The appressoria are larger, measuring (5.5–)7.5–13(–17) × (4.5–)5.5–8.5(–10.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.3 ± 2.6 × 7.1 ± 1.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.4. This strain and CBS 111998 also exhibit slower growth than the type: on SNA, they grow 20–22.5 mm in 7 days (32–34.5 mm in 10 days) and 20.5–22.5 mm in 7 days (30.5–31.5 mm in 10 days); on OA, they measure 21.5–23.5 mm in 7 days (33.5–35 mm in 10 days) and 15.5–16.5 mm in 7 days (25–27 mm in 10 days). There are indications that CBS 129833 is phylogenetically distinct from the main body of C. karstii strains, though the sequence differences are slight.
Colletotrichum novae-zelandiae Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560742.
Etymology: Named after the country from which it was collected, New Zealand.
Teleomorph not observed. Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1.5–10 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores have not been observed. Conidiomata are absent; conidiophores are formed directly from vegetative hyphae or from angular to roundish, hyaline, thick-walled cells, measuring 3–8 µm in diameter. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can be up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to somewhat inflated, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, which gives them a catenate appearance; they can also be polyphialidic, measuring 4.5–20 × 4–6 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter and a conspicuous periclinal thickening.
Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and possess a prominent scar; their contents are granular or guttulate, measuring (12.5–)13–14.5(–15.5) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.8 ± 0.7 × 5.4 ± 0.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6. Appressoria were rarely observed (8 in total), medium to dark brown, roundish with an undulate margin, occurring singly or in small clusters, measuring 3.5–8 × 4–5.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 5.9 ± 1.5 × 5.1 ± 0.6 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.1. Appressoria of strain CBS 130240 were also few in number (8 observed), measuring 7–12.5 × 5.5–7.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.2 ± 2.0 × 6.7 ± 0.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
The anamorph is found on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae forming on a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells measuring 3.5–7 µm in diameter. Setae are dark brown, smooth to finely verruculose near the tip, 2–3-septate, measuring 90–140 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or inflated base that is usually paler, measuring 4.5–6.5 µm in diameter, and the tip is ± acute to rounded. Conidiophores are pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can be up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, smooth-walled, broadly cylindrical, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–15 × 4–6 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette of 1 µm in diameter, and conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and a prominent scar; their contents are granular or guttulate, measuring (12–)13–15(–15.5) × (4–)5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.1 ± 0.8 × 5.4 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6.
Material Examined: New Zealand, Gisborne, from ripe fruit rot of Capsicum annuum (sweet pepper), 1 Mar. 1990, P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20706, holotype; culture ex-type CBS 128505 = ICMP 12944); Auckland, from fruit of Citrus sp. (grapefruit), 2 Aug. 1988, P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20707; culture CBS 130240 = ICMP 12064).
Notes: Colletotrichum novae-zelandiae is morphologically indistinguishable from other species in the C. boninense species complex. It forms a separate lineage or cluster in all single-gene phylogenies, sister to a group including C. karstii, C. petchii, C. annellatum, and C. phyllanthi. This species is known only from New Zealand, where it has been isolated from ripe fruit of Capsicum and Citrus. Johnston & Jones (1997) identified this species as part of the C. gloeosporioides group E, indicating that it was frequently isolated from Citrus fruits and also found on Passiflora edulis, although there was no molecular confirmation.
The closest match in BLASTN searches (99% identity) was EU670082, the ITS sequence of "Glomerella acutata" strain S43 from Prunus dulcis (almond) in Australia. That strain was isolated alongside C. acutatum and shown to cause lesions on almond fruits in a pathogenicity test (McKay et al. 2009). It was initially morphologically identified as C. acutatum by the authors and later recognized as C. boninense using molecular data.
Teleomorphic structures were observed in mated cultures of some strains from Citrus spp., which likely belong to C. novae-zelandiae, but their identity has not been confirmed by sequencing. Ascomata develop on PDA after 14 days in tight clumps of 4–5, usually located along the margins between colonies. They mostly lack an obvious neck or feature a short, broad, hyaline ostiolar neck. Asci were not observed. Ascospores are aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, fusiform to ovoid, usually straight but sometimes slightly curved, with measurements ranging from 12.5–19 × 5.5–7 µm (C1019.1 × C1041.19) to 16–22.5 × 4.5–7 µm (C1010.18 × C1015.3). No teleomorphic structures were observed in cultures derived from single conidia.
Colletotrichum oncidii Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560743. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Oncidium.
Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–7.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, with conidiophores and setae formed directly from hyphae. Setae are medium brown, with a paler basal cell, verruculose, 2–5-septate, measuring 65–120 µm long, sometimes branched, with a cylindrical base of 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter and an acute to rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 75 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–23 × 3.5–5.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, and a collarette of ≤ 0.5 µm in diameter, with conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and a prominent scar, measuring (11.5–)13–15.5(–17.5) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.4 ± 1.3 × 5.5 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.6. Appressoria are medium to dark brown, with a variable outline, usually lobate, occurring singly or in loose groups, measuring (5.5–)8.5–16(–21) × (4–)5.5–10(–13) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.2 ± 3.8 × 7.8 ± 2.2 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.6.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale to medium brown, angular cells, 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, verruculose, 2–5-septate, measuring 75–210 µm long, with a base that is cylindrical to slightly inflated, 3.5–7 µm in diameter, and a tip that is rounded to acute. Conidiogenous cells disintegrate quickly, making their structure difficult to determine. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, and a prominent scar, measuring (14–)15–17(–17.5) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.0 ± 0.8 × 5.4 ± 0.2 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.0.
Material Examined: Germany, Munich, greenhouse; from leaf of Oncidium sp., 20 Nov. 2010, U. Damm (CBS H-20709 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129828); Munich, greenhouse; from leaf of Oncidium sp., 20 Nov. 2010, U. Damm, CBS H-20708, culture CBS 130242.
Notes: Colletotrichum oncidii forms a sister group to C. cymbidiicola, both of which are orchid pathogens recorded from the Asia-Pacific region rather than Europe. The known isolates of C. oncidii were from plants in greenhouses, and the ultimate origin of the species remains uncertain. It exhibits well-developed, strongly setose conidiomata in culture, with pale conidia and conidiogenous cells that extend to form new conidiogenous loci.
Colletotrichum oncidii differs from the closely related C. boninense by forming appressoria that are larger and lobate, while those of C. boninense are entire or crenate. Additionally, C. oncidii has longer setae (SNA: 65–120 µm, Anthriscus stem: 75–210 µm) that are 2–5-septate on both media, whereas those of C. boninense are only 20–60 or 30–70 µm long and 1–2-septate. No teleomorph is known.

The peridium is composed of pale to medium brown, flattened textura angularis with cells measuring 5–16 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses, which are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly cylindrical but tapering towards the rounded tip, disintegrating quickly, septate, and apically free, measuring 50–70 × 3–4 µm. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering to both apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 70–80 × 10–13 µm.

Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–7 µm in diameter. Setae are pale to medium brown, with the basal cell often paler, smooth-walled, 2–4-septate, measuring 50–150 µm long, with a base that is cylindrical to conical, 4–6 µm in diameter, and tips that are ± acute to rounded. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 45 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, and sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 10–25 × 3–5.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, and collarettes ≤ 0.5 µm long, with periclinal thickening sometimes distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, visible hilum, and guttulate contents, measuring (12.5–)16.5–20.5(–21.5) × 5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 18.5 ± 1.8 × 5.4 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.4. Appressoria are in loose groups to dense clusters, medium to dark brown, navicular, bullet-shaped to ellipsoidal in outline, smooth, and crenulate to lobate, measuring (7.5–)10–16.5(–22.5) × (4.5–)5.5–8(–10.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.2 ± 3.3 × 6.6 ± 1.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.0.
Anamorph on Anthriscus Stem: Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of pale brown cells.
Angular, thick-walled cells measuring 4–10.5 µm in diameter. Setae are dark brown, with the basal cell sometimes being paler, smooth-walled to verruculose, 2–4-septate, and ranging from 60–200 µm long. The base is cylindrical to conical, with a diameter of 4.5–7.5 µm and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, and surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 4–16 × 3–4.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter. The collarette is ≤ 0.5 µm long, and periclinal thickening is distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base; the hilum is visible, and the contents are guttulate, measuring (15–)16.5–19(–20) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.6 ± 1.3 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.2.
Culture Characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, with filter paper and medium partly covered with salmon to grey conidiomata, and Anthriscus stems covered with white aerial mycelium. The reverse is hyaline to honey with salmon to grey flecks, measuring 20–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–34 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, buff, fawn to rosy buff with dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata, and partly with floccose white aerial mycelium. The reverse is buff to fawn with olivaceous grey spots due to the conidiomata/ascomata shining through, measuring 22–26.5 mm in 7 days (35–37.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Material Examined: New Zealand, Auckland, leaf endophyte from Parsonsia capsularis, collected on 1 Dec. 2009 by G. Carroll (CBS H-20710 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128525 = ICMP 18590).
Notes: Colletotrichum parsonsiae is known from a single collection on Parsonsia capsularis in New Zealand. There are no Colletotrichum species described on Parsonsia, and no records of any Colletotrichum species on Parsonsia in the USDA Fungus-Host database (Farr & Rossman 2011). The shape and size of the conidia differ from other species in the C. boninense complex. Conidia are shorter than those of the closely related C. hippeastri, but longer than those of all other species. The conidial width is the same or less, resulting in comparatively high L/W ratios, especially on Anthriscus stem (L/W ratio = 3.7).

≠ Colletotrichum dracaenae Allesch., in Rabenhorst, Rabenh. Krypt.-Fl. (Leipzig) 7: 560. 1902.
Etymology: Named after Thomas Petch (1870–1948), an English mycologist and plant pathologist who discovered this species but described it under a previously existing name, Colletotrichum dracaenae.
Teleomorph on Anthriscus Stem: Ascomata are perithecia, globose to subglobose, approximately 200 × 150 µm, ostiolate, glabrous, with a short hyaline to pale brown neck. The outer wall consists of medium to dark brown verruculose angular cells measuring 6.5–11(–17) × 9–16(–20) µm. Interascal tissue is composed of paraphyses; these are hyaline, septate, and apparently unbranched, with the basal cells being strongly inflated, measuring 45–50 × 13–15.5 µm. Asci are clavate, with the apex ± truncate and a well-developed refractive apical ring, measuring 45–85 × 12–15.5 µm, containing 8 spores. Ascospores are arranged biseriately, hyaline to pale brown, aseptate, narrowly ovoid to fusiform, and slightly inaequilateral, smooth, without a gelatinous sheath, measuring (14.5–)16–18.5(–20) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.2 ± 1.3 × 5.7 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.0.
The appressoria are irregular in shape, dark brown, sometimes nodose, and not formed in chains. Their dimensions range from (4.5–) 8.5–15.5(–19) × (5–) 6–10(–13) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.0 ± 3.4 × 7.9 ± 2.0 µm, and a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 1.5.
The anamorph occurs on the stem of Anthriscus. The conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–10 µm in diameter. Setae are medium to dark brown, often with a paler base, smooth to finely verruculose, 1–2(–3)-septate, and range from 50–130 µm in length. The base is conical or inflated, measuring 5–10 µm in width, and the tip is round to somewhat acute. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, and can grow up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, smooth, cylindrical or conical, with annellations observed on some cells, measuring 9–16 × 4.5–6 µm. They open at 1–2 µm in diameter, with a collarette ≤ 0.5–1 µm long and conspicuous periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, and sometimes slightly constricted in the middle. Their dimensions are (12.3–) 14.5–18(–21.1) × (5–) 5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 16 ± 1.8 × 6 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
Colonies on SNA are flat with entire to slightly undulate margins, hyaline, featuring woolly white aerial mycelium on filter paper and SNA medium, as well as salmon to orange acervuli on both media and black ascomata on the Anthriscus stem. The reverse on filter paper appears buff to pale cinnamon, with acervuli shining through the medium. The growth rate is 23.8–25 mm in 7 days (33–35.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat, with entire to slightly undulate margins; the surface is buff to rosy buff, with sectors covered by grey to black structures or orange spore masses, alongside woolly white aerial mycelium in the center. The reverse is buff to cinnamon, with grey to black structures shining through the medium, exhibiting a growth rate of 20–25 mm in 7 days (33–36.3 mm in 10 days). Conidia appear in mass as salmon to orange.

Conidia of C. petchii are larger than those of C. boninense and C. brassicicola. Conidia, ascospores, and asci are usually larger than those of C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Conidia of C. hippeastri are larger, while C. dracaenophilum also occurs on Dracaena spp. but is not closely related to C. petchii, as demonstrated by Farr et al. (2006), which included CBS 118193 and CBS 118774 (C. petchii). Another species from Dracaena, C. dracaenae-fragrantis, has narrower conidia measuring 5–12 × 2.5–3.5 µm (Saccardo 1895); its affinities remain unclear.
Von Arx (1957) considered both C. dracaenae Allesch. and C. dracaenae Petch to be synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Farr et al. (2006) agreed with this conclusion regarding C. dracaenae Allesch. after studying type material, although their primary focus was on distinguishing C. dracaenae from their new species, C. dracaenophilum. The shape of the conidia of C. dracaenae is similar to that of C. gloeosporioides, including the overall length and the constriction in the central part. However, the conidia in C. dracaenae were found to be noticeably wider compared to those of “typical” C. gloeosporioides.
The original description by Allescher (1902) of the conidia of C. dracaenae Allesch. (14–18 × 5–7 µm, elongate-cylindrical, both sides rounded) aligns well with the species as defined here. Most characteristics of the setae also correspond (40–60 µm long, obtuse tip, few septa, appearing late at the margins of conidiomata), except for their diameter (2.5–3.5 µm according to Allescher; 5–10 µm in the CBS strains measured here). In the type material, we found that the conidia measured (12.5–) 13.5–16 × 5–6 µm (n = 20, mean ± SD = 15.2 ± 1.1 × 5.4 ± 0.3 µm, L/W ratio 2.8), which is smaller than those of the epitype of C. petchii, yet with a comparable L/W ratio. Few conidia exhibited a noticeably prominent hilum, and the setae were found to be narrow (as observed by Allescher) and slightly verruculose. It is uncertain whether Allescher’s collection and the CBS isolates represent the same species, as comparisons with dried material and living cultures are challenging. Given that the conidial hilum morphology seems to differ from that seen in C. petchii (a diagnostic feature of the C. boninense aggregate), we have chosen not to use Allescher’s name.
Part of the type of C. dracaenae Petch was examined by Farr et al. (2006), who noted that the fruit bodies had a very thin subhymenial layer, only one or two layers thick. No further observations were made, and it is possible that the material they examined was degraded. Upon re-examination of the type, we found conidiomata typical of the C. boninense aggregate. In line with Petch’s original description, the setae are strongly curved and tapering, becoming strongly verruculose towards the tip. Few conidia were observed, and those present were variable in shape and length/width ratio. The majority measured 14–16 × 5–6.5 µm, cylindrical to doliiform, with a rather prominent hilum. We confidently place Petch’s illegitimate taxon within the C. boninense aggregate, and it is reasonable to consider it synonymous with C. dracaenae Allesch. Petch (1925) contrasted his species with C. cordylines Pollacci but appeared unaware of Allescher’s work.
In contrast to other species in the C. boninense complex, C. dracaenae may be host-specific to Dracaena. The majority of Dracaena species are native to Africa, with some in southern Asia and one in tropical Central America, and they are often cultivated as pot plants or in greenhouses. The host species of the isolates studied here are popular houseplants. Colletotrichum dracaenae was primarily isolated from leaves, where it caused leaf spots, as indicated in the sampling details of some of the isolates (Di Lenna & Montecchio 1995). Within the species, there is low sequence variability, with separate clusters obtained in all phylogenetic analyses employing single genes.
Colletotrichum phyllanthi (H. Surendranath Pai) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB560746. Basionym: Glomerella phyllanthi H. Surendranath Pai, Mycopath. Mycol. appl. 42: 70. 1970.
Material Examined: India, Maharashtra, Poona, from leaf anthracnose on Phyllanthus acidus, 10 Feb. 1966, H. Surendranath Pai, IMI 122826, holotype; Maharashtra, Poona, isolated from anthracnose symptoms on leaves of Phyllanthus acidus, 10 Feb. 1966, H. Surendranath Pai, CBS H-7188, isotype, dried culture (PDA) of ascigerous stage, culture ex-isotype CBS 175.67 = MACS 271.
Notes: Glomerella phyllanthi is known only from the original collection taken from leaves of Phyllanthus acidus in India. The ex-type strain CBS 175.67, deposited in the CBS collection, did not sporulate under standard growth conditions. The description below is derived from the original publication (Pai 1970).
“Perithecia isolated or gregarious, dark brown, 159–190.8 µm with long beaks measuring 47.7–150 µm. Ostiolar threads absent. Asci numerous, unitunicate, clavate, octosporous, arising in basal layers, sessile to subsessile, 43.2–56.6 × 8.6–10.8 µm. Paraphyses abundant in early stages but disintegrating at maturity. Ascospores uniseriate or irregularly biseriate, elliptical to slightly curved, hyaline with oil globules at both ends, 12.9–17.28 × 2.1–6.4 µm.” Ascospore measurements from the isotype (CBS H-7188) agree with those of the original description: (14–)14.5–17(–18) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) µm, mean ± SD = 15.7 ± 1.1 × 5.1 ± 0.6 µm, L/W ratio = 3.1. Pai (1970) assumed that G. phyllanthi was the teleomorph of Colletotrichum heveae and did not provide a complete description of the anamorph, offering the following information: acervuli 113–159 µm, setae (only formed in old cultures) 63–143 µm, conidia cylindrical, oblong, 14–17 × 3–5 µm. No anamorph structures could be observed in the holotype or isotype specimens.
According to its original description, conidia of Glomerella phyllanthi are narrower than those of other species within the C. boninense complex, and none formed ascomata with a long beak as reported for G. phyllanthi. However, it must be recognized that the culture medium and growth conditions were not the same. According to the multigene phylogeny, G. phyllanthi forms a separate lineage close to C. karstii. This was also the case in 5 of 7 single-gene phylogenies.
Glomerella phyllanthi causes anthracnose disease on leaves of Phyllanthus acidus in India (Pai 1966) but has not been reported since. Farr & Rossman (2011) list C. gloeosporioides from Phyllanthus emblica in China (Zhuang 2001) and P. reticulatus in Myanmar (Thaung 2008), as well as an unidentified Colletotrichum sp. from P. acidus in India (Mathur 1979), of which at least the latter could be identical with G. phyllanthi.

Pai (1970) regarded C. heveae Petch as the anamorph of G. phyllanthi on the basis of the teleomorph strain being pathogenic to four of six Euphorbiaceae plant species tested, including Hevea brasiliensis, along with general morphological similarity. The conidium size of C. heveae was given as 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm by Petch (1906), which was incorrectly cited by Pai (1970) as 18–24 × 5–8 µm.
Diseases of Hevea in South India caused by Colletotrichum species are attributable to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum aggregates (e.g., Saha et al. 2002; unpublished ITS sequences from this research deposited in GenBank confirm these identifications to species aggregate level). A species on Hevea from Colombia closely related to C. phyllanthi is described in this paper (see C. annellatum).
Colletotrichum torulosum Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560747. Fig. 17.
Etymology: Named in recognition of the highly convoluted nature of its appressoria.
Anamorph on SNA: Vegetative hyphae are 1–7.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores and setae are formed directly from hyphae. Setae are medium brown, with the basal cell paler, verruculose, 2–5-septate, measuring 65–120 µm long, sometimes branched; the base is cylindrical, 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter, and the tip is ± acute to ± rounded. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 75 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 8–23 × 3.5–5.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter, a collarette ≤ 0.5 µm in diameter, and conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar and an apparently verrucose vesicle attached to it, with contents that are granular. The dimensions are (13–)14–17(–21) × 5.5–6.5(–7.5) µm, with a mean ± SD = 15.5 ± 1.5 × 6.0 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6. Conidia of strain CBS 102667 are shorter, measuring (10.5–)12–14.5(–17.5) × (4.5–)5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD = 13.4 ± 1.2 × 5.8 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.3. Appressoria are medium to dark brown, with a variable outline and lobate margin, occurring singly or in loose groups, measuring (5.5–)8.5–14.5(–16.5) × (4.5–)6–9.5(–13) µm, with a mean ± SD = 11.4 ± 2.9 × 7.7 ± 1.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem: Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–10 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed in strain CBS 128544. Setae of strain CBS 102667 are medium brown, with the basal cell paler, verruculose, sometimes verrucose, 0–2-septate, measuring 20–60 µm long; the base is cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated, with a diameter of 4.5–6.5 µm, and the tip is rounded. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 60 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 9–23 × 4.5–6.5 µm, with an opening of 1.5–2.5 µm in diameter, a collarette ≤ 0.5 µm in diameter, and conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar, and contents that are guttulate. The dimensions are (13.5–)14.5–16.5(–17.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD = 15.5 ± 0.9 × 5.8 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7. Conidia of strain CBS 102667 are shorter, measuring 12–14.5(–18) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD = 13.4 ± 1.3 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.3.
Material examined: New Zealand, GB, Gisborne, Allen Park Gardens, from Solanum melongena (eggplant), 6 Mar. 1990, P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20715 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128544 = ICMP18586); Auckland, Mount Albert, from leaf blotch of Passiflora edulis, May 2000, C.F. Hill, CBS H-20716, culture CBS 102667.
Notes: Colletotrichum torulosum occupies a minor clade as sister to a group containing C. boninense s. str. and an unnamed taxon that occurs on orchids (CBS 123921). It has significantly longer conidia than C. boninense with a larger L/W ratio. The conidia formed on SNA have hyaline, faintly verrucose vesicles attached to the base adjacent to the conidial scar. The function of these structures is unclear, and they may be artifacts. These vesicles also occur on conidia of C. cymbidiicola (Fig. 9R).
Moriwaki et al. (2003) differentiated C. boninense from C. gloeosporioides based on its wider conidia (length/width ratio = (1.8–)2–3(–3.3)), the prominent scar at the conidial base, and the cream to orange-colored colonies on PDA. The length/width ratio of conidia of C. boninense s. str. and C. karstii (included in C. boninense by Moriwaki et al. 2003) varies, ranging from 2.1 to 2.8 depending on the isolate (and medium), while conidia of C. gloeosporioides have a length/width ratio of 2.6 to 3.0 (Cannon et al. 2008, Weir et al. 2012). According to Moriwaki et al. (2003), the shape of the appressoria in C. boninense differs from that seen in C. gloeosporioides, and setae are rarely produced in C. boninense. Many strains belonging to the C. boninense aggregate exhibit more complex appressoria than those typical for C. gloeosporioides.
None of the morphological characters of C. boninense allow for unequivocal identification, and misplacement of strains based solely on morphology is common. For instance, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological features but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study indicates that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. but rather to the C. boninense species complex, although its conidia largely resemble those of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio.
Conidiogenesis in the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes is typically percurrent, though it is more variable in C. boninense, depending on the site of septation in the conidiogenous cell, which results in a prominent periclinal thickening. Occasionally, distinct annellations form, commonly seen in C. annelatum and occasionally in C. dacrycarpi and C. petchii. After producing several conidia, the conidiogenous cells of many species extend without forming a septum and create a new conidiogenous locus at the tip. These processes can alternate, making the conidiogenous cell appear catenate, as observed in C. constrictum, C. novae-zelandiae, and C. oncidii. Additionally, several species exhibit a gelatinous multi-layered coating around the conidiogenous cells.
Differentiation between the two species complexes using morphological methods is problematic; however, the diagnostic characters established by Moriwaki et al. (2003) can reliably identify many isolates. A distinctive feature of the C. boninense complex in morphological terms is the conidiogenous cell with a prominent periclinal thickening that extends to form a new conidiogenous locus, which is unknown in species of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012). Another notable characteristic of the C. boninense complex is the prominent scar (hilum) at the base of the conidia.
Species of the C. boninense complex appear to be concentrated in certain regions of the world and prefer specific host plants. Isolates discussed in this paper and found through nucleotide BLAST searches of GenBank mainly originate from New Zealand/Australia, South and East Asia (Japan, China, Taiwan, Thailand, Vietnam, India), South and Central America (Colombia, Brazil, Panama, Mexico, Guyana), and South and East Africa (South Africa, Zimbabwe, Kenya). A number of isolates from Europe (Italy, Netherlands, Germany, and probably Hungary) have been associated with indoor/greenhouse plants (such as Dracaena, Hippeastrum, and Gossypium species, as well as several orchids) or air from greenhouses containing orchids (Magyar et al. 2011). A few samples from Coffea arabica and Leucospermum originated from the USA (Hawaii), and one sample from Protea obtusifolia was sourced from Madeira (Portugal).
Sampling bias likely explains why certain Colletotrichum species complexes exhibit varying levels of host specificity across different regions. In some complexes, such as those examined by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Damm et al. (2009), there is little or no evidence of host specificity at the species level. However, others, like the C. graminicola and C. orbiculare complexes, appear to be closely associated with specific host genera and/or families (Crouch et al. 2009, Liu et al. 2007).
Some segregate taxa within the C. boninense complex indicate host specificity or at least a preference for particular plant groups. For example, Morikawi et al. (2003) identified four molecular subgroups within the species based on ITS1 data. The primary branch differentiated strains from monocotyledonous (monocot) and dicotyledonous (dicot) plant hosts. While the dicot clade did not exhibit any clear substructure linked to host specificity, the monocot clade comprised three subclades: one was restricted to Orchidaceae, while the other two contained strains from Crinum (Amaryllidaceae). The dicot clade corresponds to C. karstii, as recognized in this paper, whereas the monocot clade includes C. boninense s. str. Our research does not support this division. Although C. karstii is found on a variety of dicots, it has also been observed on Orchidaceae and other monocots, particularly Musa spp. Among the other segregate species we recognize, C. dracaenae and C. hippeastri appear to be specific at the host genus level, though the number of strains we have examined remains insufficient to confirm this.
Many strains within the C. boninense aggregate exhibit the ability to produce a teleomorph. In contrast, the Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum have been inadequately studied compared to their anamorphs. Von Arx & Müller (1954) conducted a global revision based on morphological characters, and Uecker (1994) completed an ontogenetic study of a single C. gloeosporioides isolate. Evidence suggests that strains from most principal species aggregates, including the C. acutatum group (Guerber & Correll 2001; Guerber et al. 2003; Marcelino et al. 2008), the C. destructivum group (Armstrong-Cho & Banniza 2006, linked to an anamorph misidentified as C. truncatum), the C. orbiculare group (Rodriguez-Guerra et al. 2005), and the C. graminicola group (Crouch et al. 2009), can undergo meiosis.
The Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum species are morphologically uniform, with ascospore size and shape being the only features attributed any diagnostic value. However, there is considerable overlap in the published dimensions, making it impractical to distinguish the sexual structures of the C. boninense aggregate from those of other groups using morphological methods alone.
C. karstii and C. boninense are represented by many isolates, with C. karstii exhibiting the widest host range and distribution. Most strains isolated as endophytes belong to C. karstii, although this species also includes strains derived from diseased plant tissues. Further research is needed to understand the life strategies and host-parasite relationships of fungi in this clade.
A detailed study of the C. boninense complex has revealed that even recently recognized species of Colletotrichum may obscure extensive molecular variation and may contain multiple taxa with distinct evolutionary origins. The ongoing debate regarding whether these segregate taxa should be classified at the species or infraspecific level (Cannon et al. 2008) remains unresolved. However, recent trends favor recognizing them as independent species. This approach simplifies nomenclature but may limit practical value for applied mycologists and plant pathologists, as the names do not necessarily indicate host specificity or nutritional/biological strategies. Unfortunately, many of these species cannot currently be reliably identified using single diagnostic (barcoding) sequences, making this aspect of their systematics a high priority for future research. On a positive note, there is now significantly more information regarding the phylogenetic components of the C. boninense complex.
