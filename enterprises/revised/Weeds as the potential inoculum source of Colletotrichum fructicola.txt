Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan. We hypothesized that various weeds growing in and around strawberry fields serve as inoculum sources for this disease. Additionally, we investigated the effect of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on these weeds.
The fungus was detected on 31 out of 541 leaves sampled from 13 weed species between 2005 and 2008, resulting in a detection rate of 5.7%. The highest isolation frequency was found in leaves of Amaranthus blitum (17.9%), where inoculation with the pathogen resulted in brown leaf spots. Other weeds, such as Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Solidago altissima, Erigeron annuus, and Sonchus oleraceus, also harbored the fungus but at lower rates (4.3% - 8.1%) without showing symptoms. Notably, C. fructicola formed acervuli on the leaves of A. blitum, D. ciliaris, and S. oleraceus after glyphosate treatment. These findings indicate that infected weeds in association with strawberry cultivation can be significant inoculum sources for C. fructicola, especially following herbicide application.

Introduction: The spread of strawberry anthracnose can be exacerbated by the use of infected runner plantlets (Hirayama et al. 2010). Effective management strategies must consider these factors to mitigate disease outbreaks.
The occurrence of strawberry anthracnose in Nara and Chiba prefectures has been documented in various studies (et al. 2004; Peres et al. 2005; Van Hemelrijcka et al. 2010). This disease was widespread in western Japan during the late 1970s (Gan et al. 2017). The pathogen Colletotrichum fructicola, along with other anthracnose pathogens, primarily infects nurseries and can latently infect runner plantlets, leading to the transmission of the disease from nurseries to production fields (Hirayama et al. 2016; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994). Most commonly grown strawberry cultivars are susceptible (Mori 1998), and the rise of fungicide-resistant strains complicates disease control (Inada et al. 2015). Therefore, eradicating the pathogen from nurseries is crucial to preventing disease incidence.
The pathogen Colletotrichum acutatum, another major anthracnose pathogen, latently colonizes weeds such as Vicia sp. and Conyza sp., as well as crops like pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean (Freeman et al. 2001). However, the latent infection of weeds by C. fructicola has not been extensively studied concerning disease epidemiology. We also hypothesized that herbicide applications could predispose weeds to C. fructicola infections. Indeed, acervuli of C. truncatum formed more rapidly on herbicide-treated plants than on untreated ones (Cerkauskas et al. 1983).
The purpose of this study was to investigate weeds as a potential inoculum source for C. fructicola. Our specific objectives were: (1) to isolate the pathogen from various weed species around strawberry fields; (2) to determine the pathogenicity and infectivity of the pathogen on these weed species; and (3) to clarify the growth of the pathogen on weeds treated with the herbicide glyphosate.
In terms of materials and methods, the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex isolates to strawberry was assessed by detecting the anthracnose fungus from weeds. A total of 541 weed leaves were collected from 12 strawberry nurseries in Nara from 2005 to 2008. Leaf samples were cleaned in running tap water for 3 minutes, surface-sterilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol for a few seconds, followed by treatment in 2% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 minutes, and rinsed with sterilized distilled water. They were then air-dried.
Conidia formed on 7-day-old PDA cultures were suspended in sterile distilled water and adjusted to a concentration of 10^6 conidia/mL. A 10 µL aliquot of the conidial suspension was applied to intact leaflets of the strawberry cultivar Asukaruby.

The culture medium contained 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.1% (w/v) bactopeptone, 1% (w/v) sucrose, 0.25% (w/v) MgSO4•7H2O, 0.27% (w/v) KH2PO4, 2% (w/v) agar, 2.5 mg a.i. of iprodione (Rovral WP, Bayer CropScience, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1% (v/v) lactic acid, and 25 mg ampicillin per liter of distilled water (Freeman et al. 2001). The cultures were incubated at 25 °C for 7 days in the dark, after which Colletotrichum colonies were selected based on their microscopic characteristics. Single-spore cultures of Colletotrichum species were established by streaking onto water agar.
Pathogenicity tests on weeds were conducted by investigating disease occurrence in the next cultivation season. The weeds inoculated for this test included Amaranthus blitum L., Digitaria ciliaris (Retz.) Koeler, Galinsoga ciliata Blake, Sonchus oleraceus L., and Portulaca oleracea L. Weed seedlings at the 3- to 5-leaf stage of growth were collected from a field where strawberries had not been previously cultivated and were transplanted into 300-mL plastic pots containing nursery soil (TM-1, Takii Seed, Kyoto, Japan). These plants were confirmed to be free of C. fructicola using Mathur’s medium. Control plants used were Asukaruby strawberry plants with three leaves.
Colletotrichum fructicola isolates Nara-gc5 (MAFF 245243) and 19002 (MAFF 306782) from strawberries were tested. These isolates were naturally resistant to benomyl (50 mg a.i./L, Benlate WP, Sumitomo Chemical, Osaka, Japan) on Mathur’s medium. The C. fructicola isolates were cultured in 200 mL Erlenmeyer flasks containing 100 mL of potato sucrose broth (200 g sliced potato, 20 g sucrose, and 1 L distilled water) on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm at 25 °C for 10 days.
A table outlines the detection frequency of Colletotrichum fructicola from various weed species in different localities over multiple years. It lists the date, locality, weed species, detection frequency of C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and the percentage of pathogenic isolates. The data shows various weed species and their association with the pathogens, with percentages indicating the frequency of detection and pathogenicity. For instance, in November 2005 in Kashihara, 60% of samples were detected, with 21.7% being pathogenic. In contrast, other locations showed varied results, with some years reporting no pathogenic isolates at all.
Data Table Description: The data table presents information on various weed species collected from strawberry fields, detailing the presence of the pathogen Colletotrichum fructicola. It lists specific weed species alongside their corresponding codes and parameters, including counts of conidia and percentages. For instance, "Kashiba 2" has codes representing its weed types and shows a conidial presence of 6.3% across four recorded parameters. The table also includes data for "Kouryo" and "Katuragi" species, indicating varying levels of pathogen infection. At the bottom, a total is provided, summarizing that 31 out of 541 samples tested positive for C. fructicola over the study period from 2005 to 2008, which represents a 5.7% detection rate. The species codes listed include names such as Amaranthus blitum, Galinsoga ciliata, and Solidago altissima, among others. Additionally, the presence of C. gloeosporioides complex is noted, with a detection frequency of 15.9% from the leaves tested.
conidia/mL, and then applied to potted plants. Each plant received 10 mL of the suspension and was covered with plastic bags to maintain 100% humidity. Control plants were treated with sterile water. Symptoms of anthracnose were recorded, and infection confirmation was done using Mathur's medium seven days post-inoculation. The experiment was replicated three times with three plants per replicate.
The experiment involved incubating samples in the dark at 25°C for seven days, estimating the number of C. fructicola conidia based on colony-forming units (CFUs). Pathogen identification was confirmed through benomyl resistance on modified Mathur's medium, and the experiment was repeated five times with five plates per treatment. Microscopic observations also confirmed the conidia formed on leaves as C. fructicola.
conidia/mL. The plants were kept in a greenhouse, receiving irrigation twice daily. Leaves were sampled at various intervals, sterilized, and divided into segments for analysis.
Overall, the study found that the presence of C. fructicola on weeds increased the likelihood of disease in strawberries during subsequent cultivation seasons. All isolates tested positive for typical disease symptoms on strawberry plants, while control plants remained symptom-free.
The experiment assessed the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola on various weed species and its influence on strawberry plants. It was found that C. fructicola is not pathogenic on strawberries. Among the weed species tested, Amaranthus blitum exhibited the highest infection rate, with 17.9% affected by C. fructicola (see Table 2). Other weeds, such as Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Solidago altissima, Erigeron annuus, and Sonchus oleraceus, showed relatively low detection rates (4.3% to 8.1%) without displaying symptoms. Notably, C. fructicola was not isolated from the remaining seven weed species, which included Senecio vulgaris, Cyperus microiria, Lamium amplexicaule, Portulaca oleracea, Alopecurus aequalis, Capsella bursa-pastoris, and Cerastium glomeratum. The fungus was isolated more frequently from warm-season weeds compared to cool-season ones (refer to Table 2).
The effect of glyphosate on conidial production by C. fructicola was evaluated using a benomyl-resistant isolate, Nara-gc5. Plants of A. blitum, D. ciliaris, S. oleraceus, and Asukaruby strawberry were inoculated under controlled conditions. Each plant received a treatment of 1 mL of glyphosate-potassium (5.0 g a.i./L, Roundup Maxload, Nissan Chemical Industries, Tokyo, Japan) two weeks post-inoculation, while control plants were treated with water. Leaves were collected seven days after glyphosate treatment, cut into 1 cm² pieces, and vortexed in sterilized distilled water for further analysis.
Plants were examined for anthracnose symptoms seven days following inoculation. A. blitum exhibited brown leaf spots caused by C. fructicola (illustrated in Fig. 1 and Table 3), which were distinct from the typical symptoms observed in strawberry plants. The pathogen was successfully reisolated from the symptomatic leaves, while no symptoms developed on other weed species.
Table 2 presents the detection frequency of Colletotrichum fructicola from common weed species, detailing the specific weed types, their growing months, and the percentage of isolation along with the number of leaves sampled. For example, Amaranthus blitum was isolated with a percentage of 17.9% from 56 sampled leaves, while Galinsoga ciliata and Solidago altissima each showed an 8.1% isolation rate from 37 and 74 leaves, respectively. In contrast, certain cool-season weeds like Cyperus microiria and Senecio vulgaris did not yield any isolates, indicating a variance in susceptibility among the different species and seasons.
Overall, A. blitum and strawberries maintained a high infection level throughout the experiment, ranging from 80% to 100%, while the infection rate of D. ciliaris decreased over time to approximately 20% within eight weeks. Although strawberries exhibited slight black leaf spots, the weeds remained symptom-free.
The influence of glyphosate treatment resulted in the death of all plants within seven days. The number of C. fructicola conidia was significantly higher on glyphosate-treated leaves compared to untreated leaves across all tested plants. Acervuli formation was microscopically observed on glyphosate-treated leaves seven days post-treatment. Anthracnose caused by C. fructicola is identified as one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberries in Nara, Japan.
The present study demonstrated that at least six out of 13 species of weeds were infected by Colletotrichum fructicola. Among these six weeds, five were warm-season species. Amaranthus blitum, one of the most common warm-season weeds in Nara, was frequently infected by C. fructicola, often developing leaf spots. The other five weeds exhibited less frequent infections and showed no visible symptoms. Colletotrichum fructicola is active under warm conditions; thus, warm-season weeds may present a high potential for pathogen activity. Of the warm-season weeds, A. blitum was considered the most likely to harbor the inoculum of C. fructicola in Nara Prefecture.
Inoculation tests with C. fructicola suggested that the pathogen can survive latently on most weeds. Colletotrichum acutatum, another anthracnose pathogen affecting strawberries, invades the intercellular spaces of infected plant tissues. The fungus produces secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves, increasing the conidial count three-fold. Similarly, C. fructicola may produce additional conidia during latent infections in weeds. The pathogen's increase in strawberry fields can go unnoticed, as latently infected weeds are often difficult to detect visually. Strawberry growers have not observed symptoms on control plants sprayed with sterile water.
The table outlines the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola on various weed species, including Amaranthus blitum, Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Sonchus oleraceus, Portulaca oleracea, and Fragaria × ananassa. It categorizes the type of symptoms observed: A. blitum exhibited brown leaf spots, while D. ciliaris and G. ciliata showed black leaf spots or lesions on leaflets and petioles. The findings indicate varying susceptibility among these species, which may influence the spread of C. fructicola.
The results indicated that weeds infected by C. fructicola can be categorized into three groups based on their susceptibility. The first group, including A. blitum, is consistently susceptible to the pathogen. The second group, such as D. ciliaris, shows a rapid decrease in susceptibility and does not develop symptoms. The third group, including Cyperus microiria, is resistant or immune to C. fructicola and does not appear to be sources of inoculum. Members of the second group can serve as inoculum sources under herbicide-treated conditions, as they produce abundant conidia after herbicide application, despite varying susceptibility among the weed species.

The conidia were dispersed more than 3 meters when it rained heavily, leading to the development of the disease on leaflets and petioles. Nonsymptomatic weeds have been recognized as significant inoculum sources. These latently infected weeds should thus be emphasized as important sources of inoculum for Colletotrichum fructicola. Consequently, the conidia that formed abundantly on herbicide-treated weeds are likely to be dispersed to strawberry plants, resulting in epidemics of strawberry anthracnose throughout the nursery.
In the traditional system of strawberry production, plants are grown in the ground, and crop rotation is essential. However, in recent cultivation systems, plants are continuously cultivated on elevated benches to improve production efficiency. This continuous cropping system usually increases weed populations and necessitates intensive herbicide applications, which can also enhance the risk of disease dissemination from weeds to strawberries. The present study demonstrated that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during the following cultivation season. While there are numerous sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, the increase of pathogens on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.
In conclusion, this study highlighted the potential importance of weeds as inoculum sources for C. fructicola and clarified the risks associated with herbicide treatment on weeds and inoculum production. Eliminating the pathogen from infected mother plants and removing plant residues are critical measures for controlling strawberry anthracnose. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that effective weed control through appropriate procedures is crucial to minimize the primary infection of strawberry plants by C. fructicola. This new information should assist farmers in determining the best cultivation methods to manage strawberry anthracnose.
