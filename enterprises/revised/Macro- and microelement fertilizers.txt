Abstract: This study evaluates how host nutritional variables affect the severity of crown and root rot in tomatoes caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici. Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4·H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2·4H2O) and CuSO4·5H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg·L–1 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg·L–1 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4·7H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.
Fungal agents, such as Trichoderma harzianum and nonpathogenic Fusarium oxysporum and Fusarium solani, along with bacterial agents like Bacillus subtilis and Pseudomonas species, typically provide only moderate levels of disease suppression in greenhouse and field conditions (Bochow et al., 1996; Duffy and Défago, 1997; Hartman and Fletcher, 1991; Louter and Edgington, 1990; M’Piga et al., 1997; Sivan et al., 1987). We thank Barbara Pärli and Ingeborg Kump for their technical assistance, as well as Jacques Fuchs and Marcello Zala for their valuable advice in developing the disease assay. Additionally, we appreciate comments from Emmannuel Frossard of ETH Zürich and David Weller from USDA–ARS Pullman, Washington.

Allelopathy from lettuce (Lactuca sativa L.) and dandelion (Taraxacum Weber sect. ruderalia sp. Kirschner) residues incorporated into the soil provides limited control of diseases (Jarvis, 1992; Jarvis and Thorpe, 1981), but this method is technically impractical in hydroponic production systems. Therefore, alternative control measures are needed, ideally aimed at developing an integrated disease management strategy.
The nutritional status of a plant significantly impacts its disease susceptibility, a factor that has been exploited for suppressing various diseases (Engelhard, 1989). Notable examples include Fusarium wilts caused by Fusarium oxysporum formae specialis, with reports dating back to the 1920s describing the beneficial effects of lime amendments (Jones et al., 1989). Since then, the impact of most major and minor nutrients on wilt diseases has been extensively studied. Jones and colleagues developed an effective fertilizer-based management strategy for Fusarium wilt of tomato, which is now used in commercial production systems in the United States. Similar approaches have been successful in controlling Fusarium wilts in other vegetable and ornamental crops (Elmer, 1992; Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985).
In contrast, little is currently known about how plant nutrition influences crown and root rot of tomato. Previous studies have only tested single concentrations of nitrogenous fertilizers and sodium chloride (Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980; Woltz et al., 1992), without examining the potential influence of other critical mineral nutrients, particularly microelements. The objective of our study was to compare the effects of several macro- and microelements (including various ammonium-N sources, nitrate-N, sodium phosphate, iron, molybdenum, and copper-, magnesium-, manganese-, and zinc-sulfates) on disease severity and the growth of tomato seedlings. Mineral nutrients were tested across a range of concentrations to provide more information for developing a fertilizer-based management strategy and for integrating mineral fertilizers with other control approaches (e.g., biocontrol) that may be sensitive to mineral levels.
The influence of various mineral nutrients on Fusarium crown and root rot was evaluated in a non-circulating hydroponics system. Pregerminated tomato seeds (cv. Bonnie Best), which were 2-3 days old and had sprouted primary roots measuring 2-4 mm in length on 0.85% water agar at 24 °C, were planted in rockwool cubes (3.5 cm in diameter and 4 cm deep; one seed per cube; Grodania A/S, Hedehusene, Denmark) placed in square plastic trays (5.5 cm deep). The rockwool was saturated with 800 mL of a dilute (1/4 strength) Knop nutrient solution containing the following concentrations (in mg·L–1): calcium nitrate (Ca(NO₃)₂·4H₂O) at 250; potassium phosphate (KH₂PO₄), potassium chloride (KCl), and magnesium sulfate (MgSO₄·7H₂O) at 62.52 each; and F2 e-EDDHA (ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid)).
Copper(II) sulfate pentahydrate (CuSO₄·5H₂O), magnesium sulfate heptahydrate (MgSO₄·7H₂O), manganese(II) sulfite (MnSO₃), molybdenum(IV) oxide (MoO₂), sodium dihydrogen phosphate monohydrate (NaH₂PO₄·H₂O), ammonium chloride (NH₄Cl), hexamolybdate ammonium ((NH₄)₆Mo₄O₂₄·4H₂O), ammonium nitrate (NH₄NO₃), diammonium sulfate ((NH₄)₂SO₄), and zinc sulfate heptahydrate (ZnSO₄·7H₂O) were added to the nutrient solution just before use to achieve a range of final concentrations (see Figs. 1–5). The pH was measured with a digital meter (Auer Bittmann Soulié AG, Zürich, Switzerland).
Before saturating the rock wool, the nutrient solution was inoculated with Fusarium oxysporum to achieve approximately 10⁵ microconidia plus mycelial fragments per mL, as previously described by Duffy and Défago (1997). Mycelial fragments were included because preliminary experiments showed that inoculation with microconidia alone resulted in little or no disease. The inoculum was produced by growing the pathogen in 150 mL of 2% malt extract broth (pH 5.5; Oxoid) in 500-mL baffled Erlenmeyer flasks at 24 °C for 5–7 days with shaking at 130 rpm. Cultures were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 2200 g to collect the fungal biomass, which was then briefly homogenized in an electric blender immediately before being added to the nutrient solution.
Plants were grown in a growth chamber in the greenhouse under a 16-hour light/8-hour darkness regime at 22 °C during the day and 18 °C at night, with 70% relative humidity. Lower temperatures are favorable for the development of crown and root rot, in contrast to warmer temperatures (approximately 28 °C), which favor Fusarium wilt (Jones et al., 1991). Millipore-filtered bi-distilled water (0.05 mm, Elgastat Ultra High Polishing unit, O. Kleiner AG, Wohlen, Switzerland) was added as needed to maintain a solution level of 1 to 2 cm. Fourteen days after planting, tomato seedlings were carefully removed from the rock wool with the upper 1.5 cm of the root system intact. They were weighed, and disease severity was rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (adapted from Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990), where 0 = symptomless; 1 = slight brown discoloration of the upper root system; 2 = moderate brown discoloration affecting two-thirds or less of the upper root system; 3 = extreme brown discoloration of the upper root system with numerous necrotic lesions extending up the crown and stem; and 4 = seedling dead or nearly dead. Representative samples of necrotic tissue were plated onto Komada’s selective medium (Komada, 1975) to confirm F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici as the cause of the symptoms.

Results and Discussion: A disease rating of 1–2 on a scale of 4 developed, characterized by necrotic lesions forming at the crown, generally observed in all control treatments within a week of emergence. This was often followed by severe chlorosis and turgor loss.
Twelve mineral nutrients were tested separately for their influence on Fusarium crown and root rot, alongside a standard nutrient solution (without additional minerals) (Figs. 1–4). The disease progressed rapidly in affected seedlings, leading to significant development of the disease (mean rating of 3–4) in treatments supplemented with ammonium-N (Fig. 1), phosphate (Fig. 3), iron, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum (Fig. 4). At higher concentrations tested, infected seedlings often failed to emerge. Seedlings that showed no symptoms after 10 days typically remained healthy, even when left to mature (data not shown), likely due to the poor spread of the pathogen in rockwool (Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990). In all treatments, the fresh weight of seedlings was inversely correlated with the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot (Figs. 1–5), which supports previous observations regarding this disease (Duffy and Défago, 1997; Jones et al., 1991; Woltz et al., 1992). Windborne and insect-transmitted spores were not factors in this study, as non-inoculated plants placed in the greenhouse (not included in the experiments) remained disease-free.
The form of nitrogen significantly influenced both the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and the growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg·L–1 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg·L–1 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N–20P–20K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg·L–1).

The bulk media was measured, and possible localized pH effects in the rhizosphere, where disease actually occurs, cannot be excluded (Smiley, 1975). Another possible factor may be total calcium concentrations, which are increased with liming and with calcium nitrates as used in our study and that of Woltz et al. (1992). They found that all treatments that increased calcium content also reduced disease. While adequate calcium in tomato tissues appears to be important for resistance to cell-wall-degrading enzymes (e.g., polygalacturonase) produced by Fusarium sp., it is generally considered a minor factor in controlling disease (Jones et al., 1989).
Sodium phosphate increased disease severity and reduced tomato growth (Fig. 3). Similar results with various phosphorus forms have been reported for wilt diseases caused by related formae speciali (Jones et al., 1989), which has been attributed in part to the enhanced uptake of calcium (Jarvis, 1992). While possible effects of sodium cannot be excluded, exhaustive studies with other Fusarium diseases (i.e., celery yellows (Schneider, 1985) and asparagus wilt (Elmer, 1992, 1995)) revealed no influence of the Na⁺ ion. Magnesium sulfate fertilization had absolutely no effect on Fusarium crown and root rot at concentrations up to 250 mg·L⁻¹ Mg (Fig. 3). To our knowledge, this is the first examination of magnesium on F. oxysporum independent of the Cl⁻ ion. Previous work has demonstrated that fertilization with MgCl₂ increased wilt caused by F. oxysporum formae speciali on tomato (Jones et al., 1989) and celery (Schneider, 1985). In these studies, Cl⁻ and not Mg²⁺ was suspected to be the problematic ion, a conclusion that is further supported by our results.
Mineral nutrient concentrations are uncommon in agricultural soils and hydroponics, but their availability can increase under certain conditions, such as acidification. Incidentally, acidic pH also favors crown and root rot (Woltz et al., 1992). Inert materials like rockwool tend to reduce plant sensitivity to minerals (Jarvis, 1992). Plants may also be exposed to elevated mineral concentrations applied to enhance the beneficial activity of biological control strains of Pseudomonas fluorescens (Duffy and Défago, 1997). Our study's results facilitate the development of microbe-mineral fertilizer treatments with minimal adverse side effects on the host plant, an area where information has been lacking. This highlights the need to develop methods for more efficient delivery of potentially phytotoxic minerals.
The exact way mineral nutrients influence disease is uncertain, but effects on pathogen activity and host susceptibility are likely involved. Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and Défago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and Défago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and Défago, 1997).
Our results build on those of Woltz et al. (1992) and provide a foundation for developing a control strategy based on plant nutrition. Such an approach has been successfully applied to manage other Fusarium diseases (Jarvis, 1992; Jones et al., 1989). The effects of mineral nutrients on crown and root rot of tomatoes caused by F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycospersici were similar to those reported for other formae speciales, reflecting the adaptability of control strategies for various Fusarium diseases. This further suggests a biological similarity of these pathogens and/or similar responses of diverse hosts to these fungi. However, fusarium crown and root rot is not the only issue threatening hydroponically grown tomatoes, and nontarget effects of certain mineral nutrients on other diseases must be considered. A prominent example is nitrate-N, which reduces crown and root rot but increases the severity of economically devastating diseases caused by Pythium and phytopathogenic bacteria (Stanghellini and Rasmussen, 1994). Integrating mineral nutrients with newly developed resistant cultivars, biocontrol agents, and/or fungicides used at reduced, non-phytotoxic concentrations may enhance the level and spectrum of disease control.
The influence of nitrogen nutrition on the sensitivity of tomato plants to culture filtrates of Fusarium and to fusaric acid is discussed in "Physiology and Plant Pathology," volume 23, pages 257–263. Bochow et al. (1996) detail modes of action in biocontrolling fungal seedling and root rot diseases by Bacillus subtilis in the proceedings of the IOBC WPRS Bulletin, volume 19, pages 99–108. Duffy and Défago (1997) highlight that zinc amendment improves biocontrol of tomato crown and root rot by Pseudomonas fluorescens and represses the production of pathogen metabolites that inhibit bacterial antibiotic biosynthesis (Phytopathology 87:1250–1257).
Egli (1969) investigated the influence of heavy metals on Fusarium lycopersici and the disease progression of tomato wilt (J. Phytopathol. 66:223–252). Elmer (1992) found that sodium chloride suppresses Fusarium crown and root rot of asparagus (Phytopathology 82:97–104), while Elmer (1995) discussed the association of manganese-reducing bacteria and sodium chloride in the suppression of the same disease (Phytopathology 85:1461–1467). Engelhard (1989) edited a comprehensive work on managing soilborne plant pathogens with macro- and microelements (APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.).
Erb and Rowe (1992) screened tomato seedlings for multiple disease resistance (J. Amer. Soc. Hort. Sci. 117:622–627). Gillespie and Menzies (1993) noted that fungus gnats vector Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (Ann. Appl. Biol. 123:539–544). Hartman and Fletcher (1991) reviewed Fusarium crown and root rot of tomatoes in the UK.
Heremans (1996) developed a rapid method for screening tomato plant resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (Med. Fac. Landb. Toeg. Biol. Wetensch. Univ. Gent 61(2A):337–341). Huber and Watson (1974) examined nitrogen form and plant disease (Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 12:139–165). Jarvis (1988, 1992) contributed significantly to managing diseases in greenhouse crops (Phytoprotection 69:49–64; APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.). Jarvis and Thorpe (1980, 1981) studied the effects of nitrate and ammonia nitrate on Fusarium severity and soil amendment with lettuce residues for disease control (Plant Dis. 64:309–310; Can. J. Plant Pathol. 3:159–162).
Jones et al. (1989) discussed managing Fusarium wilt of vegetables and ornamentals by using macro- and microelements (APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.). Komada (1975) developed a selective medium for the quantitative isolation of Fusarium oxysporum from natural soils (Rev. Plant Prot. Res. 8:114–125). Littell et al. (1991) provided insights into the SAS system for linear models (SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.).
Louter and Edgington (1990) found indications of cross-protection against Fusarium crown and root rot of tomato (Can. J. Plant Pathol. 12:283–288). Mandal and Sinha (1992) proposed an alternative chemical control approach for Fusarium wilt of tomato (Indian Phytopathol. 45:194–198). Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) studied Fusarium crown and root rot in greenhouse rock wool systems and disease management with benomyl (Plant Dis. 74:996–1002). M’Piga et al. (1997) reported increased resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici.
