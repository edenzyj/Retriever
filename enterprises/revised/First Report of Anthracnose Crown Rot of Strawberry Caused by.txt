In Taiwan, strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) is a high-value crop, cultivated over an average area of approximately 500 hectares annually in the past five years. The majority of strawberry cultivation (over 90%) is concentrated in Miaoli County, with the cultivar 'Taoyuan No. 1' as the predominant variety, having been widely used for more than 30 years. In recent years, anthracnose has emerged as a particularly destructive disease affecting strawberry crops.
Historically, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum have been cited as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan (Plant Protection Information System; https://otserv2.tactri.gov.tw/ppm/). However, detailed information regarding isolation, pathogenicity, and morphological or molecular identification of the pathogen has been lacking.
From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.
To isolate the causal agent, fragments (approximately 0.2 × 0.2 cm) of diseased crown tissue were surface-disinfested with 1% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed three times in sterile water, and then placed on 1.5% water agar. After 2 to 3 days, single hyphal tips were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated for 7 days at 25°C under a 12-hour light/dark photoperiod. The colonies initially appeared white, becoming zonate and velvety, with a light gray upper surface and a gray reverse. They developed concentric rings of salmon-colored sporodochia. Conidia were measured at 9.68 to 17.95 × 3.88 to 5.84 µm (average 14.53 ± 0.31 × 4.99 ± 0.08 µm, n = 90), hyaline, oblong to cylindrical, with rounded obtuse ends.
Morphologically, the causal agent closely resembled species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, as per the classification by Weir et al. (2012). For molecular confirmation of the species, genomic DNA was extracted from 10 isolates using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taipei). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), β-tubulin 2 (TUB2), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified by PCR.
Sequences were submitted to GenBank with the following accession numbers: MK174223 (ITS), MK174224 (CHS-1), MK174225 (ACT), MK174226 (TUB2), MK174227 (CAL), and MK174228 (ApMAT). The ITS, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT sequences were compared to the GenBank nr database, specifically restricted to type material. Results indicated 98% to 99% identity to C. siamense (syn. C. dianesei and C. melanocaulon) (Liu et al. 2016; Prihastuti et al. 2009), which is part of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. The corresponding sequences were as follows: ITS (NR_144800), CHS-1 (KX094094), ApMAT (KX094304; Lima et al. 2013), ACT (KX093987), TUB2 (KX094290), and CAL (KX094036; Doyle et al. 2013). Koch's postulates were fulfilled for two isolates (ML133 and ML612) by spraying a suspension of 1×10^6 conidia/mL on seedlings until runoff at the 4 to 5 leaf stage (two trials per isolate, n = 5 seedlings per trial). Inoculated plants were covered with plastic bags (maintaining > 90% relative humidity) for 24 hours at 30°C, then kept in a growth chamber at 30°C with 70% humidity under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark photoperiod. After 7 days, all inoculated plants exhibited typical necrotic leaf spots and wilt symptoms similar to those observed in the field. Control plants sprayed with sterile water showed no symptoms (n = 5 per trial). Longitudinal sections of the inoculated crowns revealed reddish-brown and white-marbled necrosis. Fungi were re-isolated from lesions on diseased leaves or crowns with 100% frequency (n ≥ 3 isolates per trial), and their morphological characteristics and gene sequences were identical to those of the original isolates. To our knowledge, this is the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose crown rot (ACR) in strawberry in Taiwan. The disease poses a significant risk of serious losses to the strawberry industry in Taiwan, highlighting the need for research on management strategies to minimize these losses.

Supplementary Figure S1 provides a visual representation of anthracnose symptoms on strawberry plants, depicting various stages and characteristics of infection. Panel (a) shows a strawberry plant affected by anthracnose crown rot, exhibiting chlorotic to blighted leaves and wilting. Panel (b) presents a longitudinal section of an infected crown, revealing marbled reddish-brown necrosis. Panel (c) illustrates black necrotic leaf spots, while panel (d) highlights withering and girdling on a runner. Panel (e) displays the fungal colony's initial white coloration, which later becomes light gray on the upper side. Finally, panel (f) shows conidia that are hyaline, oblong to cylindrical, with rounded obtuse ends, with a scale bar indicating a size of 10 μm.
