Abstract: Three Colletotrichum species—Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (teleomorph Glomerella acutata J.C. Guerber & J.C. Correll), Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. [teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk]—are major pathogens of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa). Strawberry anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease in commercial strawberry fields in the southeastern United States since the 1930s. The causal fungus, C. fragariae, can infect all aboveground plant parts; however, the disease is most severe when it infects the crown, leading to crown rot, wilt, and death.
C. gloeosporioides was responsible for an epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry nurseries in Arkansas and North Carolina in the late 1970s. The anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberry in the United States in 1986. Since the 1980s, increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots may be linked to changes in cultivars and the widespread adoption of annual plasticulture production over traditional matted-row systems.
Investigations into anthracnose in the United States have focused on its epidemiology and the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species regarding their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics, infection processes, and pathogenicity. Findings from these studies have enhanced our understanding of the diseases and improved disease control strategies. Strawberries grown in high-nitrogen soils are more susceptible to anthracnose than those grown in lower nitrogen conditions or those amended with calcium nitrate. The disease spreads more rapidly in fields with overhead irrigation and plastic mulch compared to those using drip irrigation and straw mulch.
Fungicide efficacy has been evaluated through in vitro, greenhouse, and field studies, with some pathogens showing resistance to specific fungicides. Developing anthracnose-resistant cultivars remains a primary objective for most strawberry breeding programs in the southern United States.
Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops worldwide, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides being responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant issue in strawberry nurseries and fruit production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986). The increase in anthracnose-related losses since the 1980s is likely due to the shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture systems and changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are gaining importance, leading to major economic losses for strawberry growers globally. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.

Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum are known to cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was initially assumed to be the causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the United States. This fungus had previously been documented as causing anthracnose fruit rot of strawberries in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it had likely existed in the United States for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides causes anthracnose crown rot, petiole lesions, and leaf spots that are indistinguishable from those caused by C. fragariae. In a series of comparative studies examining these three major causal agents of strawberry anthracnose, Smith and Black analyzed the cultural characteristics, conidia, appressoria, and setae of 24 Colletotrichum isolates. Colletotrichum fragariae isolates developed colonies that ranged in color from beige to olive to dark gray, did not form the ascigerous state in culture, and produced conidia that were typically cylindrical, sharply tapered at one end and rounded at the other. In contrast, C. gloeosporioides isolates were very similar but did form the Glomerella cingulata ascigerous state in culture, with conidia that were usually rounded at both ends. Both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides isolates produced dark black setae that were visible with a hand lens in acervuli, both in culture and on petiole, stolon, and fruit lesions.
Colletotrichum acutatum isolates produced fusiform conidia that were tapered at both ends, developed colonies in colors including white, pink, orange, rose, or beige, and did not produce setae or the ascigerous state in culture. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture was slower than that of the other two species at all tested temperatures, with the greatest difference observed at 32°C. C. fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States and was responsible for crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern United States.
C. fragariae generally causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms compared to C. acutatum, and is considered by some to be a host-specific or conspecific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992). In the late 1970s, C. gloeosporioides was identified as the causal agent on plants obtained from Arkansas and North Carolina nurseries that exhibited crown rot similar to that caused by C. fragariae (Howard et al., 1992). This species has a wide host and geographic range, causing diseases in many plant hosts worldwide.
The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.
Results from several studies suggest that Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. In one such study (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Analyses based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence for two subgroups within C. acutatum.
The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberries and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. The larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and exhibited variable RAPD patterns along with divergent ITS2 sequence analysis. Based on these molecular data, Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberries. Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).
Anthracnose crown rot (Smith, 1998a), caused by either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides, is first noticeable by the wilting of the youngest leaves during the hottest part of the day. The young wilted leaves may appear to recover and become turgid in the evenings; however, most will wilt and die after a few days. Shortly after the plants wilt, a red discoloration appears within the crown tissue, from which the causal pathogen may be isolated. After the plants have been dead for several days, the crown tissue turns dark brown to black, making Colletotrichum species difficult to isolate.
While Colletotrichum acutatum can also cause crown death, it typically infects only a single side crown rather than the entire crown. Infected plants may be stunted but do not necessarily die. All three Colletotrichum species can cause dark brown or black sunken lesions on petioles and stolons, which often girdle these structures, with pink masses of conidia usually visible near the center of each lesion. Additionally, all three species can cause leaf spots (Howard et al., 1992; Maas and Palm, 1997; Smith, 1998c).
Black leaf spot, typically caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides, is characterized by gray or light black spots that are usually not necrotic, peppered across the top surface of the strawberry leaflets. In contrast, C. acutatum more typically causes irregular leaf spots, which primarily feature necrotic black lesions at the tips of the leaflets. All three Colletotrichum species also cause flower blights and fruit rots (Smith, 1998b). Fully open flowers are much more susceptible than closed buds (Smith, 1993). Infected green fruit often become hard and brown, mummifying rather than ripening. Anthracnose lesions on ripe fruit are firm, slightly sunken, and covered with pink spore masses. Additionally, Colletotrichum acutatum causes root lesions.
The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field. This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2-3 days at 25°C to 6-17 days at 5°C (King et al., 1997). At 5°C and 10°C, the latent period for C. acutatum was shorter than that for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species were similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may significantly contribute to inoculum sources for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may help maintain inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness durations than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves exposed to flower extracts than those exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), indicating that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may rise during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally decreased with increased plant density, concluding that higher density reduces rain penetration into the canopy and thus splash dispersal. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied splash dispersal of conidia from three Colletotrichum spp. and discovered that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while C. acutatum conidia traveled the farthest, likely due to a higher spore production on infected fruit. Colletotrichum acutatum conidia can survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but both conidia and sclerotia die quickly in moist conditions when soil moisture exceeds 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).
As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.
Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986).
Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate. Anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of calcium chloride developed less fruit rot than that from plants receiving soil applications of calcium chloride (Smith and Gupton, 1993).
The primary means to reduce the buildup of anthracnose fruit rot in the field is to harvest fruit frequently and remove all rotten fruit from the field. Following severe infections early in the fruiting season, all infected fruit should be stripped from the plants and removed from the field. Infected areas of a field should be harvested last in the day, or workers should wash up and change into clean clothes when they must enter uninfected areas of the field after harvesting areas where fruit rot is present.
Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.
In-vitro trials have been used to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose (LaMondia, 1993; McInnes et al., 1992b; Smith and Black, 1992). Smith and Black (1993) reported that all 16 C. acutatum, 14 out of 18 C. fragariae, and both C. gloeosporioides isolates tested in vitro were resistant to benomyl, and all benomyl-resistant isolates were also resistant to carbendazim, which is in the same class of fungicides as benomyl. In a greenhouse study, plants treated with propiconazole had lower disease severity ratings than did plants treated with captafol or benomyl (Smith and Black, 1991). However, the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter with dark green leaves that appeared thicker than the leaves of untreated plants.
In the early 1980s, anthracnose became a significant disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States. In response, the USDA-ARS established a breeding program to develop anthracnose-resistant cultivars suited to the strawberry-growing regions of this area. This initiative was conducted at the Small Fruit Research Station in Poplarville, MS, and the Fruit Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, in collaboration with state experiment stations in Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina (Galletta et al., 1997; Smith and Spiers, 1982).
From 1976 to 1995, over 160,000 progeny from 448 crosses made at Beltsville, primarily by G.J. Galletta, were screened for anthracnose resistance in a greenhouse at Poplarville, MS. Initially, the parent lines consisted of eastern cultivars and advanced selections from the breeding program at Beltsville. As the program progressed, resistant selections from the anthracnose program were crossed with commercial cultivars to enhance the horticultural characteristics of the progeny.
Seeds from the crosses made at Beltsville were germinated at Poplarville. The resultant seedlings were inoculated with a conidial suspension of Colletotrichum fragariae, incubated in a dew chamber for 48 hours, then moved to a warm greenhouse and evaluated for anthracnose severity 30 days after inoculation. Resistant seedlings were further assessed in the field in Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, and North Carolina, with selections made based on yield, fruit quality, plant habit, and resistance to leaf scorch (caused by Diplocarpon earlianum), leaf spot (caused by Mycosphaerella fragariae), powdery mildew (caused by Sphaerotheca macularis), and two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae).
A total of 1,515 anthracnose-resistant selections were identified from the seedlings tested in Mississippi. Four of these resistant strawberry clones were released as breeding lines (Galletta et al., 1993) and have since been utilized as sources of anthracnose resistance in several breeding programs. Additionally, Smith et al. (1998) released the cultivar Pelican, which demonstrates high resistance to both anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum. Pelican is also resistant to varieties of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae.
Ongoing evaluation of strawberry seedlings and advanced breeding lines from state and private breeding programs continues. The USDA's anthracnose-resistance screening procedure has effectively identified resistant genotypes in seedling progenies from the North Carolina State University breeding program, with over 32,000 resistant strawberry seedlings identified between 1998 and 1999 (Ballington et al., 2002).
Smith and Black (1987) discovered that resistance to C. fragariae was influenced by environmental conditions post-inoculation. Plants incubated at a high temperature (35°C) for 48 hours in a dew chamber (with relative humidity near 100%) exhibited higher disease severity ratings compared to those incubated at 25 or 30°C. Additionally, plants maintained in a greenhouse at 32°C after dew chamber incubation displayed more severe symptoms than those kept at 25°C. Notably, two- to four-week-old strawberry seedlings (measured after transplanting at the first true-leaf stage) were more susceptible to C. fragariae than 14- to 18-week-old seedlings when inoculated with a conidial suspension (Smith et al., 1990).
Another strategy being pursued is tissue culture-induced (somaclonal) variation.
Gupton and Smith (1991) determined that the estimates of dominance genetic variance were six to ten times higher than those for additive genetic variance. The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was bimodal, suggesting major gene action. Narrow-sense heritability estimates of 0.37 and 0.26 were likely sufficient to produce gains from recurrent selection, while gains from selection of clonal value should be possible due to the high broad-sense heritability estimates of 0.87 and 0.85. Giménez and Ballington (2002) also found that nonadditive effects were more important than additive effects in the inheritance of resistance in runners. The epistatic nature of anthracnose resistance in runners is supported by results from crosses between susceptible parents, which resulted in up to 20% resistant seedlings (Ballington et al., 2002). Giménez and Ballington (2002) indicated that the frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies suggests that resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum in runners is quantitative. Results from Garcés et al. (2002) also support the theory that the inheritance of resistance to anthracnose is quantitative in nature.
Increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots may be related to the shift from matted-row culture to the annual plasticulture production system in the United States. Breeding for genetic resistance to anthracnose and the development of resistant cultivars are primary means for reducing economic losses due to this disease. This approach is environmentally sound as it leads to reduced use of fungicides.
As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses from both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also diminished economic losses due to these diseases. Nevertheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental factors are highly favorable for anthracnose development.
