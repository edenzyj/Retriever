Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.
This Perspective article presents a review of the current knowledge on C. acutatum phylogeny, biology, and pathology. It also demonstrates the suitability of C. acutatum for the study of gene family evolution on a fine scale to uncover evolutionary events in the genome associated with the evolution of phenotypic characters important for host interactions.
Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).
Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Diéguez-Uribeondo, 2004; O’Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).
Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a “popular” entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991–2010 containing “Colletotrichum” in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).
FIGURE 1: Phylogenetic analysis of the 42 strains of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex listed in Supplementary Table S1 is based on a multilocus concatenated alignment of the ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3, ACT, and TUB2 genes. Accepted species (Jayawardena et al., 2016) are highlighted in black, while isolates that do not fit those criteria are reported in gray. Colletotrichum orchidophilum was used as an outgroup.
Sporulation has been studied in various species (Talhinhas et al., 2011). Colletotrichum nymphaeae is an entomopathogen that infects the citrus orthezia scale insect, Praelongorthezia praelonga (Mascarin et al., 2016), while C. fioriniae is pathogenic toward the insect Fiorinia externa (Marcelino et al., 2008).
On certain fruits, such as apple and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), members of the C. acutatum species complex cause both pre-harvest and post-harvest diseases (Milholland, 1995; Jones et al., 1996; Shi et al., 1996). On these plants, asymptomatic, quiescent infections occur on unripe fruit, developing into necrotic lesions as the fruit ripens (Alkan et al., 2015). There are many other examples of post-harvest decay in fruits like peaches (Prunus persica), almonds (Prunus dulcis), avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), papaya (Carica papaya), and guava (Psidium guajava) that stem from quiescent infections that began in the field (Agostini et al., 1992; Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Smith, 1998; Afanador-Kafuri et al., 2003).
Sexual reproduction has been identified in some Colletotrichum species, but for most, only the anamorph is known (Carvajal and Edgerton, 1944; Politis, 1975; Guerber and Correll, 2001). In vitro analyses have shown that some C. acutatum species are heterothallic, requiring two strains of opposite mating types to complete the sexual cycle (Guerber and Correll, 2001), while others are homothallic, capable of sexual reproduction without a second strain (Talgø et al., 2007; LoBuglio and Pfister, 2008; Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012). Phylogenetic analyses suggest a strong relationship between monophyletic lineages and mating behavior (Baroncelli, 2012). In this case, there is a hypothetical homothallic ancestor and two lineage-specific events: the first being the acquisition of heterothallic capability in specific lineages and the second being the complete loss of mating behavior in others. Thus, C. acutatum s.l. is a suitable system for studying the genetic bases of fungal mating systems and the effects of sexual behavior on genome architecture, ecological adaptation, and host association patterns.
The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.
In recent years, genome sequences for 28 species of Colletotrichum have been published, and comparative genomic studies have concentrated on genes associated with pathogenicity (Gan et al., 2013), host specialization (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016), and transitions between biotrophic and necrotrophic lifestyles (O’Connell et al., 2012), as well as between endophytic and parasitic lifestyles (Hacquard et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016). Comparative analyses of secretomes have revealed that most predicted secreted proteins possess enzymatic activity, with many identified as candidate effectors (O’Connell et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016; Sanz-Martín et al., 2016). The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O’Connell et al., 2012).
Another significant finding from comparative studies is that lifestyle and host preference do not correlate with phylogenetic relationships (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). A comparison of the genomes of the endophyte C. tofieldiae and the closely related pathogen C. incanum indicated that the transition to an endophytic lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the number of predicted effectors and an expansion of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related proteins (Hacquard et al., 2016). In contrast, relatively distantly related members of the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes exhibit remarkably similar repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secreted proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). This observation suggests that these gene families evolved recently and independently in these two phylogenetically separated lineages (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). Further comparative analyses of the genomes within the C. acutatum species complex revealed that necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins were twice as abundant as in the other fungi studied. The large number of these genes underscores their potential significance in the pathogenicity of these species.
Phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities were generated using MrBayes 3.2.1 (Ronquist and Huelsenbeck, 2003) for the C. acutatum species complex based on a combined sequence alignment. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene, determined by MEGA7, were used for each locus. The analysis in MrBayes was run for 5,106 generations to achieve a P-value lower than 0.01, utilizing two parallel searches with heated and one cold Markov chain sampled every 100 generations, with 25% of the generations discarded as burn-in.
Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O’Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.

The virulence diversity of anthracnose pathogens, specifically Colletotrichum acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes, has been studied across eight olive cultivars commonly grown in Portugal. The work by Peres et al. (2005) highlighted the life cycles of C. acutatum, while Talhinhas et al. (2011) examined the epidemiology, histopathology, and aetiology of olive anthracnose caused by these pathogens. Perfect et al. (1999) identified Colletotrichum as a model genus for studies in pathology and fungal-plant interactions.
Prusky et al. (2013) discussed the quiescent and necrotrophic lifestyle choices of these fungi during postharvest disease development. They emphasized how these lifestyle choices influence disease outcomes. The distinct population structure of Colletotrichum species associated with olive anthracnose in the Algarve region reflects a complex host-pathogen relationship.
Further investigations by Queiroz et al. (2017) focused on molecular and phenotypic analyses that revealed associations of diverse Colletotrichum groups and a low level of C. gloeosporioides with olive anthracnose. In their work, they detailed the draft genome sequences of two isolates of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, the causal agent of anthracnose in common beans.
Redman et al. (2001) explored the evolution of fungal symbiosis, discussing the transition from mutualism to parasitism and questioning who controls the outcome of this relationship—host or invader? Vargas et al. (2012) provided insights into plant defense mechanisms activated during both biotrophic and necrotrophic stages of Colletotrichum graminicola development in maize.
Additionally, Wharton and Diéguez-Uribeondo (2004) discussed the biology of Colletotrichum acutatum, contributing to the understanding of its role in plant pathology. Lastly, Monod et al. (2016) highlighted the highly conserved nature of certain genes across various species, indicating their potential importance in pathogenicity.
