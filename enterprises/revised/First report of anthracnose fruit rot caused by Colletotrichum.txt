Anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) has been observed in greenhouses during the harvesting period in Chungnam Province, South Korea. Infected fruits show black or brown spots, orange conidial masses, and in some areas, white fungal growths are visible. The size of these spots gradually expands, leading to necrosis of the fruits and flowers. Three isolates obtained from infected fruits were identified as strains of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex based on morphological characteristics. Multilocus sequence analysis of actin, chitin synthase, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) rDNA regions revealed that the isolates belong to a monophyletic group with the type strain of C. nymphaeae. This is the first confirmation of C. nymphaeae on strawberry fruits in Korea.
Strawberries (Fragaria x ananassa) are a high-income crop in Korea. In 2022, they were ranked as the third-highest income crop among greenhouse vegetables, following cucumbers and eggplants, and fourth in terms of cultivation area among fruit and vegetable crops. In Chungnam Province, various strawberry varieties such as Seolhyang and Kingsberry are cultivated.

In November 2021, anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberries (cv. Kingsberry) in Nonsan, Chungnam Province. Early symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) include blackening of specific tissues of the strawberry. These symptoms progress with the enlargement of lesions, which hinder proper fruit development and lead to the formation of orange-colored spores within the lesions. Similar symptoms were noted on the petioles, with sunken and blackened tissues similar to those on the fruit, accompanied by the formation of an orange conidial mass.
Figure 1 illustrates the symptoms of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum nymphaeae on strawberry: (A) the initial symptom of anthracnose fruit rot on the surface of strawberry fruit; (B) exacerbated symptoms on the surface of strawberry fruit; (C) symptoms on the peduncle; and (D) symptoms resulting from an artificial inoculation test with an isolate.
In Korea, AFR caused by Colletotrichum acutatum (J. H. Simmonds) was first reported in 2008. However, the primary concern has been anthracnose crown rot (ACR), rather than AFR. ACR was initially attributed to C. gloeosporioides, but was later reclassified as resulting from C. fructicola based on molecular phylogenetic analyses.
Morphological characteristics, such as the size and shape of conidia, were examined using a compound microscope (Olympus BX46, Tokyo, Japan). Based on the morphological features reported previously, the isolates were identified as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex. All isolates initially formed white mycelia on potato dextrose agar (PDA), which later turned light brown starting from the center of the front side. The conidia were hyaline, single-celled, and cylindrical, with pointed ends. The size range of the conidia was 11.0–15.0 × 4.5–5.0 µm, while the appressoria were ovate or globose and brown in color, with a size range of 7.0–11.3 × 5.3–7.5 µm.
The cultural and morphological characteristics of Colletotrichum nymphaeae were observed as follows: The front and reverse colony morphologies of isolate CAN211201 grown on PDA after 7 days showed white mycelia that later turned light brown. The conidia were cylindrical, one-celled, and aseptate, with pointed ends. A comparison table (Table 1) highlighted the morphological characteristics of the strain used in this study compared to previous reports on C. nymphaeae. For C. nymphaeae (CAN211201), the colony morphology changed from white mycelia to light brown from the center, whereas in previous reports, pinkish-orange conidial masses turned gray. The conidia size for CAN211201 ranged from 11.0–15.0 × 4.5–5.0 µm, compared to the previous range of 10.6–15.9 × 4.0–5.8 µm.
For phylogenetic classification, genomic DNA was extracted from fungal isolates grown on PDA using a modified CTAB extraction protocol. The ITS, ACT, CHS-1, and GAPDH gene regions were amplified using established methods. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). Each sequence was assembled and proofread using MEGA v.7. The sequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank (PP839268-PP839270 for ITS, PP908669-PP908671 for ACT, PP908672-PP908674 for CHS-1, PP908675-PP908677 for GAPDH). Multiple alignments were conducted using MAFFT ver. 7. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were carried out using RAxML on the CIPRES web portal with the GTR+G model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that three isolates formed a monophyletic group with C. nymphaeae CBS 515.78 (ex-type), CBS 526.77, CBS 129936, and CBS 126366, with bootstrap support of 89%.
The isolate CAN211201 was utilized for artificial inoculation for pathogenicity testing. A suspension of 1 × 10^5 conidia/mL was sprayed onto each of the five fruits of the 'Kingsberry' cultivar, while five fruits treated with sterilized water served as controls. The inoculated fruits were kept in a moist box (100% relative humidity) at 25°C for 5 days. During the pathogenicity testing, the isolated strain exhibited typical symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot on the fruits, initially showing a black lesion. Due to the high humidity, the lesion was eventually covered with white fungal growth, while the controls remained symptom-free. The fungus was successfully re-isolated and identified as C. nymphaeae through morphological and phylogenetic analysis.
Previously, Colletotrichum acutatum, not Colletotrichum nymphaeae, was reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) in strawberries in Korea. However, C. nymphaeae has been documented in strawberry plants in Egypt and Argentina. Additionally, cases of anthracnose caused by C. nymphaeae in Korea have been observed in kiwiberries, Japanese plums, and persimmons. Given these findings, it is crucial to investigate whether C. nymphaeae originated from other plants or countries. This study confirms that C. nymphaeae induces AFR in strawberry fruits based on morphological features and molecular phylogenetic analyses.
First Report of Anthracnose Caused by Colletotrichum nymphaeae on Strawberry Fruits in Korea.
Therefore, continuous monitoring should be conducted to determine if C. nymphaeae causing AFR occurs in other strawberry cultivation regions.
