The strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers. However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.
A longitudinal cut through the crowns of diseased plants revealed characteristic red and white marbling, consistent with descriptions by Weir et al. (2012). Crowns from seven symptomatic strawberry plants were collected after excising foliage and roots, then washed under running water for one hour. The crowns were surface-disinfested with 70% ethanol followed by 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 and 3 minutes, respectively. Small pieces (2 mm × 2 mm) of the internally infected marbled red tissue were cut using a sterile scalpel and placed on Corn Meal Agar medium, incubating for 7 days at 25°C. Conidia grown from these tissue pieces and the hyphal mats were streaked on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) plates to isolate single conidial colonies. Two single-conidial isolates (BRSP08 and BRSP09), characterized by white margins and circular, dull orange centers, were selected to confirm Koch's postulates.
The average mycelial growth rate was 9.8 mm per day at 25°C on PDA, exhibiting cottony aerial growth and a pale yellowish to pinkish hue. The conidia were hyaline, cylindrical with rounded ends, measuring 14.90 - 18.19 µm × 4.05 - 6.20 µm (average ± SD: 16.22 ± 1.20 × 5.90 ± 0.84 µm, n = 30). Appressoria were brown, globose to cylindrical, lobed, and measured 7.50 - 12.70 µm.
The study focuses on the complex in the Rajshahi District of Bangladesh.

Appendix 1a describes anthracnose disease symptoms observed in two naturally infected strawberry plants (A, B, E, and F) of the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar. It also includes images of mycelial growth (C and G), conidia (D, H, and I), and appressoria (J) from isolates of Colletotrichum siamense grown in PDA medium. Specifically, images C and D correspond to the isolate BRSP08, while G, H, I, and J correspond to BRSP09.
Appendix 1b illustrates a healthy plant inoculated with a conidial suspension of the anthracnose pathogen, showcasing characteristic wilt symptoms. Image A shows a healthy plant before treatment with the conidial suspension from BRSP08, while B depicts a wilted plant post-inoculation with BRSP08. Images C and D follow the same pattern for isolate BRSP09, showing a healthy plant before treatment and a wilted plant after inoculation, respectively. Additionally, E and F display the mycelial growth of purified isolates recovered from the artificially inoculated plants (B and D) from BRSP08 and BRSP09.
Appendix 1c presents a neighbor-joining tree inferred from combined gene analyses of several genes (ITS, TUB2, CHS-1, ACT, CAL, and ApMat) using sequence alignment from the isolate BRSP09 and other Colletotrichum species in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, retrieved from GenBank. One clade containing the strawberry isolate is highlighted with a colored block. The numbers above the branches indicate bootstrap values, and the scale bar represents the expected number of substitutions per site.
Appendix 1d shows a maximum likelihood tree derived from the same gene analyses as Appendix 1c. It includes the same details regarding the clade containing the strawberry isolate, bootstrap values, and scale bar.
