Anthracnose is a significant disease affecting grape crops (Dowling et al., 2020). Beyond causing severe yield losses, anthracnose epidemics can diminish the quality of the produce (Waller et al., 2002; Dowling et al., 2020). The most economically damaging symptoms often include blossom blight and fruit rots; however, necrotic lesions may also develop on leaves, stems, and twigs, leading to plant deterioration and reduced fruit quality (Dowling et al., 2020).
Colletotrichum species are categorized into phylogenetic clades (also referred to as species complexes) based on multilocus molecular analysis. Species within a clade are closely related and share similar temperature requirements (Cannon et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2020; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021; Salotti et al., 2022). A recent systematic review identified 15 major clades of the genus, along with several smaller clusters and isolated species (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). Detailed descriptions of these major phylogenetic clades and the species within them have been provided by multiple studies (Cannon et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2020; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021; Damm et al., 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014; Weir et al., 2012).
Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32°C (Salotti et al., 2022).
Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for Colletotrichum spp. encompass cultural, biological, and chemical control measures. Cultural control practices include producing disease-free propagating materials, avoiding overhead irrigation, minimizing rain splashing through mulching, and managing weeds (Coelho et al., 2008; Saxena et al., 2016). It is also recommended to remove infected crop residues and any mummified or rotten fruits to reduce inoculum sources and disease spread.
Mathematical models can help growers schedule fungicide sprays (Pertot et al., 2017; Rossi et al., 2019; Fedele et al., 2022). Models have been developed to understand the epidemiology of anthracnose on specific crops and to support infection-risk-based fungicide applications (Dodd et al., 1991; Park et al., 1992; Monroe et al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh, 2020). However, most of these models are simple, considering only one component of the pathogen life cycle—primarily conidial infection—and focus on a single Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of these models have never been validated against independent data (i.e., data not used in model development). In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts. As a result, mechanistic models are considered useful for decision-making in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (De Wolf and Isard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al. (2021) developed and validated a mechanistic, weather-driven model for the ripe rot of grapes caused by Colletotrichum species.
Given that the pathogens causing different Colletotrichum diseases affecting the aerial parts of host plants in the field (pre-harvest) have similar life cycles, we developed a general, weather-driven, mechanistic model for anthracnose epidemics. The model is general in that it has one conceptual structure incorporating the key epidemiological components and a set of equations that account for the effects of external variables (both environmental and host-related). This model can be calibrated for single Colletotrichum species, clades, and host plants. For model development and calibration, we (i) conducted a systematic literature search to retrieve available information on Colletotrichum anthracnose diseases; (ii) used this information to develop a conceptual model of the diseases caused by Colletotrichum species based on systems analysis; (iii) developed mathematical equations describing the system both quantitatively and dynamically; (iv) calibrated the model for seven major clades and the singleton species C. coccodes (referred to as the coccodes clade in this report); and (v) evaluated the model's ability to represent the real system.
To develop the conceptual and mathematical structure of the model, we conducted a systematic literature search (Okoli and Schabram, 2010; Biesbroek et al., 2013; Candel, 2014) to collect data on the biology, ecology, and epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. from academic articles, press articles, and conference papers. The search utilized a combination of the following keywords: (i) Colletotrichum; (ii) conidia OR spore OR acervuli OR primary inoculum OR production OR development OR overwinter OR dissemination OR release OR dispersion OR deposition OR infection OR penetration OR germination OR incubation OR lesion development OR lesion onset OR latency OR latent period; and (iii) temperature OR wetness OR relative humidity OR rain OR environment.
The literature search was carried out in 2022 across three bibliographical databases: Scopus, Web of Science, and CAB Abstracts. Each article was initially reviewed based on the title and abstract; articles of potential interest were then read in full. Additional articles were retrieved from the References section of the found articles and were also reviewed.
Although different lifestyles have been described for Colletotrichum spp. (i.e., necrotrophic, biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, quiescent, and endophytic lifestyles), these species share some common attributes in their life cycles (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017), which include both sexual and asexual reproduction. The perithecial stage is rarely observed in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), making asexual conidia the most critical stage for disease development. Therefore, our model focuses on the asexual life cycle. A general asexual life cycle for Colletotrichum spp. is illustrated in Figure 1.
Colletotrichum spp. overwinter as mycelium or sclerotia in crop debris (Farley, 1976; Casela and Frederiksen, 1993; Yoshida et al., 2002; Conner et al., 2019), fruit mummies (Moral and Trapero, 2012; Samuelian et al., 2012; McKay et al., 2014), and buds (Verma et al., 2006; Stensvand et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018). In some hosts, such as strawberry and citrus species, the pathogen survives as melanized appressoria on asymptomatic leaves (Denham and Waller, 1981; Leandro et al., 2001). The pathogen can also be introduced into the field with infected seeds (Thomas and Sweetingham, 2004) or transplants (Howard et al., 1992); however, in our model, infected seeds and transplants are not considered primary inoculum sources, as we assume farmers use pathogen-free propagating material.
Primary inoculum consists of fresh conidia produced in acervuli under favorable conditions of temperature (10 to 30°C for most clades) and moisture (e.g., wetness periods longer than 6 hours) from overwintered sources throughout the cropping season (Moral and Trapero, 2012; Stensvand et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018). Conidia are splash-dispersed by rain (Denham and Waller, 1981; Chakraborty and Billard, 1995; Madden et al., 1996; Madden, 1997; Guyot et al., 2005; Buirchell et al., 2006), deposited on plant surfaces, and germinate. The germ tubes then produce appressoria, which form infection pegs that penetrate the host cuticle and epidermal cell walls (Perfect et al., 1999). Penetration through stomata or wounds by germ tubes without appressoria formation is rare (Zulqarnain et al., 1996). Infection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after a symptomless biotrophic phase, leading to a necrotic phase in which host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow both intra- and inter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogen has a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), with the switch to the necrotrophic phase occurring only when host tissue and environmental conditions favor the continuation of the infection cycle. Except for a few species that exist entirely as endophytes, most Colletotrichum species develop a necrotrophic stage at some point in their life cycle (Prusky et al., 2013).
Acervuli eventually develop within lesions and produce masses of conidia that serve as secondary inoculum for repeating infection cycles and further disease spread (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017).

The relational diagram of the processes leading to epidemics of Colletotrichum spp. is shown in Figure 2; abbreviations are explained in Table 1. The model categorizes host sites into mutually exclusive conditions: (i) healthy (H); (ii) latent (L) with no visible disease symptoms; (iii) visible (V) with observable lesions; (iv) infectious (I) with lesions producing spores; and (v) removed (R), representing older, non-sporulating lesions. The model does not account for host growth or senescence, nor does it include lesion expansion.
, respectively. SPOR1 is influenced by temperature and wetness duration, while SPOR2 is dependent solely on temperature.
Table 2: This table summarizes the 17 epidemics used for model evaluation and the sources of weather data utilized in the model. Locations include various regions in Italy (e.g., Veglie and Nardò), the USA (e.g., Wooster, Ohio, and East Lansing, Michigan), and Japan (e.g., Tsukuba). The table specifies the cultivar (e.g., cv. Cellina di Nardo) and provides the duration of the epidemics, with dates ranging from mid-August to late November. It also includes details on the weather stations used for data collection, along with their geographical coordinates.
a. The epidemic was initiated by natural inoculum in the field.
b. The epidemic was initiated by the experimental placement of inoculum in or near the field.
c. All hosts were susceptible.
d. Weather data were obtained from www.mesonet.agron.iastate.edu, www.data.jma.go.jp, and https://www.horta-srl.it.
The moisture required for sporulation is provided by the host plant. The infection rate also depends on a correction factor (CF) for diseased sites (i.e., stages L, V, I, and R) and a multiplication factor (Rc), representing the proportion of daughter lesions generated per mother lesion, which is influenced by temperature (RcT) and wetness duration (RcWD). Infection occurs during the period of host susceptibility (HS), which is regulated by the plant growth stage and varies among hosts. Latent sites become visible at the end of an incubation period (IP), and visible sites become infectious at the end of a latency period (LP). Both periods depend on temperature; the progression of IP and LP is determined by an incubation rate (INCR) and a latency rate (LATR), respectively. Infectious sites produce secondary conidia (CON) during the infectious period (iP) and are eventually removed at a removal rate (REMR).
At the beginning of model calculations, H = 1 (indicating the entire crop is healthy), and the model represents the flow from one state to the next as a proportion of H, on a scale from 0 to 1. The model operates at hourly time steps.
where the parameter k (ranging from 0 to 1) represents the abundance of primary inoculum sources; f(T) accounts for the effect of temperature (T, °C) on the production of conidia; and f(WD) accounts for the effect of wetness duration (WD, hours), calculated as the first derivative of the subsequent equation. Values of SPOR accumulate in CON.
. In this equation, T represents hourly temperature, while Tmin and Tmax denote the minimum and maximum temperatures for sporulation, respectively. These temperature parameters were derived from Salotti et al. (2022).
In this equation, WD refers to leaf wetness duration (for host-pathogen combinations where the inoculum source is located in the aerial part of the plant, such as hanging mummies or bud scales) or ground wetness duration (when the source lies on the ground, such as plant debris, leaf litter, or mummies in soil). The model considers the ground wet when rainfall (P) > 0 mm or vapor pressure deficit (VPD) ≤ 4.5 hPa; otherwise, it is considered dry (Rossi et al., 2008). VPD is calculated from temperature and relative humidity (RH, in %) following Buck (1981). To calculate WD, wet hours accumulate until a dry hour occurs; if wetness is restored within 16 hours, WD continues to increase until the next dry hour. If the dry period lasts more than 16 hours, the calculation of WD stops.

HS strictly depends on the reproductive growth stage of the host. For instance, grapevine berries are susceptible from fruit set (BBCH 71; Lorenz et al., 1994) to harvest (BBCH 89; Lorenz et al., 1994; Cosseboom and Hu, 2022), and olive drupes are susceptible from the beginning of flowering (BBCH 61; Sanz-Cortes et al., 2002) to harvest (BBCH 89; Sanz-Cortes et al., 2002; Moral et al., 2009).

No information regarding the effect of WD on infection was found for the graminicola clade. The model assumes similarity between the infection patterns of the graminicola and destructivum clades based on inter-clade variability studies conducted by Salotti et al. (2022). Therefore, the model calculates RcWD for the graminicola clade using equation (14), parameterized for the destructivum clade.

are the minimal and maximal temperatures for latency.
f(T) is defined as zero. Equation parameters for each clade are summarized in Table 4. No information was available in the literature for the dematium clade; therefore, the model relies on similarities between clades regarding temperature effects.
Table 4 describes the cardinal temperatures and estimates of optimum temperatures along with their standard errors. It also includes estimates of the shortest duration of incubation (IPmin) and latency (LPmin) at the optimum temperature, with their corresponding standard errors. Additionally, the table presents the goodness-of-fit for equation (16) for incubation and equation (17) for latency for each clade.
The references for this data include various studies from Gonçalves et al. (2021), Moreira et al. (2021; 2020), and others, highlighting extensive research across multiple years and topics related to the clades mentioned.
Requirements shown by Salotti et al. (2022) indicate that parameters estimated for the acutatum clade were applied to the dematium clade.
The model accumulates the hourly progress of incubation and latency beginning with the hour when the infection occurs. When the sum of hourly progress results in IP ≥ 1, INCR = 1, and sites flow from L to V; when the sum results in LP ≥ 1, LATR = 1, and sites flow from V to I.
Infectious sites (I) continue producing conidia for an infection period (iP) and then flow from I to R according to a removal rate (REMR). The model assumes that fertile lesions continue to produce conidia for the entire epidemic, so REMR = 0. The I sites produce secondary conidia at a sporulation rate (SPOR) that depends on temperature according to equation (2); the secondary conidia accumulate in CON. Based on King et al. (1997), the model assumes that the pathogen obtains sufficient moisture from the host to produce conidia and does not require free surface moisture for sporulation.
The contribution of secondary inoculum to the progress of the epidemic has been proven for some host-pathogen combinations (Fitzell and Peak, 1984; Smith, 2008; Everett et al., 2018), but not for others. In olive orchards, for instance, mummies are the main source of inoculum all season long, and the contribution of conidia produced within fruit lesions is negligible (Moral et al., 2012); when lesions do not contribute to the progress of the epidemic, CON = 0.
The model calculates disease severity (DS) during the epidemic as the sum of the proportion of sites with disease symptoms, including visible, infectious, and removed sites.
The model was validated for the acutatum, dematium, gloeosporioides, graminicola, and orbiculare clades. Its ability to predict disease development throughout the season was evaluated for 17 epidemics (Table 2) recorded between 1980 and 2019 in Italy, the USA, Canada, and Japan on six hosts: olive, strawberry, mulberry, grape, bluegrass, and dry bean. This manuscript describes only a few epidemics in detail; details on the remaining epidemics are provided in the supplementary material.
For the acutatum clade, model validation was performed for 4 epidemics on drupes recorded in naturally infested olive orchards in southern Italy, and 2 epidemics in artificially infested strawberry fields in Ohio, USA. In the latter case, researchers provided the inoculum by placing affected fruit between the strawberry rows. Epidemics on olive developed between August and December, with final disease incidence on drupes ranging from 7% to 26% (Table 5). The correlation coefficient (CCC) between predicted and observed disease ranged from 0.789 to 0.953, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.022 to 0.047.
For the dematium clade, three disease progress curves on mulberry in Japan were used to validate the model (Table 2). Epidemics developed on mulberry leaves between August and November, with final disease incidence ranging from 13% to 37%. In the comparison of observed and predicted disease progress curves, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) ranged from 0.862 to 0.991, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.014 to 0.055. Across all three epidemics, CCC was 0.95, RMSE was 0.036, and the calibration regression model (CRM) was -0.023, indicating a slight tendency toward overestimation (Table 5). An example of model output for the dematium clade is shown in Figure 4 for JA-94. Disease assessment began in June after the summer pruning of mulberry trees and ended in November. During this period, the average daily temperature was 21.9°C (minimum = 7.0°C, maximum = 30.1°C), with an average relative humidity (RH) of 82%. There was a total of 625.5 mm of rain over 61 rainy days, and a total of 1688 hours of leaf wetness (Figure 4A). Regularly distributed rainfall ensured that the epidemic would progress during the season, starting from the time of disease onset in August until November, when a sharp increase in disease led to a 37% disease incidence (Figure 4B). The model correctly predicted this dynamic; across all three epidemics, CCC was 0.991, RMSE was 0.02, and CRM was 0.078.
Model validation for the gloeosporioides clade was performed for three epidemics on grapevines in North Carolina, USA (Table 2). These epidemics developed between June and September, with final disease incidence on berries ranging from 24% to 54%. A small average distance of real data from the fitted line was observed for the three epidemics, with RMSE ranging from 0.012 to 0.101. Concordance between observed and predicted values for NC-80 and NC-82 yielded CCC values of 0.843 and 0.993, respectively. The NC-81 epidemic is reported in Figure 5. Berries were susceptible between June 9 (BBCH 71, i.e., fruit set) and October 1 (BBCH 89, i.e., berries ripe for harvest). During this period, the average daily temperature was 24.6°C (minimum = 14.5°C, maximum = 29.8°C), with an average RH of 77%. There was a total of 216.1 mm of rain on 31 rainy days and a total of 746 hours of leaf wetness (Figure 5A). Disease incidence on berries was assessed on September 17 and 24, and on October 1, with a final disease incidence of 24%. Contrary to observations, the model anticipated the observed increase in disease at the end of the season by a few days (Figure 5B), with a CCC of 0.497, likely due to an imprecise estimation of the incubation length in relation to the berry growth stage at the time of infection. In the comparison of predicted and observed disease progress curves for the three epidemics of the gloeosporioides clade, CCC was 0.910, RMSE was 0.068, and CRM was -0.109, indicating a slight tendency of the model toward overestimation.
k used to parameterize the run, the number of field observations (N), and parameters indicating model performance in predicting the epidemic, including percentage of disease severity and incidence.
Curves, depending on the epidemic, show a consistent model performance across all three epidemics of the graminicola clade, with a Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) of 0.973, a Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) of 0.026, and a Correlation Ratio Metric (CRM) of 0.018, indicating a slight tendency of the model towards underestimation. An example of model output for the graminicola clade is illustrated in Figure 6. At MI-82, the bluegrass field was inspected at 10-day intervals for anthracnose symptoms from early May to late July. During this period, the average daily temperature was 18.9°C (minimum = 10.6°C, maximum = 26.7°C), with an average relative humidity (RH) of 75%, a total rainfall of 202.6 mm over 31 rainy days, and a total of 651 hours of leaf wetness (Figure 6A). The disease outbreak at MI-82 was recorded on July 7, with a disease severity of 3%, which increased steadily to a final disease incidence of 25%, accurately predicted by the model (Figure 6B). The model performance metrics for this prediction were CCC = 0.997, RMSE = 0.006, and CRM = 0.050, again indicating a slight tendency toward underestimation.
To validate the model for the orbiculare clade, two epidemics that occurred on white bean in Manitoba, Canada, were analyzed (Table 2). Crops were scouted for disease beginning at the end of June when artificial infection was introduced.
The results of the predicted and observed disease progress for various crops are summarized in the table mentioned. Each entry includes the type of crop, the specific clade involved, the location and year of the study, and the corresponding weather variables, such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wetness duration. Additionally, the table details the predicted infection severity, predicted disease severity, and the observed disease incidence over the monitoring period. This structured approach allows for a clear comparison between model predictions and actual observations, highlighting the model's accuracy and utility in predicting disease outbreaks across different plant species and environments.
In an overall comparison of predicted versus observed values for the 17 epidemics listed in Table 5, the Concordance Correlation Coefficient (CCC) was 0.928, and the Root Mean Square Error (RMSE) was 0.044. The similarity between the observed data and the fitted line indicated that the model accurately represented the mechanisms leading to Colletotrichum epidemics on different host plants. However, the model showed a slight tendency toward overestimation, with a Coefficient of Residual Mass (CRM) of -0.052 when evaluated for the epidemics across various host plants. The variance explained by the relationship of observed versus predicted data was represented by R² = 0.866. Based on Theil's statistic, the deviation from the unexplained variance was U_error = 86%, whereas the percentage of error associated with model bias and deviation from the 1:1 line was U_bias = 2% and U_slope = 12%, respectively.
In this research, we developed a general, weather-driven, mechanistic model for predicting anthracnose diseases caused by Colletotrichum spp. on the aerial parts of different host plants in the field. Previous models for anthracnose diseases were species- and crop-specific and considered only one component of the pathogen life cycle, mainly conidial infection (Dodd et al., 1991; Park et al., 1992; Monroe et al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a model has been developed, calibrated for different clades and host plants, and evaluated to make predictions of anthracnose patterns across multiple crops.
Our model is general in that it has one conceptual structure that incorporates the key epidemiological components of anthracnose diseases. Although Colletotrichum spp. exhibit various lifestyles categorized as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic—with hemibiotrophic being the most common (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017)—all species have a necrotrophic stage (Prusky et al., 2013), except for a few species that live entirely as endophytes (e.g., some species in the gloeosporioides clade on Salacia and Camellia; Bhagya et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). The timing of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on the host, its growth stage, environmental conditions (Wharton et al., 2001; Peres et al., 2005), and the phylogenetic clade (De Silva et al., 2017). For instance, the graminicola and destructivum clades have a short biotrophic period, while the acutatum and gloeosporioides clades exhibit a quiescent lifestyle on certain fruit trees like almond and guava (De Silva et al., 2017). Our model accounts for the common attributes of Colletotrichum lifestyles in terms of: (i) a reproductive (asexual) stage, which occurs on the host plant or in plant debris; (ii) infection caused by conidia; (iii) an asymptomatic (biotrophic) stage that can be either short or extended, depending on the incubation period; (iv) a necrotrophic stage in which host cells are invaded and killed, leading to the appearance of symptoms (lesions in our model); and (v) a sporulation stage, i.e., the production of secondary inoculum on lesions.
Our model is weather-driven, accounting for the effects of temperature, wetness duration, and rainfall on the epidemiological components leading to disease development. It operates with an hourly time step to better account for fluctuations in temperature, as well as in wetness duration and interruptions that directly influence the epidemiological processes. This ensures more accurate and robust predictions compared to models that operate with a daily time step (Scherm and Van Bruggen, 1994; Narouei-Khandan et al., 2020). However, to be incorporated into our model, new information must be provided at an hourly time step.
The first simplification in the design of our model concerns the role of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola clades (De Silva et al., 2017). However, perithecia rarely occur in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main type of inoculum in disease development. The model, therefore, focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, with asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli being regarded as the only inoculum responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics. Excluding a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein, 1963), potentially delaying epidemic growth (Schein, 1963), especially during rainless periods. This is because ascospores can be forcibly discharged from perithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity (Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).
A second simplification concerns the model's structure. It is based on the well-established framework designed by Zadoks (1971), in which host sites transition from healthy to infected with latent infection, then to infected with visible lesions, to infectious, and finally to removed (sites with sterile lesions). This structure has been successfully applied to many pathosystems under different climates, including cereals and dicotyledon crops (Djurle and Yuen, 1991; Rossi et al., 1997; Savary et al., 2015; Bove et al., 2020). The model assumes that all sites are of equal size, that healthy sites have an equal probability of becoming diseased, and that diseased sites are randomly distributed. For those anthracnose diseases where lesions enlarge, as observed in apple (Grammen et al., 2019; Nita et al., 2019) and strawberry (Garrido et al., 2008), the assumption of equal lesion size could lead to an underestimation of both disease severity and the dose of secondary conidia. A lesion expansion component (Berger et al., 1997) could be easily integrated into the model for these cases. Given that Colletotrichum conidia are splash-borne, with short flight distances of splash droplets from the source, the assumption of random distribution of diseased sites is likely incorrect. Diseased sites are likely to be aggregated in space (Madden, 1997), meaning that the assumption of equal probability for all sites to become affected could result in an overestimation of disease severity. Introducing a disease-aggregation coefficient for calculating the infection rate could account for the spatial heterogeneity in disease distribution (Waggoner and Rich, 1981).
The model was calibrated for seven major clades (i.e., acutatum, dematium, destructivum, gloeosporioides, graminicola, and orbiculare) as well as the singleton species C. coccodes, which is considered the coccodes clade in this research. Calibration was performed at the clade level due to a scarcity of information at the species level. When there was no data for a specific clade, the model utilized the parameterization of other clades. This was evident in the effects of wetness on sporulation, which was primarily documented only for the acutatum clade affecting olive and strawberry (Leandro et al., 2003; Moral and Trapero, 2012), and for the seasonal availability of primary inoculum on olive (Moral and Trapero, 2012). Further studies are necessary to clarify the impact of wetness on primary inoculum production and its longevity.
Additionally, there was a lack of information regarding the effect of wetness on infection by the graminicola clade, as well as the influence of temperature on incubation and latency periods for the dematium clade. During validation, the model was adjusted using equations from the closest related clade, applying equations from the destructivum clade for the graminicola clade and from the acutatum clade for the dematium clade (Salotti et al., 2022).
Clade-based calibration has its limitations. For instance, the acutatum clade, which impacts multiple hosts such as strawberry, almond, olive, and lupin, displayed significant variability in incubation and latency periods based on the host. At 15°C, the latency period was 5 days on strawberry fruits (King et al., 1997), 19 days on olive fruits (Moral et al., 2012), and about 10 days on lupin (Diggle et al., 2002). This variability resulted in equations for these polyphagous clades generally yielding lower CCC values, higher RMSE values, and CRM values further from zero. The effects of high within-clade variability were also reflected in the model validation results, which indicated better predictions for clades with fewer species and hosts. The acutatum and gloeosporioides clades, encompassing multiple species and hosts, had overall CCC values of 0.895 and 0.910, respectively. In contrast, the graminicola clade, a well-defined monophyletic group mainly associated with grasses (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021), achieved the highest CCC value of 0.973.
However, clade-based calibration can also provide advantages. Anthracnose diseases are often attributed to several Colletotrichum species within the same clade, depending on the region. For example, the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are found in the acutatum clade, with C. godetiae being dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia; C. nymphaeae prevalent in Portugal; and C. oriniae predominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). Furthermore, accurate identification of Colletotrichum species necessitates molecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Damm et al., 2014). Since species within the same clade often exhibit similar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a clade-based calibration may help address knowledge gaps regarding individual Colletotrichum species, facilitate practical model usage when species identification is challenging due to capacity or economic limitations, and enable predictions across a diverse range of hosts and climatic conditions.
only one host. More complete validation is needed for different clades and hosts.
In our model validation, the k dose of primary conidia that can develop from overwintering inoculum sources (crop debris, mummies, and dormant buds) was estimated empirically from disease data. This estimation may not greatly affect the reliability of the model in predicting disease progress because it modulates the final value of disease severity but not its progress. The actual value of k in a field may depend on many difficult-to-estimate factors, including the incidence and severity of affected crops in the previous season and the proportion of diseased tissues that remains in the field as an overwintering inoculum source. Inappropriate estimation of k may result in under- or overestimation of infection risk during the season. Therefore, further studies are needed to improve the estimation of the abundance of primary inoculum sources at the beginning of the cropping season.
Our model is flexible in both design and calibration. For instance, it can easily incorporate components for lesion expansion, plant growth, senescence, or host susceptibility by integrating additional model components (Loomis and Adams, 1983) and modifiers accounting for resistance components, as has been done with similar models (Savary et al., 2015; Bove et al., 2021). This flexibility also allows for easy incorporation of new information on pathogen biology and epidemiology, so that inserting species-specific or host-specific calibrations may improve prediction accuracy, especially in hosts or regions where anthracnose disease is caused by a dominant Colletotrichum species, or for clades not considered in this work, such as the boniense clade, which is economically important on several Citrus spp. (Uysal and Kurt, 2019; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).
Despite some shortcomings mainly related to its simplicity and the scarcity of information available in the literature, our model is promising. After further validation and evaluation of its ability to support risk-based fungicide applications, the model could be used to aid decision-making in crop protection.
