The U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) strawberry breeding program is now in its 69th consecutive year. Although it is not the oldest program in the United States, it holds the record for the longest continuous strawberry breeding program. The USDA's efforts began in 1920 under the direction of George M. Darrow, who had conducted a survey from 1914 to 1917 of the commercial strawberry regions across the country. This survey revealed significant deficiencies in berry quality for various markets (Darrow et al., 1933).
Darrow identified more than 30 characteristics for evaluation, focusing on three primary objectives: 1) the development of a superior dessert berry for the eastern states; 2) the creation of satisfactory canning types; and 3) the breeding of cultivars suitable for freezing.
During the 1920s, more than 130 strawberry cultivars and 20 selections of Fragaria species were utilized in the breeding program, with 44 of these parents originating from Europe (Darrow et al., 1934). Thousands of seedlings were evaluated, resulting in the naming of several cultivars (Darrow, 1937). The two most significant cultivars from this early work were ‘Blakemore’ and ‘Fairfax’. ‘Blakemore’ quickly became a leading cultivar, setting a standard for firmness that allowed successful long-distance shipping of fruit. This cultivar demonstrated wide adaptability in the southern and south-central regions of the U.S. and continues to be commercially grown in some areas. Both ‘Blakemore’ and ‘Fairfax’, along with other USDA selections such as 253, 543, and 634, became widely used as parent plants in subsequent breeding programs (Darrow, 1966). ‘Fairfax’ was particularly valued for its excellent fruit quality and resistance to leaf spot (Darrow, 1962).
Under Darrow's leadership, formal cooperative efforts commenced with state experiment stations in North Carolina and Oregon in 1928, followed by Maryland in 1937. Informal collaborations were later initiated with New Jersey, New York, and Massachusetts. Between 1920 and 1940, studies focused on sterility, fertility, inflorescence types, and responses to light. Darrow (1937, 1966) provided comprehensive summaries of these early USDA and other public and private strawberry breeding efforts.
The incorporation of flavor and aroma from the diploid (2x = 14) F. vesca L. into the cultivated strawberry F. ×ananassa Duch. was also explored. Tetraploid F. vesca selections were developed (Derman and Darrow, 1938) and subsequently used in additional crosses by Scott (1951). Decaploids resulting from this research were fertile and could be intercrossed to produce fertile seedlings with the characteristic aroma of F. vesca; however, these have not significantly contributed to the development of modern cultivars.
In 1932, the strawberry breeding program relocated from Glenn Dale, MD, to Beltsville, MD, where it remains today. During the 1930s, a root disease became apparent in several states, including on the grounds of the Beltsville station. This disease, identified as Phytophthora fragariae Hickman (red stele), posed a serious threat in the East.

Scott et al. (1962) and Scott and Lawrence (1975) provided foundational insights, which were later expanded upon by Scott et al. (1984).
Significant sources of resistance to the disease have been identified from clones of Fragaria chiloensis (L.) Duch. collected by Waldo (Scott et al., 1984). These clones are recognized as ‘Del Norte’ and ‘Yaquina’ (Converse, 1970). Subsequently, two distinct clones of ‘Yaquina’, labeled A and B, were identified, with ‘Yaquina A’ serving as a primary clone for resistance in race testing (Converse, 1970).
The development of cultivars resistant to red stele has been a primary objective of the USDA program. Various resistant cultivars have been introduced, including ‘Surecrop’, ‘Midway’, ‘Sunrise’, ‘Guardian’, ‘Earliglow’, and more recently, ‘Scott’, ‘Allstar’, ‘Lester’, and ‘Lateglow’. In the Pacific Northwest, Waldo introduced ‘Siletz’ in 1955, marking the first red stele-resistant strawberry for this region. Since then, two other significant red stele-resistant cultivars, ‘Hood’ and ‘Benton’, have emerged from the cooperative USDA-Oregon State strawberry breeding program. Furthermore, the first day-neutral cultivars with multiple resistances to red stele, ‘Tristar’ and ‘Tribute’, were released from Beltsville in 1981 (Galletta et al., 1981).
Virus tolerance is crucial in the Pacific Northwest, where strawberry plantings are sustained for several years amidst large populations of aphid vectors and a complex of viruses. ‘Marshall’, which was the leading cultivar in the region for many years, was extremely susceptible to viruses and has since been supplanted by more tolerant cultivars such as ‘Totem’, ‘Benton’, and ‘Siletz’.
The germplasm for virus tolerance in cultivars like ‘Siletz’ and ‘Benton’ was developed through Waldo’s program, which focused on selecting vigorous clones under highly infective field conditions. The primary source of this tolerance is F. chiloensis (L.) Duch. (Miller and Waldo, 1959). In the eastern United States, virus tolerance has not been a significant factor in breeding efforts, although the USDA played a vital role in introducing virus-free stocks into the nursery program and in maintaining these stocks (Galletta et al., 1981). Demaree and Marcus found that most strawberry stocks were infected with viruses that weakened the plants (Demaree and Marcus, 1951). The introduction of virus-free stocks by the USDA stabilized the situation for cultivars, which is a critical factor for strawberry breeding and the commercial strawberry industry.
Screening selections and cultivars for resistance to verticillium wilt (Verticillium albo-atrum (Reinke & Berth.) and V. dahliae Kleb.) was initiated by Scott in the late 1950s (Varney et al., 1959) using field plots infested with the organism. More recently, seedlings, selections, and cultivars have been evaluated for resistance using mycelium suspensions and sand benches, similar to the evaluations conducted for red stele (Galletta et al., 1981). One of the latest USDA releases, ‘Lateglow’, demonstrates high resistance to verticillium wilt.
The USDA Small Fruit Research Laboratory in Poplarville, Mississippi, along with cooperators in North Carolina, Florida, and Louisiana, is screening strawberry seedlings for resistance to anthracnose (Colletotrichum sp.). Anthracnose is a destructive disease affecting plants and fruits in the southern and south-central United States, involving several species of fungi (Maas, 1984). A screening method developed at the USDA laboratory in Mississippi identified two clones, MSUS 73 and 74, as strongly resistant to anthracnose crown rot, yielding results comparable to standard cultivars while also exhibiting superior internal fruit color. Additionally, several selections from North Carolina, such as ‘NC 3874’ and ‘NC 3892’, show resistance to both anthracnose and red stele.
‘Surecrop’, ‘Earliglow’, ‘Earlibelle’, ‘Scott’, and ‘Lester’ show considerable resistance to various foliage diseases.
Strawberry breeding work began at the Cheyenne Horticulture Field Station in Cheyenne, Wyoming, in 1937, with LiRoy Powers as the principal investigator. One of the main focuses of the work was studying crosses between the winter-hardy native Rocky Mountain strawberry (Fragaria virginiana glauca Staudt) and cultivated varieties (Powers, 1945). There was a significant need for more winter hardiness in cultivated types. The work continued under G. Howard until the station was closed in 1975. Eight cultivars were introduced as a result of this work, with the last being ‘Fort Laramie’, a hardy everbearing type. ‘Ogalalla’, which is also winter hardy, was introduced in 1956 and is still cultivated in limited areas where low temperatures are encountered.
A labor crisis in the 1960s in the Pacific Northwest spurred interest in breeding strawberry cultivars for machine harvesting. A portion of the cooperative USDA-Oregon State Experiment Station project was directed toward this goal, which included the Oregon State University Agriculture Engineering Department, responsible for building harvesting and capping equipment. Selecting strawberries with an erect fruiting habit that ripen most of their fruit at once and are easy to cap—important traits for machine harvesting—is feasible due to the variability in available strawberry germplasm. Inheritance patterns for simultaneous ripening of fruit indicated that early-season parents, such as ‘Sunrise’, could produce progeny with a high percentage of ripe fruit at one time (Lawrence et al., 1975). Semi-erect and easy-capping types could also be derived from parents such as ‘Hood’, ‘Benton’, and other selections from the Pacific Northwest and California. Additionally, selections that have over 80% of the fruit ripe at one time and possess the easy-cap character could also exhibit good processing qualities (Lawrence et al., 1975). The cultivar ‘Linn’ was introduced in 1975 as a machine-harvest processing berry; however, commercial machine harvesting did not materialize, and ‘Linn’ lost favor because it does not maintain berry size as plants age and is too tart for the fresh market. Currently, machine harvesting of strawberries for the commercial processing industry remains at an experimental stage in the Pacific Northwest.
Over the past 69 years of strawberry breeding, four federal locations were involved, but only one, Beltsville, remains as a USDA location with an active program. The stations in Carbondale and Cheyenne closed in 1972 and 1975, respectively, while work at Corvallis is being redirected. After Darrow retired in 1957, Scott assumed the work at Beltsville until his retirement in 1975. Arlen Draper served as the strawberry breeder until 1977, when G.J. Galletta became the principal breeder. Galletta has continued an extensive cooperative program with various states, including Wisconsin, Maryland, North Carolina, Florida, New York, New Jersey, Missouri, Maine, and Minnesota.
The USDA breeding program has produced promising selections from this cooperative work, including ‘NC 3874’ and ‘NC 3892’ for the coastal plain of North Carolina; ‘MDUS 4787’, ‘MDUS 5122’, ‘MDUS 5130’, ‘NJ 8123-5’, and ‘NJ 8219-2’ for the Mid-Atlantic and Midwest regions; and hardy selections for the North, such as ‘MNUS 99’, ‘MNUS 52’, ‘MNUS 37’, ‘NY 113’, ‘WIUS 8284’, and ‘WI 8289’. New day-neutral selections, including ‘EB 411’, ‘EB 457’, and ‘EB 460’, which exhibit multiple disease resistance, also show promise.
The USDA strawberry breeding program was initiated with clear, definable objectives aimed at developing cultivars adapted to the environmental conditions of different regions, and it continues to maintain these objectives.
