"Take-all" root, crown, and foot rot, caused by the ubiquitous soilborne fungus Gaeumannomyces graminis (Sacc.) Arx & D. Olivier var. tritici J. Walker (syn. Ophiobolus graminis Sacc.), is the most damaging root disease of wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) worldwide (3, 8, 17). Early symptoms of take-all are subtle and easily overlooked. Dark brown "runner" hyphae (ectotrophic growth) of the fungus may or may not be observed on the root surface, as G. graminis frequently penetrates young roots and grows between the cortex and stele (38). The absence or presence of runner hyphae is not a reliable diagnostic characteristic of the disease because the fungus can grow epiphytically over the cortex of resistant rye and oat roots.
Plants can be infected at all stages of growth when environmental conditions are favorable. Characteristic root symptoms include light to dark brown or black lesions and necrotic tips (Fig. 1). Severe infection can blacken and extensively destroy the root system. A black mycelial mat of the fungus may form on the basal stem or "foot" area of the plant, and most roots may appear heavily melanized. On young plants, above-ground symptoms resemble general nutrient stress (Fig. 2) and are frequently misdiagnosed as nitrogen deficiency. A misdiagnosis of magnesium deficiency, especially in highly weathered soils, along with the application of dolomitic lime (calcium and magnesium carbonates) as a magnesium source, can increase the severity of take-all and exacerbate nutrient deficiencies.
Grain losses of 10-15% from reduced root absorptive capacity and the death or abortion of tillers may go undetected in the field. Wheat fields severely infected with the take-all fungus may exhibit an uneven appearance in height by heading, with significant levels of infection often going unnoticed (3, 17, 38). Whiteheads�prematurely ripened, poorly filled, or empty seed heads�produced on severely infected plants may be scattered throughout the plant population (Fig. 3) or occur in circular to irregularly shaped areas in the field. With adequate moisture, the heads of prematurely killed plants generally have higher soluble carbohydrate levels and are readily colonized by various saprophytic fungi, resulting in a blackened appearance by harvest time. Yield losses vary by soil type, management practices, and climate in major wheat-producing areas worldwide, with estimates ranging from 1% to 50% of potential yield, translating to 0.2 to 0.5 kg/ha of wheat grain for each 1% of the plant population affected (3, 8, 17). Estimated losses in Indiana over a 10-year period (1972-1981) ranged from 4% to 25% of potential wheat yield (20).
The lack of genetic resistance and effective chemical controls for take-all imposes significant constraints on management practices, contributing to the disease's notorious reputation among cereal growers. Extensive research since the initial description of take-all 150 years ago in Australia has provided a wealth of information on all aspects of the disease (3, 17), making it an important model for studying other soilborne diseases. However, as with many soilborne diseases, the vast pool of information on take-all has often resulted in greater frustration due to its elusive control. Various hypotheses regarding the effects of cultural practices on survival, pathogenicity, and susceptibility have been proposed to explain the numerous anomalies associated with this disease.
Cation exchange capacity and tillage all have a pronounced influence on the form and abundance of essential plant nutrients in the soil. Few diseases respond as dramatically to nutrition as take-all, and disease severity is increased by a deficiency of any essential mineral nutrients (3.12, 14, 19, 22-24, 39, 40). Until recently, major emphasis has been placed on the effect of nitrogen, with a sufficiency of nitrogen being a standard recommendation for many years to reduce the severity of take-all. Specific forms of nitrogen have different effects on take-all (27, 30, 50): nitrate nitrogen increases the severity of take-all, while ammonium nitrogen decreases it.
There is a striking positive correlation between the effect of various cultural practices on nitrification and the severity of take-all. The use of a nitrification inhibitor with ammonium, along with conditions and crop sequences that inhibit nitrification, also reduces take-all (21, 22), and vice versa. However, some practices, such as planting oats before wheat in rotation, have little apparent effect on nitrification but provide some of the most effective control of take-all (3.12, 22). This suggests that the form of nitrogen, as influenced by the rate of nitrification, may act indirectly or in conjunction with other factors to influence the severity of take-all.
Five years into an intensive study on the natural biological control of take-all through continuous wheat monocropping (48), a fortuitous event redirected our attention to manganese. One of our farmer-cooperators directly drilled soybeans across our study area shortly after we harvested the wheat. Soybeans in the most severely affected take-all areas exhibited slow growth and intense chlorosis, characteristic of severe manganese deficiency, whereas plants in adjacent areas appeared normal (16). Tissue analysis of the soybeans confirmed the manganese deficiency only in plants grown in regions of the field where wheat was severely infected by take-all. A manganese sulfate foliar spray alleviated this deficiency.
