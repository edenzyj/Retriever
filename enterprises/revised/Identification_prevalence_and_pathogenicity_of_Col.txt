Anthracnose of chili (Capsicum spp.) causes major production losses throughout Asia where chili plants are grown.
A total of 260 Colletotrichum isolates associated with necrotic lesions of chili leaves and fruit were collected from chili-producing areas in Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Thailand, and Taiwan. Colletotrichum truncatum was the most commonly isolated species from infected chili fruit and was readily identified by its falcate spores and abundant setae in the necrotic lesions. The other isolates consisted of straight conidia (cylindrical and fusiform), which were difficult to differentiate to species based on morphological characteristics.
Taxonomic analysis of these straight conidia isolates, based on multi-gene phylogenetic analyses (ITS, gapdh, chs-1, act, tub2, his3, ApMat, gs), revealed a further seven known Colletotrichum species: C. endophyticum, C. fructicola, C. karsti, C. plurivorum, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. In addition, three novel species are also described as C. javanense, C. makassarense, and C. tainanense, associated with anthracnose of chili fruit in West Java (Indonesia), Makassar (South Sulawesi, Indonesia), and Tainan (Taiwan), respectively.
Colletotrichum siamense is reported for the first time causing anthracnose of Capsicum annuum in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. This is also the first report of C. fructicola causing anthracnose of chili in Taiwan and Thailand, and C. plurivorum in Malaysia and Thailand. Of the species with straight conidia, C. scovillei (acutatum complex) was the most prevalent throughout the surveyed countries, except for Sri Lanka, from where this species was not isolated. Colletotrichum siamense (gloeosporioides complex) was also common in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.
Pathogenicity tests on chili fruit showed that C. javanense and C. scovillei were highly aggressive, especially when inoculated on non-wounded fruit, compared to all other species. The existence of new, highly aggressive exotic species, such as C. javanense, poses a biosecurity risk to production in countries that do not have adequate quarantine regulations to restrict the entry of exotic pathogens.
Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi, with many of the 200 plus species known to cause disease in crop plants worldwide (Alahakoon et al. 1994; Rojas et al. 2010; Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a, 2012b; Udayanga et al. 2013; Shivas et al. 2016; De Silva et al. 2017a).
Anthracnose is a major disease affecting chili fruit, causing significant losses. Silva et al. (2019) reported its occurrence in many countries, including Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), Brazil (de Oliveira et al. 2017), China (Diao et al. 2017), India (Sharma and Shenoy 2014), Indonesia (Voorrips et al. 2004), Korea (Kim et al. 1999), Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018), Sri Lanka (Ranathunge et al. 2009), Thailand (Than et al. 2008), and the USA (Harp et al. 2008).
Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili have previously been identified as C. acutatum (characterized by straight conidia with acute ends), C. gloeosporioides (straight conidia with obtuse ends), and C. truncatum (falcate conidia) (Than et al. 2008; Mongkolporn et al. 2010). However, recent multigene phylogenetic analyses have revealed that C. acutatum is a species complex (the acutatum complex) consisting of 34 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with seven species identified as responsible for anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Similarly, C. gloeosporioides has been found to be a complex of 38 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with nine species identified as pathogens of chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Morphological traits are insufficient to differentiate many species with straight conidia, particularly those in the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes affecting chili. Thus, multigene phylogenetic analyses are essential for accurate species identification (De Silva et al. 2017a).
The distribution of Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose in chili varies across different countries that cultivate this crop. For instance, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), while only three species have been reported in Thailand (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018) and five in Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b). The main Colletotrichum species known to cause anthracnose in chili are primarily from the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes. Recently, additional species from the boninense and orchidarium complexes have also been implicated (Diao et al. 2017; Damm et al. 2019). Therefore, understanding the taxonomy, diversity, pathogenicity, and distribution of Colletotrichum species affecting chili is essential.
The aims of this study were to (1) identify Colletotrichum species with straight conidia (cylindrical and fusiform) causing anthracnose in selected regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, and (2) determine the pathogenicity of these species on chili.
A total of 260 isolates associated with anthracnose symptoms on chili fruit and leaves were collected from chili-producing countries in Asia: Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka. Type specimens and ex-type cultures are deposited in the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute.
Table 1 describes the collection sites and the number of Colletotrichum isolates from each country. The table highlights specific regions, such as West Java (associated with East West Seed Co., Indonesia) and Taiwan (World Vegetable Center collection). The figures in bold indicate the total number of isolates collected from each country, providing a clear overview of the sampling distribution.
Fungal isolates were established from lesions on infected fruit and leaves using two methods. Surface-sterilized (~1% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes) infected tissue (0.5 cm²) was cultured on water agar (WA; Crous et al. 2009). After 2 to 3 days, fungal hyphae were subcultured onto potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco) and synthetic nutrient-poor agar (SNA; Nirenberg 1976), as described by De Silva et al. (2017a). Freshly collected fruit from field-grown chili plants with typical anthracnose lesions was incubated for 1 to 2 days in a moist chamber until conidiomata appeared, followed by single spore isolation according to Choi et al. (1999). Selected isolates were also cultured on oatmeal agar (OA; Crous et al. 2009) and malt extract agar (MEA) at 20°C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Cultures were isolated and maintained either at the AQIS quarantine laboratory at the University of Melbourne or the Evolutionary Pathology Laboratory at the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Netherlands (CBS).
Cultures grown on PDA at 27°C were used for morphological analysis. Colony color and texture were examined after 10 days, and colony growth rate was calculated by measuring colony diameter 7 and 10 days after incubation.
Conidia from the conidiomata in culture were mounted in lactic acid, and the length and width were measured for 30 randomly selected conidia from each isolate, with the range and mean calculated. The size and shape of appressoria were determined on WA using a slide culture technique (Johnston and Jones 1997). Production of acervular conidiomata was observed on dried, sterilized chili peduncles inoculated with mycelia and incubated on WA and SNA media. Cultures were examined periodically for the development of perithecia. Ascospores were measured and described from perithecia squashed in lactic acid. Morphological characters were examined using a Leica DM6000 LED compound microscope with differential interference contrast (DIC) optics.
The 260 Colletotrichum isolates were initially identified based on culture characteristics on PDA (according to distinct morphotype groups), morphology of the spores, and/or internal transcribed spacer and intervening 5.8S nrDNA gene (ITS) sequence. A total of 115 isolates were identified as C. truncatum, while the remaining 145 isolates with straight conidia were subsequently selected for multigene phylogenetic analyses. Genomic DNA was extracted from fresh mycelia grown on PDA using the DNeasy Plant Mini Kit (QIAGEN, Australia), following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA quality was assessed on a 1.4% (w/v) agarose gel and quantified by comparison with a known amount of Lambda DNA/HindIII marker (Invitrogen, Australia). The DNA was then diluted to 2 ng/µL and stored at -20°C until ready for PCR.
Isolates belonging to the acutatum complex were further analyzed using partial gene sequences of five genomic loci: an intron sequence of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (gapdh), partial sequences of chitin synthase 1 (chs-1), actin (act), beta-tubulin (tub2), and histone 3 (his3) genes. Isolates of the gloeosporioides complex were further analyzed with chs-1, act, gapdh, tub2, the Apn2 MAT1-2 intergenic spacer, and the partial mating type MAT1-2 gene (ApMat) and glutamine synthetase (gs) genes. Isolates belonging to the boninense and orchidearum complexes were further analyzed with gapdh, tub2, and act genes. The genes were amplified and sequenced using the respective primer pairs for each gene region: ACT-512F + ACT-783R (act; Carbone and Kohn 1999), AMF1 + AMR1 (ApMat; Silva et al. 2012b), CHS-79F + CHS-345R (chs-1; Carbone and Kohn 1999), GDF1 + GDR1 (gapdh; Guerber et al. 2003), GSF1 + GSR1 (gs; Stephenson et al. 1997), CYLH3F + CYLH3R (his3; Crous et al. 2004a), ITS1 + ITS4 (ITS; White et al. 1990), and Btub2Fd + Btub4Rd (tub2; Woudenberg et al. 2009).
In the PCR reaction, 0.4 μM of each primer, 2 mM MgCl₂, 1 U of Taq DNA polymerase (MangoTaq DNA polymerase; Bioline), and 6 ng of template DNA were used, with components adjusted as necessary. PCR amplification protocols followed those described by Damm et al. (2012a, 2012b) and Silva et al. (2012), with the exception of the annealing temperatures, which were set at 55°C for ITS, gapdh, and tub2; 58°C for act; 60°C for gs; and 62°C for ApMat.
All PCR products were purified using the QIAquick PCR Purification kit (QIAGEN, Australia) according to the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequence analysis of the PCR products was conducted at either the Australian Genome Research Facility (AGRF, Melbourne) or the Westerdijk Fungal Biodiversity Institute, Utrecht, the Netherlands. The purified PCR products were sequenced in both forward and reverse directions, and consensus sequences were generated by alignment using Geneious Pro v. 11.1.4 (Kearse et al. 2012). These consensus sequences were deposited in GenBank (as detailed in Table 2), with taxonomic novelties also recorded in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004b). The sequences for each locus were assembled using MEGA v. 6 (Tamura et al. 2013). The GenBank accession numbers for all isolates utilized in the phylogenetic analyses are listed in Table 2.
Gene sequences from each isolate were analyzed using Geneious Pro v. 11.1.4, aligned via CLUSTALW2 (Larkin et al. 2007), and manually edited where necessary. ITS and tub2 sequences from selected isolates representing all species complexes were analyzed to determine their respective clades, and an initial phylogenetic tree was constructed using a maximum likelihood analysis (ML) implemented in MEGA v. 6 with 1000 bootstrap replicates (data not shown). For isolates from the acutatum complex, concatenated datasets were created, comprising sequences of ITS, chs-1, act, gapdh, his3, and tub2 genes. In the case of isolates from the gloeosporioides complex, two concatenated datasets were generated, one including ITS, chs-1, act, gapdh, and tub2 gene sequences, and another with ApMat and gs gene sequences. For isolates from the boninense and orchidearum complexes, concatenated datasets were generated comprising ITS, gapdh, act, and tub2 gene sequences. Selected reference or ex-type strains from each complex were included in the analyses (Damm et al. 2012b, 2019; Marin-Felix et al. 2017; Weir et al. 2012).
Pathogenicity tests on chili fruit were conducted using only Colletotrichum isolates with straight conidia, as previous studies have extensively examined the pathogenicity of C. truncatum in chili (Mongkolporn et al. 2010; Ranathunge et al. 2012). The study included 15 representative isolates of C. scovillei from Indonesia, Thailand, and Taiwan, 10 isolates of C. siamense from Indonesia and Thailand, and one isolate each from the other eight species with straight conidia. Detached mature red chili fruits (Capsicum annuum, genotype Bangchang) were used for the pathogenicity assay, following the methodology outlined by De Silva et al. (2017a). The pathogenicity of each isolate was tested using both non-wound and wound inoculation methods. Three replicate fruits were tested per isolate, and the experiments were repeated three times.
are the random effects of replicate, replicate by species interaction, replicate by isolate within species interaction, and error, respectively. Separate analyses were conducted for wound and non-wound data, as preliminary analysis indicated a significant species by wound interaction. Least squared means were estimated for each species, and t-tests were performed between each pair of means.
The Colletotrichum isolates with falcate conidia and ITS sequences matching those of the ex-type of C. truncatum were the most common (n = 115), representing 44% of all isolates. C. truncatum was found in collections from Indonesia, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand. However, C. truncatum isolates were not included in the collection from the World Vegetable Center in Taiwan, as only species with straight conidia were selected for identification. The remaining 56% of isolates (n = 145) were of species with straight conidia, primarily belonging to the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes.
For the 69 isolates and 29 reference species in the acutatum complex, the phylogenetic analysis of the combined data sets using six genes (ITS, tub2, gapdh, chs-1, act, and his3) included 100 isolates, with C. boninense (CBS 123755) serving as the outgroup. This analysis comprised 2,315 characters, including alignment gaps and excluded characters. The Bayesian analysis of this alignment, based on 629 unique site patterns (ITS: 108, tub2: 134, gapdh: 151, act: 86, chs-1: 54, and his3: 96), lasted 3,040,000 generations, resulting in 60,802 total trees, of which 45,602 were used to calculate posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis yielded a maximum of 1,000 equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values of the maximum parsimony analysis (MP > 49%) and Bayesian inference posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes. Overall, the clades recognized in the species received similar support values, although associations between some species did not receive similar support, for example, the node linking C. paranaense and C. melonis (MP < 50% / PP = 0.99). The phylogenetic analyses of the acutatum complex identified C. scovillei as the most prevalent species in Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan, while it was not isolated from Sri Lanka.
The table presents data on various Colletotrichum isolates collected from different regions, specifically Indonesia and Thailand. It lists the isolate codes, their respective geographic origins, and additional numerical identifiers that may indicate characteristics such as pathogenicity or species grouping. Each row corresponds to a distinct isolate, with information neatly organized to facilitate comparisons between isolates from different regions. The information appears to be partially incomplete or encoded with numerical values (e.g., “64/-”, “99/1”) that might relate to specific traits or attributes relevant to the study. This structured format allows for easy reference and analysis of the collected data across different isolates.
The context presents a detailed listing of various UOM (Unit of Measurement) and CPC (Culture Collection) identifiers for fungal isolates from different countries, primarily Thailand, Indonesia, and Taiwan, along with their corresponding species names. The information appears to be related to phylogenetic studies, possibly focusing on different Colletotrichum species and their genetic variations.
The table includes a series of UOM identifiers, which denote specific isolates collected from Thailand, Malaysia, and Taiwan, alongside their associated CPC numbers.
Each entry lists a specific fungal species, some with additional details like their collection numbers.
Notably, there are various CPC entries with associated values indicating specific characteristics, such as growth rates or other biological traits.
For example, C. scovillei is recorded multiple times across different CPC identifiers, indicating its prevalence in the dataset. Additionally, there are references to support values for phylogenetic trees, illustrating the relationships among these isolates and suggesting clustering patterns based on genetic analysis.
The context also references figures depicting phylogenetic trees that visualize these relationships, detailing bootstrap support and Bayesian posterior probabilities for the different isolates analyzed, thus providing insights into their evolutionary history.
Figure 1 illustrates the first of 1,000 equally most parsimonious trees obtained from a heuristic search of various gene sequences from Colletotrichum isolates in the acutatum complex. Bootstrap support values (MP > 49%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) are shown at the nodes, with the tree rooted to C. boninense (CBS 123755). The representation uses colored blocks to indicate clades containing isolates from Sri Lanka and includes clustering details for a Java isolate related to C. brisbanense.
Figure 2 details a phylogenetic analysis of four isolates and ten reference species in the boninense complex using five gene datasets. The analysis includes significant support values at the nodes, highlighting C. karsti as the most prevalent species identified in Indonesia.
Figure 2 details a phylogenetic analysis of four isolates and ten reference species in the boninense complex using five gene datasets. The analysis includes significant support values at the nodes, highlighting C. karsti as the most prevalent species identified in Indonesia.
Figure 2 displays one of the three equally most parsimonious trees obtained from a heuristic search of the combined ITS, tub2, gapdh, and chs-1 sequence alignment of Colletotrichum isolates in the boninense complex. The parsimony bootstrap support values (MP > 49%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) are shown at the nodes (MP/PP). The tree is rooted to C. truncatum (CBS 151.35). The bar indicates 30 changes, and colored blocks represent clades containing isolates from chili.
The table lists various strains, their origins, and corresponding CBS or ICMP numbers. For example, C. aeschynomenes (CPC 30209) from Indonesia shows a support value of 98/1, while C. nupharicola strains exhibit varying degrees of support (e.g., -/1 for ICMP 17938). Notably, C. musae (CMM 4083) has a support of 99/1, indicating high confidence in its phylogenetic placement.
Figure 3 presents a phylogenetic analysis of Colletotrichum isolates in the gloeosporioides complex, based on a 50% majority rule consensus tree derived from Bayesian analysis of the ApMat and gs regions. The parsimony bootstrap support values (MP > 49%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) are again indicated at the nodes (MP/PP). The tree is rooted to C. theobromicola (CBS 124945), with a bar representing 0.02 expected changes per site, and colored blocks highlighting clades containing isolates from chili.
Feel free to let me know if you need further revisions or additional information!
The analysis using the ApMat and gs sequence alignment included 92 isolates, with C. theobromicola CBS 124945 serving as the outgroup (Fig. 3). The alignment comprised 1824 characters, encompassing both alignment gaps and excluded characters. The Bayesian analysis of the combined alignment, based on 952 unique site patterns (ApMat: 520, gs: 432), was conducted over 29,500,000 generations, resulting in 590,002 total trees, of which 442,502 were utilized to calculate posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis produced 161 equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values from the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis (MP > 49%) and Bayesian inference (BI) posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes (Fig. 3). Overall, the species clades recognized in this study received similar support values, except for the C. siamense clade (MP = 92% / PP < 0.91).
Phylogenetic analyses of the gloeosporioides species complex identified 69% (29) of the chili fruit isolates as C. siamense. In the two-gene tree, a distinct subclade within the C. siamense clade formed with 100% bootstrap support, comprising isolates from Chiang Mai in Thailand, as well as Gowa and Jeneponto in South Sulawesi, Indonesia (Fig. 3). These isolates exhibited notable sequence differences compared to the ex-type reference C. siamense strain (CBS 130417), showing a 28 base pair difference in the gs gene and a 25 base pair difference in the ApMat gene. A significant subclade within C. siamense exhibited full (100% BS/1 PP) support values in the two-gene tree. While the same isolates in the five-gene tree did not demonstrate the same level of difference, they showed strong similarities among the C. siamense isolates. Additionally, in the two-gene tree, significant subclades of isolates were associated with different geographical regions.
The accompanying table presents various isolates and their corresponding data. It includes columns for the isolate name, species designation, bootstrap support values, and Bayesian posterior probabilities. Notably, several isolates from Indonesia and Thailand are highlighted, with some receiving high support values in both analyses, such as C. endophyticum and C. siamense. The data illustrate the geographical distribution and phylogenetic relationships among these isolates, indicating distinct clusters based on location and genetic similarity.
In particular, the distinct subclade of Sri Lankan isolates (UOM 1116, UOM 1117, UOM 1118) from Kandy and the separate subclade of Thai isolates from Ratchaburi (UOM 1132, UOM 1133, UOM 1134) were noted.
Other species identified in the Gloeosporioides complex included Colletotrichum endophyticum and C. fructicola from Thailand, C. fructicola and C. tainanense sp. nov. from Taiwan, and C. tropicale and C. makassarense sp. nov. from Indonesia. Most of the identified species, including the two new species, were supported in distinct clades with significant bootstrap values in both the 5-gene and 2-gene trees (Figs. 3 and 4). However, due to a lack of sequence data for the ApMat gene for some reference strains, it was challenging to provide strong support for the placement of some species, such as C. endophyticum, in the 2-gene trees. Three isolates (CPC 28607, UOM 1002, UOM 1003) collected from the Makassar region in Indonesia showed a close relationship to the reference species C. tropicale in the ApMat and gs tree (Fig. 3). Individual gene trees of the ITS, act, tub2, and chs-1 loci (data not shown) also supported these isolates as C. tropicale. Nevertheless, in the 5-gene tree, a separate subclade was formed with full support (100% bootstrap support / 1 posterior probability), distinct from the C. tropicale reference species (Fig. 4). In both trees, two isolates (UOM 1120, UOM 1119) collected from Tainan in Taiwan formed a significant distinct clade with full support (100% bootstrap support / 1 posterior probability), separate from C. salsolae.
For the six isolates and nine reference species in the orchidearum complex, the phylogenetic analysis of the combined datasets using four genes (ITS, gapdh, tub2, and act) included C. dracaenophilum (CBS 118199) as the outgroup, comprising 26 isolates and 1543 characters, including alignment gaps and excluded characters. The Bayesian analysis of the combined alignment, based on 221 unique site patterns (ITS: 34, gapdh: 55, act: 42, tub2: 90), lasted 275,000 generations, resulting in 5502 total trees, of which 4128 trees were used to calculate the posterior probabilities. The parsimony analysis yielded 284 equally most parsimonious trees. Bootstrap support values from the maximum parsimony analysis (MP > 49%) and Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP > 0.90) were plotted at the nodes (Fig. 5). Overall, the species clades recognized in this study received similar support values, except for the C. plurivorum clade (MP = 64% / PP < 1) and the C. cliviicola clade (MP = 87% / PP < 1).
The phylogenetic analyses identified the isolates from Thailand and Malaysia as C. plurivorum. Five isolates collected from Thailand, including three taken from infected chili leaves in Chiang Rai and two isolates collected from infected green chili fruit in Bangkok, formed a poorly supported subclade within C. plurivorum (Fig. 5).
Morphological observations and phylogenetic data of the straight conidia species clearly identified three novel species, two from Indonesia and one from Taiwan. Detailed morphological descriptions are provided below for all the Colletotrichum species associated with chili anthracnose.

Etymology: Named after Java, the island in Indonesia where the species was collected.
Diagnosis: Colletotrichum javanense differs from C. brisbanense in its ability to form distinct chlamydospores and acervular conidiomata on all media tested. In contrast, C. brisbanense produced conidiomata only on Anthriscus stems, with no basal cells observed. Additionally, C. javanense exhibits faster growth than C. brisbanense, with diameters measuring 60 mm, 55 mm, and 66 mm on OA, MEA, and SNA in 7 days, respectively. In comparison, C. brisbanense measured only 18.5 mm and 20 mm on OA and SNA, respectively. Phylogenetically, C. javanense is distinct from C. brisbanense, showing differences in the sequences of chs-1, with the most significant differences occurring in gapdh (7 bp difference) and his3 (4 bp difference).

Description: Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on OA. Vegetative mycelium consists of hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched hyphae, 2–3 µm in diameter. Chlamydospores not observed. Setae present, medium brown, measuring 40–55 × 3–5 µm, 2–3-septate, tapering to acute apices. Conidiomata acervular, 100–200 µm in diameter, with orange conidial masses. Conidiophores subcylindrical, flexuous, 1–4-septate, hyaline, smooth, branched, 15–45 × 3–4 µm. Conidiogenous cells subcylindrical, hyaline, smooth, phialidic with periclinal thickening, measuring 7–25 × 3–4 µm. Conidia are hyaline, smooth, aseptate, subcylindrical, straight, with an obtuse apex, tapering at the base to a protruding truncate hilum, 1 µm in diameter, prominently guttulate, (11–) 13–15 (−17) (4–) 4.5–5 µm. Appressoria are solitary, medium brown, smooth-walled, subglobose, ellipsoidal to obovate, with an entire margin, measuring (6–) 8.0 (−10.5) (4–) 3.5 (−8.5) µm.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on PDA measure 45 mm in diameter after 7 days (6.5 mm/day), colonies are flat with moderate aerial mycelium, and appear smoke-grey on OA surface. On PDA surface, colonies are smoke-grey with an olivaceous grey reverse. On MEA surface, colonies are dirty white with an ochreous reverse.
Notes: The closest match in a BLAST search with the ApMat sequence was GenBank KU923732, C. queenslandicum strain AUS22, with a 98% identity (16 bp differences), while the closest match with the gs sequence showed 99% identity (7 bp differences) with GenBank KJ947286 C. siamense isolate OBP24. The best matches with the gapdh sequence were GenBank KX578784 C. siamense (99% identity, 3 bp differences) and GenBank KU221347 C. queenslandicum (99% identity, 3 bp differences).

Colletotrichum tainanense D.D. De Silva, P.W. Crous & P.W.J. Taylor, sp. nov. MycoBank MB827692.
Etymology: Named after Tainan, the city in Taiwan, where the species was collected.
Diagnosis: Colletotrichum tainanense differs from its closest phylogenetic neighbor, C. salsolae, in culture characteristics on PDA, exhibiting sparse aerial mycelium and pale mouse-grey surface mycelium. In contrast, C. salsolae produces a layer of acervuli-like structures with deep orange-brown conidial masses and numerous setae. The two species are separable using all genes tested except for ITS, and most effectively with gapdh (7 bp difference), tub2 (6 bp difference), and act (5 bp difference) sequences. There is only one bp difference in the chs-1 sequence between the two species.

Culture Characteristics: Colonies on PDA reach 45 mm in diameter after 7 days (6.5 mm/day). The colonies are flat with moderate aerial mycelium. On OA, the surface is pale mouse-grey. On PDA, the surface is pale mouse-grey with a reverse of mouse-grey. On MEA, the surface is also pale mouse-grey, with an olivaceous grey reverse.
Notes: The closest match found in a BLASTN search for the gapdh sequence showed 99% identity (2 bp difference) with GenBank KC790761, Colletotrichum sp. strain MTCC 9664. The closest match for the act sequence was GenBank KY995522, C. siamense strain LJDY1, also with 99% identity (2 bp difference). For the tub2 sequence, the closest match was GenBank MF143931, C. siamense strain 31-B-1, showing 99% identity (7 bp difference).
Colletotrichum endophyticum Manamgoda et al., Fungal Diversity 61: 112 (2013); cited as endophytica.
Description: Colonies on PDA measure 42 mm in diameter after 7 days (5.5 mm/day) and feature pale orange to white aerial mycelium. The reverse is pale white to orange, with a black center and numerous orange conidiomata scattered over the surface. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are present, and conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae are present, moderately brown, measuring 47–95 μm long, 3–4 septate, with tapering acute apices. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, and unbranched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and subcylindrical, measuring 12–21 × 3–4 μm. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with obtuse ends, measuring (10.5) 12.5–13 (−14.5) × (3) 4.5–5 (−6.5) μm. Appressoria are single or in loose groups, brown, slightly lobed, measuring (10.5) 12 (−15) × (3) 4.5 (−10) μm.
Notes: Colletotrichum endophyticum was first described as a grass endophyte of Pennisetum purpureum from northern Thailand (Manamgoda et al. 2013). It has since been reported from several other host species, including Capsicum in China (Diao et al. 2017). The conidia length of the isolate from Thailand (UOM 1137) was slightly shorter than that of the ex-type (LC0324) of C. endophyticum (conidia measuring 13–19 (−21) × (3.5) 4.5–5.5 μm).
Material Examined: Thailand: Kanchanaburi, from fruit lesions of Capsicum annuum, 2010, P.W.J. Taylor & O. Mongkolporn (culture UOM 1137 = F5-2D).
Colletotrichum fructicola Prihast. et al., Fungal Diversity 39: 158 (2009).
Description: Colonies on PDA measure 65 mm in diameter after 7 days (8.5–11 mm/day), are flat with entire edges, and have dense, cottony, pale grey to white aerial mycelium, with numerous black stroma scattered over the surface. The center is grey, and the margin is white; the reverse is greyish green. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are acervular. Setae are brown, smooth-walled, 1–2 septate, measuring 60 μm long, with tapering acute apices. Conidiophores are hyaline, septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, cylindrical or ampulliform, measuring 7–17.5 μm. Conidia are hyaline, aseptate, smooth-walled, cylindrical with obtuse ends, measuring (10.5) 12.5–13 (−18.5) × (3) 4–5.5 (−6.5) μm. Appressoria were not observed.
Notes: The sexual morph of these isolates was not observed in culture. The conidial length of isolate CPC 28644 was slightly longer than that of the ex-type (ICMP 18581 = BPD-I16) of C. fructicola (conidia measuring 9.7–14 × 3–4.3 μm, with x = 11.53 – 1.03 × 3.55 – 0.32 μm; Prihastuti et al. 2009).

Colletotrichum karsti You L. Yang et al., Cryptogamie, Mycologie 32: 241 (2011); cited as karstii.
Notes: The four isolates identified from Indonesia in the Colletotrichum boninense complex produced distinct short conidia compared to the ex-epitype culture of C. karsti (14.5–17 × 5–6.5 µm; Yang et al., 2011). However, high variability in conidia size among different strains of C. karsti was reported by Damm et al. (2012a, 2012b), where the conidia measurements of CBS 129833 were (11.5–)12.5–14(−14.5) × (5–)5.5–6(−6.5) µm, with mean ± SD = 13.1 ± 0.7 × 5.8 ± 0.4 µm. Additionally, CBS 111998 had a conidium length of up to 18.5 µm, with an L/W ratio of 2.8. These isolates did not form a sexual morph in culture. Although these four isolates formed a fully supported (100% bootstrap support / 1 posterior probability) subclade within C. karsti, all individual gene trees (data not shown) did not provide significant support to justify introducing a cryptic species for these isolates.

Colletotrichum plurivorum Damm et al., Stud. Mycol. 92: 31 (2019).
Description: Colonies on PDA reached 63 mm in diameter after 7 days (8 mm/day), displaying grey to dark brown aerial mycelium. The reverse side was grey to light brown with yellow-orange in the center, featuring abundant acervular conidiomata that ooze pale orange conidial masses. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were present near the inoculation point, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Sclerotia were also present. The setae were medium brown, measuring 94–125 × 4–6 µm, 1–4-septate, tapering towards acute apices, often with a constriction at the apex. Conidiophores were hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, subcylindrical, straight to gently curved, measuring 26–48 × 3–4 µm, phialidic, with conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with two ends obtuse or one end slightly acute, measuring (13.5–)14–16(−18.5) × (4–)5(−6.5) µm. Appressoria were single or in loose groups, medium brown, irregular in shape, with a crenate or lobed outline, measuring (10.5–)12(−23) × (3.5–)5.5(−11.5) µm. The sexual morph on PDA consisted of ascomata (perithecia), formed after 2 weeks, solitary, semi-immersed or immersed in the agar medium, nonstromatic, subspherical to ovoid, ostiolate, glabrous, and medium brown, measuring 96–130 × 160–200 µm. The peridium was 10–12.5 µm thick, composed of pale to medium brown flattened angular cells measuring 3.5–10 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae were hyaline, smooth-walled, delicate, and rarely visible. Interascal tissue was not observed. Asci were unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical, tapering to apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 51–65 × 9.5–13 µm, with a truncate base. Ascospores were biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, fusiform, slightly curved, with a rounded base and an acute or rounded apex, measuring (13.5–)15–18(−22) × 5–6(−6.5) µm.
Notes: The conidial length of the isolates examined (CPC 28638, CPC 28639) was variable and fell within the range of the ex-type isolate (CBS 125474) of C. plurivorum (15–17 × 5.5 µm; Damm et al., 2019).
Thailand: Chiang Rai, from leaf lesions of Capsicum annuum, 7 Jun. 2015, P.W.J. Taylor (cultures CPC 28638 and CPC 28639); Bangkok, restaurant in Phaya Thai area, infected tissue of Capsicum sp., Jun. 2015, P.W.J. Taylor (culture UOM 1004).
Colletotrichum scovillei Damm et al., Stud. Mycol. 73: 100 (2012).
Description: Colonies on PDA reached 20–38 mm in diameter after 7 days (5–6.2 mm/day), flat with an entire margin; the surface was covered with short light pink to orange aerial mycelium, which turned grey over time. The margin was whitish to pale pink, and the reverse was rosy buff, olivaceous grey to brown-grey in the center, with an orange to salmon color that darkened at the center. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were acervular, and setae were not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline, septate, and branched.
Notes: The majority of isolates identified as C. scovillei exhibited similar spore shape and size when compared to the type specimen, which measures 10.5–12.5 × 15(−16.5) µm and 3–3.5 × 4(−4.5) µm, as described by Damm et al. (2012a, 2012b). However, some isolates displayed variations in colony color, growth rates, and slight differences in spore measurements.

Thailand: Chiang Mai, from fruit lesions of Capsicum sp., 2008, O. Mongkolporn (cultures UOM 1101/313, UOM 1111).
Description: Colonies on PDA reached 79 mm in diameter in 7 days (5.5–6 mm/day). They were pale yellow-white to grey with dense, cottony aerial mycelium and orange acervular conidiomata at the center; the reverse side was pale yellowish. Chlamydospores were not observed. The conidiomata were acervular, with conidiophores formed on a cushion of roundish, medium-brown cells. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline and branched, while conidiogenous cells were hyaline, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 6.5–16 µm. The conidia were hyaline, aseptate, smooth-walled, and fusiform to cylindrical with both ends bluntly rounded, measuring (13–)14(−15.5) × (3–)4(−5.5) µm. Appressoria were dark brown, solitary, circular, with entire to crenate margins, measuring (4.5–)7.5(−10) × (3.5–)3(−5.5) µm.
Notes: Isolates of Colletotrichum siamense from different countries showed variations in morphological characteristics, including growth rates and culture morphology on PDA. Representative conidial measurements from isolates representing various subclades in the phylogenetic trees are as follows: CPC 30233 (Gowa, Indonesia), 12.5 × 17 × 2.5 × 5.5 µm; UOM 1132 (Ratchaburi, Thailand), 9.5 × 14.5 × 3.5 × 5 µm; UOM 1126/F4-1C (Kanchanaburi, Thailand), 12 × 15 × 5 × 7 µm; UOM 1116 (Kandy, Sri Lanka), 10.5 × 16.5 × 3.5 × 5.5 µm. These morphological characteristics were highly consistent within each country. The species was described by Prihastuti et al. (2009); conidia from the ex-holotype specimen (ICMP 18578/BDP-I2) were reported as 7 × 18.3 × 3 × 4.3 µm (mean = 10.18 ± 1.74 × 3.46 ± 0.36), encompassing the range observed in our isolates. This species is known to be biologically and geographically diverse and can be found on various hosts across several tropical and subtropical regions (Weir et al. 2012).

Overall, C. truncatum was the most prevalent species (44%) isolated from infected chili fruit and was readily identified by its falcate spores and abundant setae in the necrotic lesions. Of the species with straight conidia, C. scovillei (acutatum complex) was the most common species throughout the surveyed countries (35%), except in Sri Lanka, where this species was not isolated. Colletotrichum siamense (gloeosporioides complex) was the next most common species, occurring in Thailand, Sri Lanka, and Indonesia (11%). The remaining species were represented by fewer than 10% of the total isolates.
In Indonesia, C. scovillei was isolated from infected chili fruit in all surveyed regencies of South Sulawesi, except in Makassar, and in the field trial site in West Java. Colletotrichum siamense was also isolated throughout the region, specifically from Gowa, Jeneponto, and Makassar. The two new species, C. makassarense and C. javanense, were isolated from Makassar and West Java, respectively.
In Thailand, C. scovillei was isolated mostly from the northern provinces of Chiang Mai and Chiang Rai but was also obtained from infected chili fruit in a trial site at Kasetsart University in Nakhon Pathom. The western provinces had a high incidence of C. siamense, and one isolate of C. endophyticum was collected from Kanchana Buri. Colletotrichum plurivorum was isolated from chili leaves with necrotic lesions in Chiang Rai and from necrotic lesions of chili fruit found in a restaurant in the Phaya Thai area of Bangkok. Additionally, C. fructicola was identified from fruit collected in Chiang Mai.
In Taiwan, an isolate was identified as a new species, C. tainanense, collected from infected chili fruit in the Tainan province, and C. fructicola was identified from fruit in Hsinchu and Nantou. Colletotrichum plurivorum was also identified from fruit collected in Johor, Malaysia.
Table 5 presents the mean lesion sizes caused by various Colletotrichum species with straight conidia on inoculated mature red fruit of Capsicum annuum cv. Bangchang. The data is divided into two categories based on the method of inoculation: wound inoculation and non-wound inoculation. For wound inoculation, C. scovillei had the largest mean lesion size at 20.3 mm, significantly larger than other species, which had mean sizes ranging from 6.4 mm to 15.6 mm. In the non-wound category, C. javanense showed a significant lesion size of 9.4 mm, while other species had sizes that varied from less than 1.0 mm to 9.1 mm. The table highlights significant differences between species, indicated by different letters, and includes standard errors for each measurement, reinforcing the statistical significance of the results.
Colletotrichum isolates collected from infected fruit and leaf tissue of chili plants in Thailand, Indonesia, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and Malaysia were categorized into different species complexes, with 11 Colletotrichum species identified and three new species described.
Colletotrichum truncatum was the most prevalent species causing anthracnose in chili across Asia. This supports previous reports of C. truncatum being widely distributed on chili fruit throughout Asia, Australia, and South America (Sharma et al. 2014; De Silva et al. 2017a; Diao et al. 2017; Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). C. truncatum has a broad host range, infecting many crop species (https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/; Ranathunge and Hewa Bajjamage 2016).
The remaining 56% of isolates, characterized by straight conidia, belonged to the gloeosporioides, acutatum, boninense, and orchidearum species complexes. Among these, C. scovillei from the acutatum complex was the most prominent species, accounting for 35% of the total isolates, distributed across Indonesia, Malaysia, Thailand, and Taiwan. However, C. scovillei was not identified in the Sri Lankan survey, possibly due to the small number of samples assessed. Previous studies have also noted the predominance of C. scovillei in Asia and Brazil (Diao et al. 2017; Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018), but it has not been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), posing a significant biosecurity threat to the Australian capsicum/chili industry. Further surveys are needed to confirm the presence of C. scovillei in Australia and Sri Lanka.
Colletotrichum siamense, part of the gloeosporioides complex, was also notable, representing 11% of total isolates causing anthracnose in chili fruit in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but it was not detected in Malaysia and Taiwan. Nonetheless, Noor and Zakaria (2018) reported the identification of C. siamense in Malaysia, likely due to a larger sampling size of infected chili across various states. Within the C. siamense clade, small subclades were observed that corresponded with different geographical regions from which the isolates were collected. C. siamense has been reported to infect chili in Asia, Australia, and Brazil, and is a common pathogen of many other plant species (Weir et al. 2012; James et al. 2014; Sharma and Shenoy 2014; Liu et al. 2016a, 2016b; de Oliveira et al. 2017; De Silva et al. 2017a; Diao et al. 2017; Suwannarat et al. 2017).
Isolates of C. siamense from different countries exhibited varying morphological characteristics, growth rates, and culture morphologies, indicating high intra-specific diversity within this taxon. Combined gene analyses of ApMat and gs sequences supported the distinction of subclades within the C. siamense clade. Recent discussions have centered around whether C. siamense s. lat. should be classified into different species groups within the gloeosporioides complex, with the number of accepted species ranging from one to seven (Weir et al. 2012; Udayanga et al. 2013). However, a recent case study concluded that C. siamense s. lat. is a single species rather than a species complex, as no independent evolutionary lineages were found (Liu et al. 2016a).
Colletotrichum tropicale is reported for the first time as causing anthracnose in Capsicum in Indonesia. Rojas et al. (2010) noted that C. tropicale was initially isolated from a variety of hosts in tropical forests in America, found in rotting fruit and as a leaf endophyte. Silva et al. (2017) recently reported C. tropicale causing chili anthracnose in Brazil. Additionally, C. tropicale has been reported in Japan, Panama, Thailand, and from other host species (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018).
All the species in the Gloeosporioides complex were identified using combined multi-locus gene analyses based on the ITS, gapdh, chs-1, act, and tub2 genes. These analyses showed higher diversity in chili than those found in the Acutatum, Boninense, and Orchidearum species complexes. The phylogenetic tree provided good resolution of the species with high support values, which reinforced the species boundaries and identified novel species.
Phylogenetic trees constructed from ApMat and gs gene sequences exhibited similar topologies to the multigene phylogenetic tree, confirming that the ApMat and gs loci are highly informative and distinguish most species in the Gloeosporioides species complex (Silva et al. 2012; Sharma et al. 2013; Liu et al. 2015). However, some recently described species (Diao et al. 2017; Marin-Felix et al. 2017) could not be placed within the ApMat and gs phylogenetic trees due to the absence of ApMat gene sequence data. Although previous reports indicated that the gs gene alone is not a reliable marker for differentiating C. siamense isolates (Weir et al. 2012), our data showed multiple base pair differences in the gene sequences of the gs loci of C. siamense, similar to those observed in the ApMat locus. Additionally, the lack of noticeable subclading in C. siamense in the 5-gene tree, compared to the ApMat and gs tree, confirmed that the ApMat and gs loci are more informative than the other five gene loci. The ApMat gene has been shown to enhance the systematics of the Gloeosporioides species complex, providing complementary phylogenetic information compared to other loci (Silva et al. 2012). Liu et al. (2015) also employed the ApMAT gene in recent molecular phylogenetic analyses of species in this complex and discussed the advantages of using ApMat in conjunction with gs to resolve phylogeny.
Although four isolates from Indonesia were identified as C. karsti in the boninense complex, they formed a subclade within the C. karsti species clade and exhibited different conidial sizes compared to the ex-type strain of C. karsti (Yang et al. 2011), suggesting the possibility of a new species. However, insufficient phylogenetic support was observed in the individual gene trees to justify the introduction of a novel species. Additionally, Damm et al. (2012a, 2012b) reported that the conidium size of C. karsti is quite variable. Colletotrichum karsti has been reported from China and India, causing anthracnose disease in Capsicum spp. (Liu et al. 2016b; Saini et al. 2016; Diao et al. 2017). It has the widest known host range and distribution of all species in the boninense complex (Damm et al. 2012b). Most C. karsti strains have been isolated as endophytes, although a few were derived from diseased plant tissues. This species is primarily associated with dicotyledonous plants, but some strains have also been found in monocotyledonous families, particularly Orchidaceae and Musaceae (Damm et al. 2012b).
Colletotrichum plurivorum was identified for the first time as a cause of anthracnose in Thailand and Malaysia. The five C. plurivorum isolates from chili in Thailand formed a distinct subclade with high support values within the C. plurivorum subclade, and were separated from C. cliviicola (syn. C. cliviae, Damm et al. 2019). Additionally, the C. plurivorum isolates exhibited a characteristic sexual morph in culture that was not reported for C. cliviicola (Yang et al. 2009).
Colletotrichum plurivorum was originally described as C. sichuanensis from Capsicum annuum in the Sichuan Province of China (Nguyen et al. 2010; Liu et al. 2016b). However, the name was deemed invalid because no holotype specimen was cited (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018; Damm et al. 2019).
Pathogenicity tests of Colletotrichum spp. from chili revealed that, while all species were pathogenic on chili fruits after wounding the surface, most produced a low level of infection on non-wounded fruit. This illustrates the importance of the cuticle acting as a barrier to infection by Colletotrichum spp. (Auyong et al. 2015) and emphasizes the need for informed and standardized inoculation techniques in pathogenicity assays. Some species, such as C. tropicale, C. makassarense, and C. plurivorum, which exhibited low infection levels in the assays on non-wounded fruit, may have a predominantly endophytic lifestyle and then switch to a necrotrophic lifestyle to complete their life cycle (De Silva et al. 2017b). However, further pathogenicity tests on different chili cultivars and at varying fruit maturity stages are necessary to comprehensively evaluate their pathogenicity. Pathogenicity testing of C. plurivorum on chili leaves and fruits showed that isolates collected from Chiang Rai and Malaysia could infect leaves but not fruits (results not shown), suggesting they might be specialized leaf pathogens. In contrast, two isolates of C. plurivorum from Bangkok did not infect leaves but did infect wounded fruits, demonstrating the pathogenic variation that can exist within a single species.
Mongkolporn et al. (2010) identified pathotypes of C. truncatum, C. scovillei (formerly C. acutatum), and C. siamense (formerly C. gloeosporioides) within isolates of each species from Thailand. Pathotypes were identified by inoculating wounded fruits of Capsicum baccatum and C. chinense genotypes. All isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum by Mongkolporn et al. (2010) were subsequently re-identified as C. siamense and C. scovillei, respectively, except for isolate UOM 1137 (F5-2D), which was classified as C. endophyticum. Isolate UOM 1137 was pathogenic in both wound and non-wound bioassays and was classified in the most virulent C. siamense pathotype group (PCg1-R) in Mongkolporn et al. (2010). This contrasts with the study by Manamgoda et al. (2013), where C. endophyticum was described as an endophyte of Pennisetum purpureum. The severity of infection in chili may indicate that Capsicum annuum is the preferred host for C. endophyticum, while P. purpureum is a less favored host, where the pathogen can infect but exists in an endophytic lifestyle. Additionally, isolate UOM 1137 has shorter spores than the type isolate of C. endophyticum, indicating that further isolates of this species need to be collected from chili plants and P. purpureum in Thailand to confirm taxonomy and pathogenicity.
Multigene phylogenetic analyses of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of Capsicum in Asia showed high species diversity, identifying 11 different Colletotrichum species, including three novel species. Although C. siamense has been reported to infect many plant species before, this is the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose in chili in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Additionally, this is the first report of C. fructicola infecting chili in Thailand and Taiwan. All three novel species are new additions to the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili. More surveys in countries in Asia and Oceania are needed to identify the diversity and prevalence of species causing chili anthracnose. Understanding the taxonomy and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. has significant implications for fruit and vegetable industries, particularly regarding the serious biosecurity concerns associated with the introduction of exotic pathogens.
