Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds is a common pathogen affecting a wide range of crops and non-cultivated plant species. The fungus is cosmopolitan and causes significant crop losses annually. Symptoms of the disease can include fruit rots, as well as shoot, leaf, and flower blights. Common hosts encompass many dicotyledonous plants, including strawberries, apples, citrus, and stone fruits; serious diseases have also been reported on leatherleaf ferns and pines. Notably, there are no known reports of C. acutatum affecting grasses. While well-documented from agricultural hosts, recent findings of C. acutatum in a moribund sea turtle and a native forest suggest it may inhabit other less-studied niches.
C. acutatum was first described as a separate species by Simmonds. Many isolates now identified as C. acutatum were either classified under C. gloeosporioides or considered species of Gloeo sporium. C. acutatum affects hosts that are also targeted by other Colletotrichum species, possibly leading to its earlier misidentification. For instance, strawberries can be affected by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae. The latter two typically cause petiole and stolon lesions, as well as crown rot on strawberries.

C. acutatum manifests symptoms on flowers, leaves, petioles, and roots, but it is most significant as a fruit rot pathogen in strawberries. It also affects citrus, apples, mangoes, papayas, and avocados, alongside C. gloeosporioides. In citrus, C. gloeosporioides is a common saprophyte and can cause postharvest anthracnose due to preharvest quiescent infections. Although C. acutatum does not cause postharvest anthracnose in citrus, it leads to specific diseases like postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose. On apples, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum both contribute to bitter rot, but C. acutatum is not known to infect apple leaves.
We explore our understanding of the ability of Colletotrichum acutatum to move between hosts and cause disease, as well as the genetic relatedness of isolates from different hosts. Information in some areas is limited, leading us to identify gaps in our understanding of the diseases caused by C. acutatum and potential areas for future research.
Morphology of C. acutatum. C. acutatum is an Ascomycete classified in the Pyrenomycetes and included in the family Phyllachoraceae. Colonies of C. acutatum are usually white initially but later become covered with pink to orange conidial masses. Cultures from certain hosts are highly chromogenic and excrete red and pink pigments into the culture media. The primary production of conidia occurs in acervuli; however, C. acutatum can also form secondary conidia on the surfaces of living leaves. Conidia are typically ellipsoid and fusiform at least at one end, differing from C. gloeosporioides, which generally has both ends rounded. Setae are usually sparse or not produced at all. Pigmented appressoria form upon germination of the conidia and vary in shape and size.
The sexual stage of certain genetic subgroups of C. acutatum has been characterized under laboratory conditions and designated as Glomerella acutata. Research indicates that many isolates from diverse hosts can mate and form mature perithecia in culture. Crosses within isolates in group C, as well as some intergroup crosses, exhibit high fertility, while others show weak fertility or infertility. However, mating compatibility in C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species is complex.
Differentiation of C. acutatum from Other Species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 µl/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.
A significant effort has been dedicated to identifying which species of Colletotrichum are involved in various anthracnose-type diseases of plants and developing tools for their identification and differentiation. Multiple hosts can be affected by a single species, while multiple species can impact a single host. Simmonds was the first to describe C. acutatum as a new species, distinct from others.
While the role and identity of species involved in anthracnose diseases is not always clear, we now have a much better understanding of the different species and the means to differentiate them. Almond anthracnose, for example, was previously thought to be caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, based on the morphology of the pathogen. More recently, almond isolates from California and Israel have been identified as C. acutatum, primarily through the use of molecular tools. These tools have been instrumental in determining not only the identities of isolates but also the relationships among them. The citrus postbloom fruit drop pathogen was also originally identified as C. gloeosporioides but was later found to be C. acutatum.
Intraspecific relationships of C. acutatum sensu lato may be considered as a group species, and the relationships among populations from different host plants remain unclear. Two subspecific forms or physiological taxa of C. acutatum have been described: C. acutatum f. sp. pineum and C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum. The former was not separated morphologically from C. acutatum, being designated primarily based on its pathogenicity to pines. C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum was distinguished based on pink and red pigments in the agar medium during culture. Although several studies have characterized isolates, there are currently no formally accepted subspecific nomenclatural designations within C. acutatum.
Often, C. acutatum sensu Simmonds from fruit crops is distinguished from other groups of isolates from diverse crop species. Research by Lardner et al. has identified several groups of isolates based on morphology, supported by RAPD analysis and vegetative compatibility. They found that C. acutatum f. sp. pineum from New Zealand and Australia formed two separate groups. According to Guerber et al., isolates from pine in New Zealand were categorized into three groups (A, B, and C) which included isolates from diseased fruit, while two additional groups (D and E) were from lupine.

This table summarizes the various plant tissues impacted by Colletotrichum acutatum, a fungal pathogen, across different host plants. The affected tissues include young leaves/twigs, flowers, fruit preharvest, fruit postharvest, and roots/crowns. The notation used indicates that "–" signifies no symptoms, "+" indicates the presence of symptoms, and "(+)" denotes that symptoms occur but are not common.
This figure illustrates the symptoms of anthracnose on almond foliage, fruit, and branches. Image A shows mummified almond fruit on the left, characterized by pink to orange sporulating lesions, and a mature fruit on the right with recent gumming infections. Image B depicts symptoms on foliage and fruit (indicated by an arrow) on a detached branch. Image C highlights an affected immature fruit, displaying external symptoms on the top fruit and internal symptoms on the bottom fruit. Image D illustrates dieback of almond branches caused by anthracnose. All bars in the images represent a scale of 1 cm.
In the subsequent text, it discusses research on C. acutatum and its genetic diversity. Primed PCR and AT-rich DNA analyses identified four subgroups of the pathogen. Subgroup I contains isolates from various hosts, including almond, apple, peach, and pecan in the U.S., while Israeli isolates from almond belong to subgroup IV. Other studies revealed that isolates from numerous hosts across different countries clustered into the same genetic subgroups, suggesting a lack of host specificity but some evidence of specialization for certain hosts, like key lime.
Research findings by Peres et al. showed that isolates from citrus flowers affected by postbloom fruit drop were closely related regardless of their geographic origin, indicating a complex interaction between the pathogen's evolution and its hosts. The emergence of postbloom fruit drop in Belize in 1979, with earlier informal reports from the 1950s and 1960s, highlights the rapid spread and impact of the disease on citrus yield.
C. acutatum infects susceptible cultivars, particularly almond, as a general necrotroph affecting young tissues, including leaves, twigs, flowers, and fruit (1,2,26). When rain occurs during warm weather, newly developing shoots and flowers may be severely blighted. A similar situation occurs with key lime, where all shoots and leaves can be killed by the pathogen (6,83). In both cases, destructive and disfiguring lesions appear on fruit.
Interestingly, all young tissues of key lime are susceptible and severely attacked by C. acutatum. However, on sweet orange and most other citrus crops, including Tahiti lime, only flower tissues are infected, leading to postbloom fruit drop; vegetative tissues remain immune. Isolates of C. acutatum from key lime induce symptoms of postbloom fruit drop on sweet orange, while isolates from affected sweet orange produce minimal anthracnose damage on key lime (6). This type of fruit drop is unique among diseases caused by C. acutatum, as symptoms are induced by plant hormones. Natural fruit abscission typically occurs at the peduncle base, but postbloom fruit drop results in abscission at the fruit's base, leaving persistent calyces and peduncles. Leaves surrounding infected inflorescences often become small and disfigured. Genes responsible for ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthesis and indole-3-acetic acid regulation are highly induced by C. acutatum infection. Indole acetic acid levels can increase up to 140-fold in infected petals compared to healthy controls.
On some hosts, such as apple and blueberry, C. acutatum poses a preharvest problem and also acts as a postharvest pathogen. Quiescent infections occurring before harvest develop as the fruit ripens, leading to ripe rot of blueberry and bitter rot of apple after harvest. Postharvest symptoms can also emerge with anthracnose diseases affecting peaches, almonds, and other stone fruits. Additionally, many tropical fruits like avocado, mango, papaya, and guava can suffer from postharvest decay due to quiescent infections established in the field.
Many inoculation studies have been conducted with Colletotrichum spp., demonstrating that most isolates are relatively non-host-specific. However, relatively few studies have addressed the host specificity of C. acutatum. Bernstein et al. inoculated non-wounded, detached ripe peach fruit with isolates of Colletotrichum spp. from various hosts and found that lesion size was not related to the source of the isolate. Freeman and Shabi inoculated detached nectarine, mango, avocado, almond, and apple fruit with conidial suspensions of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach. All isolates produced lesions on the fruit, but it was necessary to wound the mango fruit to obtain infection. Peres et al. found that a C. acutatum isolate from strawberry produced lesions on wounded, detached fruit of avocado, guava, papaya, mango, and passion fruit, but not on banana. Isolates from strawberry also produced lesions on both wounded and non-wounded fruit of pear, peach, nectarine, and apple. Thus, it appears that C. acutatum has a broad host range, at least among fruit crops, and is relatively nonspecific. However, many of the above studies were conducted in the laboratory using detached and wounded fruit. The movement of C. acutatum from one fruit crop to another under natural conditions has not been demonstrated, and molecular groups often seem to be host-specific.
Isolates from certain hosts do exhibit some specificity. The pathogenicity of C. acutatum isolates from lupine, pine, tomato, and persimmon fruit was evaluated on pine and lupine seedlings. All isolates from pine were non-pathogenic or weakly pathogenic to lupine and vice versa. The fruit isolates were not pathogenic on either pine or lupine.
In Israel, inoculation of isolates of C. acutatum from anemone and strawberry into each host resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms on both plant species. Molecular studies indicated that the isolates from the two hosts were similar and formed a single genetic subgroup. Isolates of C. acutatum were recovered from pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, as well as from weeds of the genera Vicia and Conyza; however, disease symptoms occurred only on strawberry. C. acutatum isolates from tulip tree in Argentina were also pathogenic to strawberry fruit. Thus, strawberry isolates of C. acutatum can parasitize and cause disease on other hosts or, alternatively, survive on other crops and weeds without producing symptoms.
Dispersal of C. acutatum typically occurs through conidia produced in acervuli on host tissue, which are usually rain-splash dispersed. On low-growing crops like strawberry, conidia are spread over short distances, and the use of straw as ground cover can significantly reduce dispersal. In tree crops, dispersal by wind-blown rain can occur over much greater distances. With repeated cycles of infection on sweet orange flowers, post-bloom fruit drop of citrus can spread over large areas in a single season. On citrus, environmental factors, amounts of inoculum, and other factors affecting the epidemiology of post-bloom fruit drop have been used to develop models to predict disease and forecast the need for fungicide applications.
The role of epiphytic stages and quiescent infections in the survival of the fungus Colletotrichum acutatum is not fully understood, particularly concerning the many diseases it causes. For instance, in the case of postbloom fruit drop in citrus, appressoria on mature tissues are essential for the pathogen's survival. Since flowers are the only susceptible tissues and occur only seasonally, the fungus survives as appressoria and quiescent infections on mature leaves. When flowers appear, leachates from the flowers induce the germination of appressoria and the production of conidia, which can then infect new flowers.
In strawberries, C. acutatum is typically introduced into production fields from nurseries. While some plants may exhibit symptoms, often the pathogen is introduced through asymptomatic leaves or petioles, likely as appressoria or quiescent infections. It remains unclear whether quiescent infections develop into lesions or if appressoria germinate to produce conidia. However, conidia of C. acutatum can generate several secondary conidia from each deposited conidium on the leaf surface. This suggests that the fungus is reproducing by utilizing nutrients on the leaf surface rather than relying on reserves from the original conidium. In these instances, it appears that the fungus is growing as an epiphyte rather than producing quiescent infections.
Recent studies on blueberries indicate that flower buds can become infected and produce quiescent infections during summer, allowing the pathogen to overwinter in these structures. In almonds, it seems that mummified fruit remaining on the tree throughout dormancy serve as the primary source of conidia for infections in the spring.
The role of alternative hosts in the disease cycles caused by C. acutatum is also not well understood. The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.
Although C. acutatum isolates from tropical fruits can cross-infect under laboratory conditions, the extent of cross-infection in nature and the degree to which disease cycles operate on individual hosts require further investigation.
Colletotrichum acutatum appears to compete poorly as a saprophyte but can survive in soil and on inanimate surfaces for various periods, depending on the conditions. Eastburn and Gubler found that mycelium in strawberry tissue survived in air-dried soil for at least seven weeks, even at temperatures up to 40°C, and it remained viable in moist soil for seven weeks at both 10°C and 25°C. Freeman et al. reported that conidia of C. acutatum survived for at least one year in air-dry soil; however, in soil at field capacity, conidia survived for less than two weeks. At 11% soil moisture, the time required for 95% loss of viability was between 70 and 75 days. C. acutatum could not be recovered from strawberry crowns that were naturally infected and buried in either methyl-bromide fumigated or untreated soil after five months. In Florida, C. acutatum could no longer be recovered from buried infected crowns after 56 days.
Conidia of C. acutatum from leatherleaf fern survived for up to one year in dry soil in Florida. Survival was shorter in moist soil, with conidia maintaining their viability for about 35 days in soils with 12% to 24% moisture. In leaf debris, the fungus remained viable after 56 days when soil moisture was at 6% or less, but not at higher moisture levels. C. acutatum remained viable for at least 105 days when infected plants were buried in field plots, and conidia remained viable on fabric for 35 to 45 days.
Thus, conidia of C. acutatum can survive for extended periods in debris or soil under dry conditions. However, the fungus is unable to compete or multiply on leaf debris or in soil under moist conditions where other organisms are active.
Although C. acutatum usually produces necrotic symptoms of various types on most hosts, the host–pathogen interaction appears to be more biotrophic compared to some other species, such as C. gloeosporioides. C. acutatum survives and competes poorly as a saprophyte in most cases. Nevertheless, it has been isolated from many plant species and is not always associated with disease. This species may colonize the surface of plant tissues as an epiphyte or endophyte under certain circumstances, on both hosts and non-hosts, without producing symptoms.
O’Connell et al. and Perfect et al. described two types of interactions between Colletotrichum species and their hosts: intercellular hemibiotrophy and subcuticular intramural necrotrophy. Regarding C. acutatum, there are few studies on the cytology of the infection process and the nature of early biotrophic relationships or quiescent infections established between the pathogen and host. However, based on studies with C. acutatum on specific hosts, four types of interactions or infection strategies can be described.
Conidia germinate and form appressoria on the tissue surface, along with infection pegs that penetrate the cuticle. Internal light spots at the contact point between the appressorium and the tissue surface have been assumed to be points of emergence for the infection peg. However, on strawberry leaves, Leandro et al. questioned whether appressorium formation was followed by quiescent infections, and whether the internal light spots represented infection pegs or merely contact points between the appressorium and the host surface. In a detailed study, Diéguez-Uribeondo et al. determined that the internal light spots formed during appressorium formation on almond leaves corresponded to penetration pores and were followed by the production of an infection peg and colonization of host cells.
The sequence and nature of the infection process, including the initial penetration phase—which may involve a biotrophic or quiescent relationship—and the subsequent development of infection hyphae and colonization of the host varies and is not well understood in most cases. With citrus postbloom fruit drop, the infection strategy on leaves is presumably biotrophic. After the end of the bloom period, conidia germinate to form appressoria, establishing quiescent infections that are likely intracellular (6, 92). The tissues where quiescent infections develop are never colonized, and necrotrophy does not occur on leaves; rather, conidia and secondary conidia are produced following the germination of the appressorium on the surface. However, on flower petals, the pathogen behaves as a necrotroph. For key lime and strawberries, the biotrophic phase is very short. The pathogen produces appressoria, penetrates the host, and forms a subcuticular intramural necrotrophic association almost immediately (16). Curry et al. (16) regarded this strategy as a modification of necrotrophy rather than bio- or hemibiotrophy due to the brief biotrophic phase.
In blueberry and many fruit crops (e.g., peach, apple, and various tropical fruits), other interactions or infection strategies may occur. These interactions can be classified as intracellular hemibiotrophy when infecting ripe fruit of susceptible cultivars, or subcuticular intramural necrotrophy when infecting fruit of resistant cultivars (Fig. 10C) (90). The hemibiotrophic interaction begins with appressorium formation on the fruit surface and continues with the establishment of quiescent infections featuring a relatively long biotrophic phase. As the fruit ripens, necrotrophic inter- and intracellular colonization occurs, leading to extensive tissue invasion and subsequent sporulation of the fungus.
On almond leaves, and presumably fruit, a combination of hemibiotrophic and subcuticular intramural necrotrophic infections occurs, resulting in both intra- and intercellular colonization (21) (Fig. 10D). In this instance, colonization is biotrophic following fungal penetration but shifts to necrotrophy during intercellular growth. This is succeeded by inter- and intracellular colonization and the death of the tissue. The mechanism for the shift from biotrophy to necrotrophy is uncertain; however, C. acutatum, along with other species of Colletotrichum, produces ammonia that causes local pH increases during the transition to necrotrophy (70). In most host-pathogen interactions, the specific cellular-level interactions remain unknown and may represent a combination of strategies, as shown in the preceding descriptions.
Almond (21) and other host tissues influence infection strategies. For example, in certain cases on almond (21, 90) and most cases on citrus (92), petal tissues of flowers are infected and colonized without the formation of appressoria, and there is no biotrophic phase. Generally, these infection strategies lead to the different lifestyles described below.
Colletotrichum acutatum on sweet orange is unique (83). The fungus acts as a necrotroph on flowers and a biotroph on leaves. Thus, it primarily reproduces on flower petals and does not readily colonize and form acervuli on other tissues (6, 92). Acervuli only develop on other tissues when they are killed under artificial conditions, and the fungus does not reproduce in the absence of flowers (85, 92). Survival of the fungus during non-flowering periods occurs through appressoria that form on the surfaces of leaves, twigs, and the persistent calyces resulting from flower infections. These quiescent infections do not develop further, leading to colonization of the leaf or other vegetative tissues, and typically, the pathogen cannot be isolated from leaves. Appressoria can be stimulated to germinate and produce a few conidia artificially by applying petal extracts.
The general disease cycles of C. acutatum from different hosts often share common attributes. All produce acervuli with abundant conidia on one or more host tissues, and conidia are splash-dispersed, serving as the primary inoculum source for most infections. Conidia can survive in a gelatinous matrix if conditions are appropriate; however, they typically germinate to produce appressoria and quiescent infections. The tissues on which sporulation and reproduction occur differ among various hosts, and the fate of appressoria and quiescent infections varies greatly. As far as is known, the sexual stage plays only a minor role in the life cycle of C. acutatum. Although the pathogen exhibits overlapping survival strategies, the disease cycles of C. acutatum on different hosts can be grouped according to four general lifestyles.
Table 2 Summary: The table outlines the stages of the life cycles of Colletotrichum acutatum across different hosts, including blueberry, sweet orange, strawberry, and almond. Each row specifies the stage of the life cycle, the host involved, and the specific structures present. Key points include the tissue types where appressoria are formed, the duration of each stage, and the conditions under which sporulation occurs. It highlights how the pathogen interacts differently with each host, noting variations in tissue involvement and the nature of the reproductive structures produced, such as conidia and mycelium.
Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.
Fruit Hemibiotrophic Lifestyle (Blueberry, Apple, Stone Fruit): Fruit decays represent a common lifestyle of C. acutatum, leading to diseases such as blueberry ripe rot, apple bitter rot, and anthracnose of peach, along with numerous anthracnose diseases in subtropical and tropical fruits. In cases like bitter rot of apple and ripe rot of blueberry, acervuli are produced abundantly on mature fruit. Conidia from these acervuli are splash-dispersed, germinate to form appressoria, and establish quiescent infections on fruit, as demonstrated in peaches. These diseases can occur both in the field and post-harvest. However, most quiescent infections develop throughout the growing season. For blueberries, C. acutatum is also known to attack young leaves and other tissues, although this is rare. Thus, conidia from acervuli on leaves and decaying fruit may serve as a source of inoculum for other fruits, and the pathogen can survive as appressoria in bud scales and dead fruiting twigs. In apples, the source of inoculum is less obvious, as C. acutatum only causes disease on fruit. The fungus appears to be widespread in orchards and is easily isolated from both healthy and damaged tissue. In Michigan, where bitter rot is rare, C. acutatum remains prevalent in apple orchards and is commonly isolated, suggesting that it survives and reproduces as an epiphyte or endophyte, akin to the epiphytic–short necrotroph lifestyle.
Biotroph–Necrotroph Combination Lifestyle (Almond, Key Lime): There are several diseases where C. acutatum primarily functions as a necrotroph but can also act as a biotroph, exhibiting a combination of biotrophic and necrotrophic interactions. This lifestyle includes anthracnose of almond, key lime, and leatherleaf fern. In these instances, acervuli and conidia are abundantly produced on affected tissues. The conidia are splash-dispersed to healthy tissues, which become infected quickly. The fungus can survive as dried conidia in acervuli or as mycelia in dead tissues, including spurs and mummified almond fruit.

Once the leaves senesce, they eventually produce acervuli.
Alternative lifestyles? Most reports of the natural recovery of C. acutatum have come from agricultural hosts. However, recent findings suggest that C. acutatum may inhabit a variety of unexplored niches. For instance, it has been isolated from an immunocompromised sea turtle. Additionally, a single isolate was found colonizing the leaves of a tree species in a native forest. Whether these isolates originated from agricultural ecosystems or represent a new source of pathogens remains largely unexamined.
Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating anthracnose diseases and their causal agents. Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.
Few investigations into cross-pathogenicity and the host range of C. acutatum isolates in nature have been conducted. If this pathogen truly has a broad host range and can move freely between hosts, it is intriguing that it has formed unique relationships with each plant species. Many researchers face limitations due to narrow crop responsibilities, inadequate facilities for handling temperate or tropical crops, or restrictions imposed by biosecurity regulations, which have hindered studies of host ranges using large numbers of isolates. With innovation and cooperative efforts, it may be possible to conduct some of these studies, ultimately enhancing our understanding of pathogen movement and host interactions.

Dr. Timmer is a professor of plant pathology at the University of Florida. He received his B.S. in botany and plant pathology from Michigan State University and his Ph.D. from the University of California, Riverside. He spent two years conducting research on citrus diseases in Argentina during his doctoral program. From 1970 to 1978, he worked on research and extension related to citrus diseases at the Texas A&I University Citrus Center (now the Texas A&M Kingsville Citrus Center) in Weslaco, TX. Subsequently, he accepted a position with the University of Florida's Citrus Research and Education Center in Lake Alfred, where he is currently employed. His current research program focuses on basic research regarding the population genetics of fungi such as Pyricularia, Colletotrichum, and Fusarium. He also manages a large program addressing fungal diseases of citrus trees, including etiology, epidemiology, and disease control. For many years, his assignment was 100% research; however, it changed to 70% extension three years ago. Dr. Timmer has been active in the American Phytopathological Society (APS) and has served terms as both associate and senior editor of Phytopathology and currently as senior editor of Plant Disease. He has been an invited speaker at many APS symposia and has also been active in the Mycological Society of America.
Dr. Correll is a professor of plant pathology at the University of Arkansas in Fayetteville. He received his B.S. from Pennsylvania State University and his M.S. and Ph.D. degrees from the University of California, Berkeley. From 1986 to 1989, he was a postdoctoral fellow at Kansas State University and the University of California, Berkeley. He joined the faculty at the University of Arkansas in 1989. His current research program focuses on fungal diseases of fruit and foliage of citrus trees, employing techniques such as cultivar resistance, cultural practices, and chemical and non-chemical methods for disease management. Dr. Correll has numerous international research projects, particularly in Asia and Africa, and travels extensively. He has served terms as associate and senior editor of Plant Disease and associate editor of Phytopathology, and currently serves as senior editor of the Compendium of Citrus Diseases and the Citrus Health Management book. He received the Lee Hutchins Award for excellence in research on tropical fruit crops and is a Fellow of APS.
