Fungal isolates from chilli (Capsicum spp.) fruits in Thailand displaying typical anthracnose symptoms were identified as Colletotrichum acutatum, C. capsici, and C. gloeosporioides. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from ITS rDNA and β-tubulin (tub2) gene regions revealed three major clusters corresponding to these species. Among the morphological characteristics examined, colony growth rate and conidium shape in culture were directly correlated with phylogenetic groupings. Comparison with isolates of C. gloeosporioides from mango and C. acutatum from strawberry showed that the host was not significant for phylogenetic grouping. Pathogenicity tests confirmed that all three species isolated from chilli were causal agents of chilli anthracnose when inoculated onto the susceptible Thai elite cultivar Capsicum annuum cv. Bangchang. Cross-infection potential was evident, as C. acutatum isolates from strawberry produced anthracnose on Bangchang. Interestingly, only C. acutatum isolates from chilli were able to infect and cause anthracnose on PBC 932, a resistant genotype of Capsicum chinense. This finding has important implications for Thai chilli breeding programs, where PBC 932 is being hybridized with Bangchang to incorporate anthracnose resistance into chilli cultivars.

Chilli pepper fruits with blemishes have reduced marketability (Manandhar et al., 1995). Colletotrichum spp. are among the most significant plant pathogens globally, causing the economically important disease anthracnose in a wide range of hosts, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and tree fruits (Bailey & Jeger, 1992). Among these hosts, Capsicum annuum is considered the most important vegetable in Thailand (Poulos, 2002) and is severely infected by anthracnose, with yield losses of up to 50% (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). Typical anthracnose symptoms on chilli fruits include sunken necrotic tissues with concentric rings of acervuli. Accurate taxonomic identification is crucial for plant breeding and disease management (Freeman et al., 1998). Traditionally, identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species were based on morphological characteristics such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence of setae or a teleomorph, and cultural characteristics like colony morphology.
Accepted 20 August 2007. To overcome taxonomic problems associated with traditional identification methods, DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize and resolve the taxonomic complexity of some fungal genera, such as Fusarium (O’Donnell et al., 1998), Pestalotiopsis (Jeewon et al., 2004), and Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005). Cannon et al. (2000) stated that data derived from nucleic acid analyses should provide the most reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, sequence analysis of the ITS regions proved useful in studying the phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum species (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005).
Starter cultures were prepared by plating each isolate directly onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) at room temperature (25 °C). Three 4-mm plugs were aseptically punched from actively sporulating areas near the growing edge of a 5-day-old culture of each isolate. Each plug was then placed onto new PDA plates and incubated under the same conditions as the starter cultures. Three cultures of every isolate were investigated. The cultures were incubated at room temperature (25 °C) for 7 days, during which the size and shape of 20 conidia harvested from each culture were recorded. The colony diameter was measured daily over the 7-day period, and the growth rate was calculated as the 7-day average of mean daily growth (mm per day). After 7 days, colony size, color of the conidial masses, and zonation were also recorded.
Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, where 10-mm squares of PDA were placed in an empty Petri dish. The edge of the agar was inoculated with spores taken from a sporulating culture, and a cover slip was placed over the inoculated agar (Johnston & Jones, 1999). Colletotrichum isolates were collected from anthracnose lesions on chilli fruits (Capsicum annuum) in northern Thailand (Chiang Mai), northeastern Thailand (Ubon Ratchathani), and western Thailand (Kanchanaburi, Nakhon Pathom, Ratchaburi). For comparative studies, isolates were also collected from infected fruits of mango (Mangifera indica) and strawberry (Fragaria spp.) from a local market in Chiang Mai.
Fruits without visible sporulation were processed using the method described by Photita et al. (2005). From each original isolate, three 5 × 5 mm² pieces of tissue were taken from the margins of infected tissue. These were surface-sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 3 to 5 minutes and rinsed three times with sterile water. The sterilized tissues were then placed on the surface of water agar (WA, Oxoid Ltd.) and incubated at room temperature (28–30°C) for 10 to 14 days. Mycelium developing from the disease tissue discs was aseptically transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA, Oxoid Ltd.). The fungi were identified following sporulation, and single-spore isolation was conducted using the modified method described by Choi et al. (1999). Direct examination and single-spore isolation from infected fruits exhibiting sporulation were also performed. Spore masses were touched with a sterilized wire loop and streaked onto the surface of WA plates, which were then incubated overnight. A single germinated spore was picked and transferred to a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube containing 200 mg of sterilized quartz sand and 600 µL of 2 × CTAB extraction buffer (2% w/v CTAB, 100 mM Tris HCl, 1.4 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, pH 8). The entire contents were incubated at 60°C in a water bath for 40 minutes with occasional swirling. The solution was then extracted two or three times with equal volumes of phenol and chloroform (1:1) at 17,530 g for 30 minutes until no interface was visible. The upper aqueous phase containing the DNA was precipitated by adding 2.5 volumes of absolute ethanol and stored at -20°C overnight. The precipitated DNA was washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, suspended in TE buffer (1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl, pH 8), and treated with RNase (1 mg/mL).
The study also includes a table detailing the sources of Colletotrichum isolates and the reference sequences from GenBank used for analysis. This table lists various isolates, their corresponding accession numbers for internal transcribed spacer (ITS) and β-tubulin sequences, the species of Colletotrichum, their locations, and host plants. Each entry provides a unique identifier for the isolate along with its genomic data, facilitating comparative analysis and identification.
DNA amplification and sequencing were performed using PCR. Complete ITS/5.8S rDNA and partial β-tubulin (tub2) sequences were amplified using specific primers: ITS 4 and ITS 5 (White et al., 1990) for rDNA, and Bt 2A and Bt 2B (Glass & Donaldson, 1995) for β-tubulin. PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of denaturation at 95 °C for 1 minute, annealing at 52 °C for 50 seconds, and elongation at 72 °C for 1 minute, with a final extension step at 72 °C for 10 minutes. PCR products were verified using ethidium bromide staining on 1% agarose gels and purified with the GFX PCR Purification Kit (Amersham Biosciences). DNA sequencing was conducted using an Applied Biosystem 3730 DNA analyzer at the Genome Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong. For some strains of the same species, sequencing was performed in both directions to ensure accuracy. The sequences generated were deposited in GenBank (see Table 1 for details).
Datasets of ITS/5.8S rDNA and β-tubulin sequences were analyzed individually or combined. The sequences from collected isolates, along with those from BRIP isolates (BRIP 26974, BRIP 4703a, BRIP 4704a, BRIP 11086a, and BRIP 28519a), were aligned using Clustal X (Thomson et al., 1997) and manually optimized. The partition homogeneity test (Farris et al., 1995) was employed to assess conflicting hierarchical signals. The branch support of trees resulting from maximum parsimony analysis was evaluated using bootstrapping (Felsenstein, 1985) with 1000 replications to estimate the reliability of inferred monophyletic groups. Descriptive tree statistics, including tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), and homoplasy index (HI), were calculated for all parsimony trees. Colletotrichum boninense (STEU-2289) was used as the designated outgroup in all analyses.
Three representative isolates of each species from each host were selected for pathogenicity testing. The isolates studied included: C. acutatum from chili (Mj4, Mj5, Mj10), C. capsici from chili (R4, Ccmj10, Skp4), C. gloeosporioides from chili (Ku4, Ku5, Ku8), C. acutatum from strawberry (S2, S4, S5), and C. gloeosporioides from mango (M1, M2, M4). The isolates were cultured on PDA at 27 °C under continuous fluorescent light, and conidia from 7-day-old cultures were harvested.
9 (highly susceptible): >25% of the fruit showing necrosis, with lesions often encircling the fruit and abundant acervuli.
The experiment was conducted twice. Data on the areas of infected fruits were analyzed using analysis of variance (P < 0.05), with DMRT and LSD values applied for multiple range tests using SPSS software version 13.0 (Kirkpatrick & Feeney, 2006).
Twenty-nine isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from infected chili fruits, three from infected mango fruits, and six from infected strawberry fruits, all exhibiting symptoms of anthracnose. The identification of these isolates was based on the morphological descriptions of Colletotrichum species outlined by Mordue (1971) and Sutton (1992). From the chili, seven isolates matched the description of C. acutatum, thirteen matched C. capsici, and nine matched C. gloeosporioides. Three isolates from infected mango fruits matched the description of C. gloeosporioides, and six from infected strawberry fruits matched C. acutatum.
Distinct differences in spore morphology and colony characteristics among the isolates resulted in the identification of morphological groups that correlated with the Colletotrichum species, regardless of the host species from which they were obtained.
Distinct morphological types on PDA were observed in each morphological group after seven days of subculturing.
Group 1 (mango C. gloeosporioides): Colonies produced little aerial mycelium in alternating concentric zones of light orange at the center, turning pale yellow toward the margin.
Group 2 (chili C. gloeosporioides): Colonies varied from greyish-white to dark grey; some isolates (Ku1, Ku2, Ku3, Ku4, Ku5, and Ku8) exhibited diurnal zonation of pale grey to black aerial mycelium, while others (Ku6, Ku9, and Ku10) produced an even, felted mat of aerial mycelium.
Group 3 (strawberry C. acutatum): Colonies were white to pale grey, showing diurnal zonation of dense and sparse development of aerial mycelia, sometimes with pinkish spore masses.
Group 4 (chili C. acutatum): These produced pale orange colonies with little aerial mycelium and a few orange conidial masses around the center.
Group 5 (chili C. capsici): Colonies ranged from white to grey; most isolates showed diurnal zonation of dense and sparse aerial mycelium, sometimes with beige-colored spore masses.
An important comparative characteristic was the growth rate of the colonies in culture. There was no significant difference in growth rates among isolates of the same species, particularly among isolates of C. acutatum belonging to groups 3 and 4.
A statistical difference was observed in the growth rate of the three different species. Isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from group 1 (11.0 mm day⁻¹) and group 2 (11.2 mm day⁻¹) grew significantly faster than any other groups (P = 0.001). This was followed by isolates of Colletotrichum capsici from group 5 (7.1 mm day⁻¹) and isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum from groups 3 (5.8 mm day⁻¹) and 4 (5.8 mm day⁻¹).
There were three types of conidia observed in the three species of Colletotrichum: cylindrical, fusiform, and falcate. Isolates of C. capsici from group 5 produced falcate conidia, while C. acutatum isolates from groups 3 and 4 predominantly produced fusiform conidia (with an average occurrence of 80%). Isolates of C. gloeosporioides from groups 1 and 2 produced cylindrical conidia. However, there was little distinction among the groups regarding the size of the conidia.
There were few differences in appressorial shape and size between the groups. Most of the appressoria formed in slide cultures were irregularly shaped, with only a few being ovoid. Ovoid appressoria were commonly observed in slide cultures from C. acutatum isolates collected from strawberry in groups 3 and 4.
PCR products obtained from the ITS regions (including 5.8 S) ranged from 550 to 600 bp, whereas those from the β-tubulin gene ranged from 450 to 500 bp. The final sequence alignment of the concatenated ITS and β-tubulin dataset, comprising 43 taxa, had 984 characters, of which 229 were parsimony informative (23.27%), 575 were constant, and 180 were variable. Two trees were obtained when gaps were treated as missing data in a weighted parsimony analysis. The topologies of the two trees were not significantly different; one of the trees had a total length of 721 steps, a consistency index of 0.861, a retention index of 0.971, and a homoplasy index of 0.139.
In order to compare tree output with morphological and cultural characters, the phylogeny generated from the combined dataset was selected because most of the major clusters and subclusters were more resolved and received higher statistical support. As shown in the phylogenetic tree, Colletotrichum isolates fell into three distinct lineages (clusters X, Y, and Z), supported by 100% bootstrap values. Cluster X consisted of C. gloeosporioides isolates from chilli and mango, characterized by falcate-spored conidia and an average growth rate of over 7 mm day⁻¹. Cluster Y included C. acutatum isolates from chilli and strawberry, all with fusiform conidia and a growth rate exceeding 5 mm day⁻¹. Interestingly, C. acutatum isolates collected in Australia from strawberry and papaya formed a distinct subcluster from isolates in Thailand. Cluster Z, characterized by high statistical support, consisted solely of C. capsici isolates from chilli.
The pathogenicity of isolates from C. annuum cv. Bangchang (groups 2 and 1, respectively) did not produce any symptoms on PBC 932 fruits using both wound/drop and non-wound/drop inoculation methods. In the non-wound/drop inoculation, none of the isolates from any group produced symptoms typical of anthracnose. However, chilli fruits inoculated with C. acutatum isolates from strawberry (group 3) and C. acutatum (group 4), as well as C. capsici (group 5) and C. gloeosporioides isolates (group 2) from chilli, showed symptoms of anthracnose. The lesions observed were not significantly different in size from one another, indicating a susceptible host reaction, with a disease score ranging from 7 to 9 (very susceptible to highly susceptible) (Table 3). In contrast, chilli fruits inoculated with C. gloeosporioides from mango (group 1) did not show any typical symptoms.
Using the wound/drop inoculation method, lesions appeared 3 days post-inoculation, whereas in the non-wound/drop method, lesions developed 9 days after inoculation. Morphological grouping based on cultural morphology and spore shape aligned with phylogenetic data derived from molecular analysis. However, there was an overlap in conidial size among the five morphological groups studied. Sequence analyses from the ITS region and β-tubulin genes did not provide a clear indication of potential phylogenetic relationships for the isolates.
Table 3 outlines the host reactions of Capsicum annuum cv. Bangchang and C. chinense PBC 932 fruits to isolates of Colletotrichum species. The table compares the infected fruit area percentages and host reactions for different species under two inoculation methods: wound/drop and non-wound/drop. For each species, data are presented for individual isolates, showing the percentage of infected fruit area and the corresponding host reaction categorized as highly susceptible (HS), very susceptible (VS), or highly resistant (HR). The results indicate variability in susceptibility among the isolates, with some exhibiting significant differences, particularly under wound/drop inoculation, which used a concentration of 10^6 conidia mL⁻¹, while the non-wound/drop method used 2 × 10^6 conidia mL⁻¹. The statistical analysis indicates that isolates followed by the same letter within a column did not differ significantly at the 0.01 level, as determined by Duncan’s multiple range test.
Conclusions drawn by Hindorf (1973) revealed significant morphometric overlap in conidial size among various Colletotrichum species. Pring et al. (1995) noted that wounding greatly enhances Colletotrichum's ability to cause disease. Oh et al. (1999) emphasized the role of cuticular wax layers in the susceptibility of green and red pepper fruits to infection. They highlighted that differentiation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici was reliable when based on appressorial shape. However, it was challenging to delineate species by appressorial characteristics alone, as a negative correlation was found between cuticle thickness and disease incidence for C. gloeosporioides.
Sanders & Korsten (2003a) considered appressorial shape to be an unreliable indicator for species differentiation. Plant breeders must recognize the potential of C. acutatum as a major pathogen when developing new chili cultivars for resistance to anthracnose disease. Cultural characteristics effectively distinguished species from chili, mango, and strawberry, with isolates from chili classified into three distinct Colletotrichum species, a classification strongly supported by phylogenetic analysis.
Colony growth rate in vitro emerged as a crucial characteristic for distinguishing between the three Colletotrichum species. Phylogenetic studies indicated a close relationship among isolates sharing similar growth rates, with C. acutatum exhibiting the slowest growth. Simmonds (1965) and Sutton (1992) noted that C. acutatum could be differentiated from C. gloeosporioides based on this slower growth rate.
Molecular phylogenies did not show a correlation between DNA sequence data and host associations within Colletotrichum species. C. capsici from chili constituted a distinct monophyletic group, while C. acutatum isolates from chili were more closely related to those from strawberry, indicating that spore morphology and cultural characteristics reflected phylogeny more accurately than host association. This aligns with previous findings on C. acutatum (Du et al., 2005) and C. gloeosporioides (Guerber et al., 2003), despite differing views on the importance of host association in other species, such as C. graminicola (Du et al., 2005).
The subcluster of C. acutatum isolates from Australia may reflect phylogenetic divergence due to geographical isolation from Thailand. Research by Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2003) underscores the necessity for further investigation into these dynamics.
We express our gratitude to the Mushroom Research Foundation in Chiang Mai, Thailand, for their funding support, as well as to the University of Hong Kong.
The geographic range revealed both a homogeneous group and a highly variable group of isolates, with no direct correlation to geographic areas. Kasetsart University (Thailand) is acknowledged for kindly supplying some isolates used in this study. Special thanks are extended to the Tropical Vegetable Research Center, Kasetsart University, for providing chilli fruits. Helen Leung and Heidi Kong from the University of Hong Kong are thanked for their laboratory assistance, and Chutchamas Kanchanaudomkam from Kasetsart University is appreciated for her support in the pathogenicity tests.
Pathogenicity tests conducted with three species of Colletotrichum isolated from infected chilli fruits demonstrated that all isolates were pathogenic to the susceptible Thai elite cultivar Bangchang. This result confirmed that these three Colletotrichum species are causal agents of anthracnose infection in chilli. Additionally, the non-infection of the resistant genotype C. chinense PBC 932 by C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides reaffirmed the importance of this resistance in the interspecific breeding program (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). The anthracnose symptoms produced by all three isolates of C. acutatum in wound-inoculated fruits of PBC 932 indicated that C. acutatum was pathogenic and could overcome the resistance.
