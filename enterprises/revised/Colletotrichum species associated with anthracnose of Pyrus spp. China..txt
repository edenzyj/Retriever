Abstract: Colletotrichum species are known plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes affecting various economically important hosts. However, the specific species impacting pear (Pyrus spp.) remain largely unidentified. This study aimed to determine the morphology, multi-gene phylogeny, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species associated with Pyrus plants. A total of 295 samples were collected from cultivated pear species (including P. pyrifolia, P. bretschneideri, and P. communis) across seven major pear cultivation provinces in China. Pear leaves and fruits affected by anthracnose were sampled and subjected to fungal isolation, resulting in 488 Colletotrichum isolates. Phylogenetic analyses based on six loci (ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS), along with morphological examinations of 90 representative isolates, revealed...
The study includes data on the distribution of Colletotrichum species across various regions in China. The table summarizes the number of samples collected from different provinces, the types of pear species studied, and the corresponding number of fungal isolates obtained. Each province is listed alongside the specific pear species sampled, showing the extent of anthracnose infection in both leaves and fruits. Additionally, the table highlights the results of phylogenetic analysis, indicating the diversity of Colletotrichum species identified, which is critical for understanding their impact on pear cultivation.
C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, C. wuxiense, and two novel species, described here as C. jinshuiense and C. pyrifoliae, were identified. Among these, C. fructicola was the most dominant, occurring on P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri in all surveyed provinces except Shandong, where C. siamense was dominant. In contrast, only C. siamense and C. fioriniae were isolated from P. communis, with C. siamense being the more prevalent species. Pathogenicity tests conducted on pear leaves and fruits confirmed a broad diversity in pathogenicity and aggressiveness among the species and isolates. Notably, C. citricola, C. jinshuiense, C. pyrifoliae, and C. conoides showed organ-specific pathogenicity, affecting either leaves or fruits. This study also represents the first report of C. citricola, C. conoides, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense causing anthracnose on pear.

Previous studies primarily focused on morphology and ITS sequence data (Wu et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2013b), which are insufficient for distinguishing closely related taxa within several species complexes (Liu et al. 2016a). Additionally, most species reported from pear were based on small sample sizes from restricted areas, thus underestimating species diversity. In recent years, various Colletotrichum species have been isolated from numerous host plants, such as Camellia sinensis (Theaceae), Capsicum annuum (Solanaceae), and Citrus reticulata (Rutaceae). This includes Pyrus species, such as P. pyrifolia, P. sinkiangensis, and P. ussuriensis, which are commercially cultivated and have been studied at a broad geographical level, enhancing our understanding of the genus (Huang et al. 2013, Zhao et al. 2015).
Among these, P. bretschneideri, P. communis, and P. pyrifolia represent the major cultivated species in China. Pear is the third most widely grown temperate fruit after apple and grape, with the largest production occurring in China. However, the Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose remain largely unresolved, with only six species identified (Wu et al. 2013). The pear industry is one of the most important fruit industries worldwide.
Fig. 1 illustrates the representative symptoms of pear anthracnose on fruits and leaves in the field. It features images showing significant sunken rot lesions on fruits of P. pyrifolia and P. communis, tiny black spots on young and mature pear fruits, and various symptoms of necrotic lesions and small round spots on leaves of P. pyrifolia cultivars.
Despite the economic importance of pear production, the documentation of Colletotrichum spp. affecting this crop in China is scarce and remains poorly recorded worldwide. The taxonomy of the genus Colletotrichum has historically been challenging, necessitating further research.
Agar plates containing 1.5% agar and distilled water were prepared and incubated at 28 °C. Research from 1957 and studies by multiple authors, including Quaedvlieg et al. (2015), Liu et al. (2012), and Sutton et al. (2009), have utilized multi-locus sequence analysis to investigate the phylogeny of various Colletotrichum species. Previous analyses, such as those conducted by Sharma (2019) and others, highlighted the significance of genetic diversity within the Colletotrichum genus.
For the experiment, conidia were collected from diseased tissues exhibiting sporulation, suspended in sterilized water, and diluted to a concentration of 1 × 10^4 conidia per mL. This suspension was spread onto the surface of water agar (2% agar, distilled water) to generate discrete colonies, following the methodology established by Choi et al. (1999). Six single colonies from each isolate were selected using a sterilized needle and transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) plates. Pure cultures were stored in 25% glycerol at -80 °C until needed.
Type specimens of new species identified in this study were deposited in the Mycological Herbarium, Institute of Microbiology, Chinese Academy of Sciences, Beijing, China (HMAS). Additionally, living cultures of the C. gloeosporioides species complex were maintained (Weir et al. 2012, Liu et al. 2016a). Recent studies identified 14 Colletotrichum species complexes and 15 singleton species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017, Damm et al. 2019).
To identify the prevalence of Colletotrichum species associated with Pyrus anthracnose in major production provinces in China.
To validate the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species through morphological characteristics and DNA phylogenetic analysis.
To evaluate their pathogenicity by proving Koch’s postulates.
A survey was conducted in 15 commercial pear orchards and four nurseries (from August 2013 to October 2016) across seven major pear cultivation provinces in China: Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, Shandong, and Zhejiang. Two types of symptoms were observed on the fruit: 1) bitter rot, characterized by large, sunken rot lesions (10–35 mm in diameter) with embedded concentric rings.
Fungal genomic DNA was extracted using a cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer (2% w/v CTAB, 1.42 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris·HCl, pH 8.0, 0.2% (w/v) β-mercaptoethanol) as previously described (Freeman et al. 1996). Six loci, including the 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), chitin synthase (CHS-1), and calmodulin (CAL) genes, were amplified using specific primer pairs.
PCR amplification was performed according to the methods outlined by Weir et al. (2012), modified for specific annealing temperatures: 56 °C for ITS, 59 °C for ACT and GAPDH, 58 °C for TUB2 and CHS-1, and 57 °C for CAL. PCR amplicons were purified and sequenced at Sangon Biotech (Shanghai, China).
Various symptoms were observed on leaves, which included: 1) big necrotic lesions (BnL), 2) small round spots (SS), and 3) tiny black spots (TS). The BnL symptoms were characterized by sunken necrotic lesions measuring 5–10 mm in diameter, brown in the center and black along the margin, often with black acervuli on the surface secreting orange conidial tendrils under humid conditions. The SS symptoms were characterized by circular to subcircular grey-white spots, 3–4 mm in diameter, with a dark-brown margin. The TS symptoms were defined by tiny black spots of less than 1 mm in diameter, which increased in number rather than size, accompanied by chlorosis, yellowing, and ‘green island regions’ (Fig. 1d–g). Symptoms were also linked to defoliation (Fig. 1h, i).
Fruits and leaves exhibiting these symptoms were collected from various pear tree cultivars, including Pyrus pyrifolia cvs. Cuiguan, Guanyangxueli, Hohsui, Huanghua, Huali No. 1, Imamuraaki, Jinshui No. 1, Jinshui No. 2, and Xiangnan, as well as Pyrus bretschneideri cvs. Chili, Dangshansuli, Huangguan, Huangxianchangba, and Yali, and Pyrus communis cv. Gyuiot. Fungi were isolated from these diseased tissues, which were cut into small pieces (4–5 mm²) after surface sterilization. Sequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank (Table 1).
Phylogenetic analyses were performed using concatenated sequences of ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, and ITS. These sequences were aligned using MAFFT v. 7 with default settings and manually adjusted in MEGA v. 7.0.1. Bayesian inference (BI) was employed to construct phylogenies with MrBayes v. 3.1.2. Model testing for nucleotide substitution was conducted with MrModeltest v. 2.3, utilizing the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for best-fit models (Table 2). Analyses included four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains, with 1 × 10⁷ generations for the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 3 × 10⁶ for the C. dematium species complex, and 2 × 10⁶ generations for C. acutatum and C. boninense species complexes. The first 25% of trees were discarded as burn-in, and posterior probabilities were calculated from the remaining trees.
Table 2 presents the nucleotide substitution models utilized in the phylogenetic analyses for various clades. It details the models applied to the Gloeosporioides and Dematium clades, including different sequences such as ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, CHS-1, and CAL. Each model is associated with a specific set of parameters, such as GTR + G, HKY + G, and K80 + I, which indicate the complexity and fit of the models for the data analyzed. This table provides a comprehensive overview of the methodologies used in determining the evolutionary relationships among the Colletotrichum species involved in this study.
Branches were set to a maximum length of 5000. Branches of zero length collapsed, and the N value was equal to the total number of isolates obtained. All multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Clade stability was assessed using a bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Afterward, tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated. Maximum likelihood (ML) analyses were implemented on the multi-locus alignments using RaxmlGUI v. 1.3.1 (Silvestro & Michalak, 2012). Clade stability was further assessed using bootstrap analyses with 1000 replicates. A general time-reversible model (GTR) was applied with a gamma-distributed rate variation. Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree v. 1.4.2 (Rambaut, 2014). The alignments and phylogenetic trees were deposited in TreeBASE (study 22264).
Pathogenicity tests for Colletotrichum isolates were conducted using a spore suspension on detached leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan, following previously described methods (Cai et al., 2009). Briefly, tender, healthy-looking leaves were collected, washed three times with sterile water, and air-dried on sterilized filter paper. The leaves were inoculated using both wound/drop and non-wound/drop methods (Lin et al., 2002; Kanchana-udomkan et al., 2004; Than et al., 2008). For the wound/drop method, an aliquot of 6 μL of spore suspension (1.0 × 10^6 conidia or ascospores per mL) was applied to the left side of a leaf after wounding it once with a sterilized needle (insect pin, 0.5 mm diameter), while sterile water was placed on the right side as a control. For the non-wound/drop method, the spore suspension was applied to the left side of a leaf without prior wounding, with sterile water as control on the right side. Infection rates were calculated using the formula: infection rate = (number of infected leaves or fruits) / (number of inoculated leaves or fruits) at 14 days post-inoculation (dpi) (Huang et al., 2013). If the resulting pairwise homoplasy index was below the threshold of 0.05 (Фw < 0.05), it indicated significant recombination within the dataset. The relationship between closely related species was visualized by constructing a splits graph. Pathogenicity was also assessed on detached mature pear fruits of P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan in triplicate, as previously described (Cai et al., 2009).
Morphological analysis was conducted according to Yan et al. (2015). Mycelial discs (5 mm diameter) were taken from the growing edge of 5-day-old cultures in triplicate, transferred onto PDA, oatmeal agar (OA; Crous et al., 2009), and synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg, 1976), and incubated in the dark at 28 °C. Colony diameters were measured daily for 5 days to calculate the mycelial growth rates (mm/d). The shape, color, and density of colonies were recorded after incubation.
Fifty conidia or ascospores were measured to determine their sizes unless no or fewer spores were produced. The mean lesion lengths were evaluated under wounded conditions at 10 days post-inoculation (dpi). Symptom development on appressoria was induced by dropping a conidial suspension (10^6 conidia/mL; 50 μL) on a concavity slide, placed inside plates containing moistened filter paper with distilled sterile water. After inoculation, the detached leaves and fruits were placed on plastic trays covered with plastic wrap to maintain a relative humidity of 99%. They were then incubated at 25 °C with a 12/12 hour light/dark photoperiod. Following an incubation period of 24 to 48 hours, the sizes of 30 conidial appressoria formed at the ends of germ tubes were measured (Yang et al. 2009).
M. Fu et al. conducted a study on Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose in Pyrus spp., as documented in Persoonia, Volume 42, 2019. The data related to various Colletotrichum isolates and their characteristics were summarized in a table, which included details such as species identification, isolate numbers, and specific traits like morphological features and infection rates.
The table presented a detailed overview of several Colletotrichum species, showing their corresponding isolate codes, and highlighted various attributes such as Bayesian posterior probabilities and bootstrap support values from phylogenetic analyses. These metrics provided insight into the phylogenetic relationships and reliability of the species classification within the C. gloeosporioides species complex.
Figure 3: A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 51 isolates in the C. acutatum species complex. The species C. orchidophilum (CBS 632.80) was selected as an outgroup. The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS genes. Bayesian posterior probability (PP ≥ 0.90), maximum parsimony (MP) bootstrap support values (ML ≥ 50%), and RAxML bootstrap support values (ML ≥ 50%) are indicated at the nodes (PP/MP/ML). Ex-type isolates are shown in bold. Colored blocks represent clades containing isolates from Pyrus spp. in this study; circles indicate isolates obtained from leaves, while triangles indicate isolates from fruits. The scale bar indicates 0.02 expected changes per site.
Figure 4: A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 41 isolates in the C. boninense species complex. The species C. gloeosporioides (IMI 356878) was used as an outgroup. The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS genes. Bayesian posterior probability (PP ≥ 0.90), MP bootstrap support values (ML ≥ 50%), and RAxML bootstrap support values (ML ≥ 50%) are displayed at the nodes (PP/MP/ML). Ex-type isolates are in bold. Colored blocks indicate clades containing isolates from Pyrus spp. in this study, and circles denote isolates obtained from leaves. The scale bar represents 0.04 expected changes per site.
The table lists various Colletotrichum species, along with their respective culture collection identifiers, and a series of scores indicating their genetic similarity or identification reliability.
Phylogenetic Analysis: A phylogenetic tree was generated using Bayesian inference based on concatenated sequences of genes: ACT, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB. Monilochaetes infuscans (CBS 869.96) served as an outgroup. Bayesian posterior probabilities (PP ≥ 0.90), maximum parsimony bootstrap support values (ML ≥ 50%), and RAxML bootstrap support values (ML ≥ 50%) are indicated at the nodes of the tree. Ex-type isolates are highlighted in bold. Colored blocks represent clades containing isolates from Pyrus spp.; circles denote isolates sourced from leaves. The scale bar illustrates 0.09 expected changes per site.
Recombination Tests: The results of pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) tests for closely related species were analyzed using LogDet transformation and splits decomposition. The tests revealed significant recombination levels within the dataset, particularly for species such as C. jinshuiense and C. pyrifoliae. A PHI test value (Φw) of less than 0.05 indicates significant recombination.
Pathogenicity Tests: To assess the potential for recombination affecting species delimitation in phylogenetic analyses, multi-locus datasets (ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS) underwent two PHI tests. The total sample consisted of 295 pear isolates associated with anthracnose, collected from 249 leaves and 46 fruits. The study noted no significant recombination events between the isolates of pear anthracnose.

Five isolates were chosen for further analyses based on their morphology (colony shape, color, and conidial morphology), ITS sequence data, symptom type, origin, and host cultivar. Taxonomy involved is detailed in Table 1. Based on morphology and multi-locus sequence data, the 90 isolates were assigned to 12 species of Colletotrichum. Among these, two species proved to represent new taxa, which are described below. The 90 representative isolates, together with 181 reference isolates from previously described species (as shown in Table 3), were subjected to multi-locus phylogenetic analyses using concatenated ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences for those belonging to the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes, or using concatenated ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences for other species lacking CAL sequences.
The results indicated that the isolates clustered together with 12 species across five Colletotrichum species complexes, including gloeosporioides (50 isolates), acutatum (15), boninense (14), dematium (5), and orchidearum (1), as well as one singleton species (5). In the phylogenetic tree constructed for the isolates in the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 50 isolates clustered into six clades corresponding to C. fructicola (14 isolates), C. aenigma (1 isolate), C. siamense (11), C. gloeosporioides (11), C. wuxiense (2), and C. conoides (1).
Regarding the isolates in the C. acutatum species complex, a total of 40 isolates were collected. Colletotrichum aenigma has been reported to cause anthracnose diseases on P. pyrifolia from Japan and on P. communis from Italy. This is the first report of C. aenigma causing anthracnose on P. bretschneideri and Pyrus in China.
In the C. boninense species complex, 13 isolates clustered with C. karstii, and one with C. citricola. For the remaining 11 isolates, one clustered with C. plurivorum, while five isolates formed a distinct clade as sister to Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC3.15172 in the C. dematium species complex. Additionally, the remaining five isolates, which formed a distinct clade, clustered distantly from any known Colletotrichum species complex.
Table 1 provides a summary of the characteristics used to select the five isolates for further analysis. It includes columns for morphology (describing colony shape and color), ITS sequence data, the type of symptoms observed, the origin of the isolates, and the host cultivar from which they were collected. Each row represents a specific isolate, detailing its unique attributes that contributed to its classification within the Colletotrichum species. This comprehensive overview serves to contextualize the selection criteria for the isolates studied.
C. citricola is responsible for causing anthracnose on P. pyrifolia. In the publication "Persoonia – Volume 42, 2019," ascospores from the isolate PAFQ13 measured between 13.5–20 × 5–8 μm, with a mean ± SD of 17.4 ± 1.4 × 7.1 ± 0.7 μm. These ascospores are slightly larger than those of the ex-type isolate CBS 134228, which measured 12.8–18.4 × 5.3–6.7 μm, with a mean of 15.8 × 6.1 μm for C. citricola. Setae observed in the acervuli formed on pear leaves were brown, smooth-walled, 2-septate, measuring 41–84 μm long, with a rounded base, 6 μm in diameter, and an acute tip.

All samples were produced on PDA agar medium. Scale bars are as follows: (c, l) = 500 μm; (d–g, k, m–q) = 20 μm; (h, i) = 10 μm; (j) = 100 μm.
Colletotrichum conoides Y.Z. Diao et al. was documented in Persoonia 38: 27. The asexual morph developed on PDA shows conidiophores that are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline, cylindrical to clavate, measuring 18–34.5 × 2–3 μm. Conidia are hyaline, with the sexual form developing from light morph to dark brown, measuring 77–180 × 69–159 μm, and are ovoid to obpyriform. Asci are aseptate, smooth-walled, cylindrical, with both ends round or slightly acute, measuring 59.5–99 × 13.5–18.5 μm, containing 8 spores. The ascospores measure 16–20 × 4.5–6 μm, with a mean ± SD of 18.4 ± 0.8 × 5.6 ± 0.3 μm, and an L/W ratio of 3.3. Appressoria are dark brown, irregular, often square to ellipsoidal in outline, measuring 7–12.5 × 5–8.5 μm, with a mean ± SD of 9.7 ± 1.3 × 6.9 ± 1.1 μm and an L/W ratio of 1.4.

Cuiguan); (i) conidia; (j, k) appressoria; (l) ascoma; (m, n) asci; (o) ascospores. All images are from isolate PAFQ13, with scale bars of (d) = 100 μm; (e–i, l–o) = 20 μm; (j, k) = 10 μm.
Figure 9 features Colletotrichum conoides, with (a, b) front and back views of a 6-day-old PDA culture; (c) conidiomata; (d) ascomata from a pear leaf (P. bretschneideri cv. Dangshansuli); (e) conidiophores; (f) conidia; (g–i) appressoria; (j) ascoma; (k) sectional view of an ascoma from a pear leaf (P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan); (l) neck of an ascoma; (m, n) asci. The isolates are from PAFQ6, with (a–n) being produced on PDA agar medium. Scale bars are (c, d) = 100 μm; (e, f, j–n) = 20 μm; (g–i) = 10 μm.
The culture characteristics on PDA show colonies that are flat with an entire margin, featuring dense, white, cottony aerial mycelium. The reverse side displays light grey in the center and pale white at the margin, with olivaceous pigments forming concentric rings. The colony diameter after 5 days is 77–78 mm, with conidia appearing in orange masses.
Materials examined include samples from China, specifically Hubei Province, Wuhan City, collected on fruits of P. pyrifolia on September 1, 2015, by M. Fu (culture PAFQ6). Notably, Colletotrichum conoides was first reported on Capsicum annuum (chili) from China (Diao et al., 2017). In this study, one isolate (PAFQ6) from pear fruit clustered with the ex-type culture of C. conoides (CGMCC 3.17615) in the multi-locus phylogenetic tree.
Conidia of the isolate PAFQ6 (16–20 × 4.5–6 μm, mean ± SD = 18.4 ± 0.8 × 5.6 ± 0.3 μm) are longer than those of the ex-type isolate CGMCC 3.17615 (13–17.5 × 5–6.5 µm, mean = 15.9 × 5.9 µm) of C. conoides.

Previously, anthracnose on various species of pear has been reported, including Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan (Weir et al. 2012), Citrus reticulata in China (Huang et al. 2013), and Pyrus bretschneideri in China (Li et al. 2013). Other studies (e.g., Lima et al. 2013, Liu et al. 2015) have also identified different species as responsible for anthracnose (Diao et al. 2017). The symptoms caused by this pathogen were identified by Cannon et al. (2008) and Liu et al. (2015) on P. pyrifolia leaves (Zhang et al. 2015) and on P. bretschneideri fruits in China (Jiang et al. 2014).

Colletotrichum jinshuiense M. Fu & G.P. Wang, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB824216.
Etymology: Referring to the host variety (P. pyrifolia cv. Jinshui) from which the fungus was isolated.
Notes: Although C. gloeosporioides has been identified as responsible for pear anthracnose in China, these identifications were chiefly based on morphology and/or ITS sequence data (Wu et al. 2010, Liu et al. 2013b). In this study, 20 isolates of C. gloeosporioides, isolated from fruits and leaves of pear, were identified based on multi-loci phylogenetic analyses and confirmed as the cause of pear anthracnose following Koch’s postulates.
Description & Illustration: The fungus shows acervular conidiomata on pear leaves and fruit. The conidiophores are pale brown to hyaline, simple to 2-septate, and unbranched. The conidial cells on the fruit surface are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 12.5–27 × 3.5–4.5 μm, with openings of 1–2 μm. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and curved, with dimensions on leaf surfaces of 25–29.5 × 3.5–4.5 μm (mean ± SD = 27.1 ± 1.7 × 4.0 ± 0.3 μm, L/W ratio = 6.8) and on fruit surfaces of 21–30.5 × 3–4.5 μm (mean ± SD = 24.4 ± 2.1 × 4.0 ± 0.3 μm, L/W ratio = 6.2). The appressoria are pale brown, smooth-walled, ellipsoidal to clavate, measuring 8–17 × 5–7.5 μm (mean ± SD = 10.7 ± 1.7 × 6.0 ± 0.5 μm, L/W ratio = 1.8).

CHINA, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, on leaves of Pyrus pyrifolia cv. Jinshui, 1 Aug. 2016, M. Fu (holotype HMAS 247824, culture ex-type CGMCC 3.18903 = PAFQ26); ibid., cultures PAFQ26a, PAFQ26b, PAFQ26c, and PAFQ26d.
Isolates of Colletotrichum jinshuiense are phylogenetically closely related to Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC 3.15172, which was reported as an endophytic Colletotrichum species from Bletilla ochracea (Orchidaceae) in China (Tao et al. 2013). They differ in GAPDH (94.98%) and TUB2 (98.12%). The PHI test (Φw = 1) did not detect recombination between these isolates and Colletotrichum sp. isolate CGMCC 3.15172. In this study, C. jinshuiense clustered in the C. dematium species complex, which is often associated with herbaceous plants (Damm et al. 2009). The asexual and sexual morphs of C. jinshuiense were not observed on PDA or SNA, while they developed easily on pear fruit and leaves, indicating that pear tissue plays an important role in the epidemiology and life cycle of C. jinshuiense.

M. Fu et al. report on Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose in Pyrus spp. This is the first report of C. plurivorum (CBS 125474) associated with anthracnose in P. bretschneideri. Notably, isolate PAFQ65 rapidly developed the sexual morph on PDA after 20–22 days, forming semi-immersed ascomata in the agar medium, which are pyriform to subglobose, dark brown, measuring 78–212 × 75–160 μm, with an ostiolate opening. The asci are fasciculate, clavate, measuring 66–92 × 11–20 μm and 8-spored. Ascospores are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical with rounded ends, straight, rarely slightly curved, granular in content, measuring 11.5–20.5 × 4.5–7 μm, with a mean ± SD of 16.8 ± 1.6 × 6.4 ± 0.5 μm.

Materials examined. CHINA, Hubei Province, Wuhan City, on leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Jinshui, 1 Aug. 2016, M. Fu (holotype HMAS 247825, culture ex-type CGMCC3.18902 = PAFQ22); ibid., PAFQ22a, PAFQ22b, PAFQ22c, and PAFQ22d.
Colletotrichum pyrifoliae has been reported to be associated with anthracnose in Rubus glaucus in Colombia (Afanador-Kafuri et al., 2014). However, C. pyrifoliae differs from other related species in its sequences: ACT (95.62% sequence identity), CHS-1 (96.47%), GAPDH (93.01%), ITS (99.25%), and TUB2 (96.41%). Moreover, isolates of C. pyrifoliae have larger conidia (PAFQ22, 14–23 × 5.5–7 µm, mean ± SD = 18.1 ± 1.8 × 6.4 ± 0.4 μm) compared to those of Colletotrichum sp. isolate Q026 (mean = 10.4 × 2.9 μm). The PHI test (Φw = 0.9862) detected no significant recombination between the isolates and Colletotrichum sp. isolate Q026 (Fig. 6b). Colletotrichum pyrifoliae is a singleton species and did not group with either the C. gloeosporioides or C. boninense species complexes (Fig. 5).
Colletotrichum siamense, as described by Prihastuti et al. (2009) in "Fungal Diversity 39," has been examined in various regions. In China, collections were made from Shandong Province, Yantai City, on fruits of P. communis cv. Gyuiot on 27 Aug. 2016 (cultures PAFQ67, PAFQ68, PAFQ71, PAFQ73, PAFQ74) and from Zhejiang Province, Hangzhou City, on leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Guanyangxueli on 18 Aug. 2016 (PAFQ78), and on leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan on the same date (PAFQ85). Notably, C. siamense was first reported on Coffea arabica in Thailand (Prihastuti et al., 2009) and has since been documented on a wide range of hosts (e.g., Yang et al., 2009; Wikee et al., 2011; Wei et al., 2012; Wang et al., 2016; Liu et al., 2016b). This study marks the first report and characterization of C. siamense causing anthracnose on P. pyrifolia and P. communis.
The isolates of C. siamense were classified into three morphological groups (I–III). Group I colonies (13 isolates, representative isolate PAFQ67) were flat, grey-green with a white margin; the reverse was dark green to black in the center with a pale white margin, exhibiting sporadic pigment at the margin. Group II colonies (25 isolates, representative isolate PAFQ74) were flat, surface white; the reverse was pale yellow in the center with a pale white margin, occasionally showing grey radial pigment. Group III colonies (1 isolate, representative isolate PAFQ78) were convex, pale white in the center with a white margin; the reverse was pale yellow in the center with a pale white margin, sometimes producing grey pigment.
Analyses of the prevalence of 12 Colletotrichum species revealed that C. fructicola was the most common, with 298 isolates (61.1% of total isolates), predominantly found in six provinces (Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang). It was followed by C. fioriniae (52 isolates, 10.7%), isolated from Anhui, Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Shandong; C. siamense (43 isolates, 8.8%), isolated from Shandong and Zhejiang; C. aenigma (40 isolates, 8.2%), isolated from Anhui, Hubei, Jiangsu, and Zhejiang; C. gloeosporioides (20 isolates, 4.1%), isolated from Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang; and C. karstii (19 isolates, 3.9%), isolated from Fujian, Hubei, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang. The remaining six species accounted for 3.2% of the isolates.
Setae were observed in isolates PAFQ78 and PAFQ74 on PDA; these setae were dark brown to black, opaque, with an acute tip and a cylindrical base, measuring 67–95 μm in length. C. fructicola emerged as the most dominant species on pear in China, while C. aenigma, C. fioriniae, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, and C. siamense were less dominant. C. citricola and C. conoides were also noted in this study.
Black spot symptoms were mainly detected in the sexual morph on SNA. Ascomata developed on SNA after 18 to 22 days, being immersed or semi-immersed in the agar medium. The ascomata were subglobose to pyriform, dark brown, measuring 88–249 × 88–224 μm, and ostiolate. The sexual morph exhibited a length-to-width ratio of approximately 3.4:1, with dimensions ranging from 6.5 to 7.4 μm.
In analyses conducted across the Yangtze Valley regions of Fujian, Hubei, Jiangsu, Jiangxi, and Zhejiang provinces, it was revealed that C. fructicola dominated the samples isolated, accounting for 85.2% in Fujian, 83.8% in Jiangsu, and 80.4% in Anhui. Ascospores were clavate, measuring 57–96 × 12–16 μm, 8-spored, hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, fusiform, and slightly curved. The mean size of ascospores was recorded at 18.37 ± 1.39 × 5.80 ± 0.44 μm, with a length-to-width ratio of 3.2.
The asexual morph developed on PDA. Vegetative hyphae were 1.5–4.5 μm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, with setae not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, while conidiogenous cells were cylindrical, measuring 8.5–28 × 2.5–4 μm. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with both ends rounded or one end slightly acute, measuring 11.5–17 × 4.5–6.5 μm, with a mean size of 14.9 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.3 μm and a length-to-width ratio of 2.8. Appressoria were dark brown, irregularly shaped or bullet-shaped with an acute tip, lobed, measuring 6.5–12 × 5.5–11 μm, with a mean size of 9.4 ± 1.1 × 7.1 ± 1.4 μm and a length-to-width ratio of 1.3.
Colonies on PDA were convex with an entire margin, dense aerial mycelium, greenish in the center with a white margin; the reverse was pale yellow with a white margin and a dark green concentric ring in the middle. The colony diameter was 70–71 mm after 5 days, with conidia in mass appearing orange.
Materials examined include samples from Jiangxi Province, Jinxi County, on leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan, collected on July 23, 2016, by M. Fu (cultures PAFQ53 and PAFQ54). The results from multi-locus phylogenetic analyses indicate that two isolates (PAFQ53, PAFQ54) were identified, showing distinct characteristics.
Isolation analyses of these Colletotrichum species from the sampled pear species revealed that C. fructicola isolates were dominant on P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri, accounting for 64.5% and 79.7% of the total isolates, respectively. Other species, including C. fioriniae (11.8%), C. aenigma (9.3%), C. karstii (4.9%), and C. gloeosporioides (4.6%), were also present in lower frequencies. Additionally, C. siamense and C. fioriniae were isolated from P. communis, with incidences of 95% and 5%, respectively. The remaining species (C. citricola, C. conoides, C. jinshuiense, C. pyrifoliae, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense) were isolated at a low incidence of less than 5.0% from P. pyrifolia.
Isolation from leaves and fruits revealed that C. aenigma, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. fioriniae, and C. siamense were found in both leaves and fruits. In contrast, C. citricola, C. jinshuiense, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, and C. pyrifoliae were isolated only from leaves, while C. conoides was isolated exclusively from fruits.
These measurements indicate that the conidia of C. wuxiense were smaller than those of the ex-type culture of C. wuxiense (CGMCC 3.17894), which measured 16.5–23 × 4.5–6.5 μm (mean ± SE = 19.0 ± 1.4 × 5.6 ± 0.5 μm). This is the first report of C. wuxiense causing anthracnose on P. pyrifolia and the first description of its sexual morphology. Under unwounded conditions, only C. fructicola (isolate PAFQ31) and C. siamense (isolate PAFQ78) were pathogenic, inducing lesions on the leaf tissues. Specifically, isolate PAFQ31 caused typical symptoms at 8 days post-inoculation (dpi) and isolate PAFQ78 caused extended symptoms at 14 dpi.

(b-d) The isolation rates (%) from each sampled province, from Pyrus spp., and from different pear organs, respectively.
Fig. 20 presents representative symptoms of pear leaves (P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan) induced by inoculation of spore suspensions of 12 Colletotrichum species under unwounded and wounded conditions. The symptoms were photographed at 14 dpi, except for specific images taken at 8 dpi. The inoculation involved dropping 1 × 10^6 spores (conidia or ascospores) per mL onto detached, about four-weeks-old leaves, with eight replicates. Each leaf was either wounded by pin-pricking with a sterilized needle (wounded) or kept unwounded. The inoculated positions on unwounded leaves are indicated with blue spots.
Table 5 summarizes the infection rates of Colletotrichum spp. inoculated on the leaves of P. pyrifolia cv. Cuiguan. It includes species, strain, origin, and infection rates, showing various levels of pathogenicity among different isolates.
Table 6 presents similar data but focuses on the infection rates of Colletotrichum spp. inoculated on the fruits of P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan, indicating a comparison between leaf and fruit infections.
Overall, at 14 dpi, all tested species were pathogenic to the leaves, although the infection rates varied significantly, from 2/16 for C. plurivorum (isolate PAFQ65) to 16/16 for C. fructicola (isolate PAFQ31). In cases of successful infection, lesions appeared at different rates and sizes, with C. fructicola inducing the largest lesions.
For C. citricola (isolate PAFQ13), small lesions quickly expanded into large dark brown to black lesions, with lesion lengths varying among the species (Fig. 20c1–c13). These lesions formed concentric rings of acervuli on the leaf tissues and exuded an orange conidia mass (6–10 dpi) at 25 °C under 99% relative humidity. It is worth mentioning that C. fructicola isolate PAFQ31, isolated from a leaf showing tip scorch (TS) symptoms in the field, induced similar symptoms around the brown necrotic leaf (BnL) on inoculated leaves (Fig. 20c2). In contrast, another C. fructicola isolate, PAFQ32, from a leaf showing BnL symptoms, induced only large black lesions (Fig. 20c3). Furthermore, C. conoides isolate PAFQ6, which was isolated only from pear fruits, also caused BnL symptoms on pear leaves (Fig. 20c7). No lesions were induced in the control fruits inoculated with sterile water.
Pathogenicity was also assessed on detached pear fruits of P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan. Under unwounded conditions, all isolates from the fruits were pathogenic at 30 dpi, with infection rates ranging from 2/6 for C. fioriniae (PAFQ19) to 5/6 for C. gloeosporioides (PAFQ61). These isolates began to induce small brown or dark brown lesions at different time points post-inoculation: 28–30 dpi for C. aenigma, C. conoides, and C. fioriniae; 18–22 dpi for C. gloeosporioides; and 6–8 dpi for C. siamense. Over time, the small lesions expanded into larger brown or dark brown lesions and formed concentric rings of acervuli at 4–6 dpi, which exuded an orange conidium mass (Fig. 21b1, b4–b6, b8).
For the isolates from pear leaves, only C. fructicola isolates (PAFQ31 and PAFQ32) were pathogenic to the inoculated fruits, with infection rates of 6/6 for isolate PAFQ31 and 5/6 for isolate PAFQ32 (Table 6). Notably, C. fructicola isolates PAFQ31 and PAFQ32 induced black spots (Fig. 21b2) and fruit rot symptoms (Fig. 21b3) at 30 dpi, similar to those observed on the leaves. This study revealed 12 species belonging to five Colletotrichum species complexes, including C. aenigma, C. conoides, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense, along with other species, confirming the involvement of C. conoides, C. siamense, C. wuxiense, C. citricola, C. karstii, and C. plurivorum in pear anthracnose for the first time. Importantly, this research differentiated two new species responsible for pear anthracnose: C. jinshuiense and C. pyrifoliae.
Corresponding to the taxonomic classification determined by multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, most Colletotrichum species exhibited characteristic morphological features, including colony colors, the density of aerial mycelium, and the shapes and sizes of conidia, ascospores, appressoria, and setae (Fig. 7–18). These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017). Notably, the Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose produced pigments that varied in color among species and isolates. Additionally, these species differed in their ability to form a sexual morph in culture.
At 10 days post-inoculation (dpi), there was varying aggressiveness among the setae produced on the host tissues by different species of Colletotrichum, particularly C. aenigma (see Figures 21c1–c13 and 22). The isolates of C. siamense showed growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA). Notably, the macro- and micro-morphologies of the Colletotrichum species isolated exhibited significant differences.
Figure 21 illustrates the symptoms on pear fruits (Pyrus bretschneideri cv. Huangguan) induced by inoculation with spore suspensions of 12 Colletotrichum species under both unwounded and wounded conditions. The photographs of unwounded conditions were taken at 30 dpi, while those of wounded conditions were taken at 10 dpi. Panels A and B depict symptoms from isolates/species belonging to the C. gloeosporioides complex and other complexes or singleton species, respectively. Inoculation involved applying 1 × 10^6 spores (conidia or ascospores) per mL to detached fruits, with triplicate samples for each treatment. Wounding was achieved by pin-pricking each position three times with a sterilized needle. Unwounded inoculation points were marked with blue spots.
Differences in symptom development were observed among isolates from pear, particularly those from P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri. Most C. gloeosporioides isolates from pear had longer conidia (15.5–32 μm) compared to those from tea (11–15.5 μm) and citrus (11.3–14.7 μm). Geographical preference was also noted, as C. siamense was more frequently isolated in certain areas, particularly Shandong province, whereas C. aenigma and C. fioriniae were mainly found in Hubei province. Furthermore, C. jinshuiense, C. pyrifoliae, C. wuxiense, C. plurivorum, C. conoides, and C. citricola exhibited low prevalence and restricted distribution.
A high species diversity associated with pear anthracnose was recorded in the Hubei province compared to Fujian and Shandong provinces. Interestingly, species such as C. acutatum and C. salicis were not detected in this study, despite their association with pear anthracnose in New Zealand.
Figure 22 presents lesion lengths and depths on wounded pear fruits (P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan) at 10 dpi, induced by conidial suspensions from 13 representative isolates of 12 Colletotrichum species. The isolates and their respective classifications are indicated at the bottom of the bars. Data were analyzed using SPSS Statistics 21.0, applying one-way analysis of variance and comparing means with Duncan’s test at a significance level of P = 0.05. The letters over the error bars indicate significant differences at this level.
Previous reports indicated that the pathogenicity of most identified Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose—including C. aenigma, C. fructicola, C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. pyricola, and C. salicis—showed no pathogenicity to pear fruits (P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan) under unwounded conditions up to 30 dpi. These findings reveal a clear organ specificity regarding the pathogenicity of some isolates.
To clarify their pathogenicity, it was revealed from the data that Colletotrichum acutatum species are host organ-specific; they primarily infect leaves instead of causing bitter rot on apple and pear fruit (Yano et al. 2004, González et al. 2006, Tashiro et al. 2012). Notably, C. fructicola caused tip burn (TS) symptoms on leaves and fruits under unwounded conditions, while it caused rot symptoms on fruits or necrotic lesions on leaves under wounded conditions. The symptoms of bacterial necrosis (BnL) on leaves could also be induced by C. fructicola isolates if these isolates were isolated from leaves showing BnL symptoms, indicating that C. fructicola has two pathogenic types. Previous studies have shown that C. fructicola caused anthracnose on many plants, such as Citrus reticulata (Huang et al. 2013), Capsicum spp. (Diao et al. 2017), Camellia sinensis (Liu et al. 2015), Mangifera indica (Lima et al. 2013), and Malus spp. (Munir et al. 2016), resulting in lesions rather than TS symptoms.
Interestingly, C. fructicola causes TS symptoms on pear. Colletotrichum aenigma has been reported on Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan (Weir et al. 2012) and P. communis in Italy (Schena et al. 2014) without mentioning the infected organs or induced symptoms. This is the first report of C. aenigma causing pear anthracnose on P. bretschneideri (on fruits and leaves) and P. pyrifolia (on leaves) in China (Fig. 19c, d), with a dominant incidence on the latter. Colletotrichum fioriniae was reported to cause leaf spots on Cinnamomum subavenium and Juglans regia in China (Sun et al. 2012, Zhu et al. 2015), as well as on Salvia leucantha in Italy (Garibaldi et al. 2016) and bitter rot on Pyrus spp. in the USA and Croatia (Damm et al. 2012b, Ivic et al. 2013), and P. communis in France (Da Lio et al. 2017). This is the first report of C. fioriniae in China, which caused pear bitter rot and was associated with pear leaf spots on P. pyrifolia, P. bretschneideri, and P. communis.
Colletotrichum citricola was first reported on Citrus unchiu in China, where it was a saprobe on leaves (Huang et al. 2013), but this is the first report of C. citricola on P. pyrifolia, where it was found to cause anthracnose on pear leaves. Previous results indicated that wounding can break the quiescent infection and enhance the infectivity of C. fructicola, leading to more rapid rot of young and mature fruits (Jiang et al. 2014). It is worth noting that although the 12 species obtained in this study can infect pear fruits under wounded conditions, they exhibit different pathogenic behaviors.
This document discusses the ecological, molecular, and biological characterization of various Colletotrichum species associated with Pyrus plants. It presents the first reports of Colletotrichum citricola, C. conoides, C. karstii, C. plurivorum, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense, along with a novel species responsible for causing anthracnose on pear.
The study highlights the taxonomic, morphological, and biological diversity of Colletotrichum spp. related to different Pyrus spp. in China, taking into account tissue type, geographical location, and climate. This research contributes valuable information for understanding the ecology of the Colletotrichum genus.

Studies in filamentous ascomycetes have contributed significantly to mycology. In "Mycologia," Kanchana-udomkan et al. (2004) developed a bioassay to study anthracnose infection caused by Colletotrichum capsici in Capsicum chinense Jacq. Choi et al. (1999) focused on single spore isolation of fungi. Crous et al. (2009) compiled important findings in "Fungal Biodiversity," published in the CBS Laboratory Manual Series by the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures, Utrecht, Netherlands.
Katoh and Standley (2013) introduced improvements in MAFFT multiple sequence alignment software (version 7), enhancing performance and usability for molecular biology research (Molecular Biology and Evolution 30: 772–780). Da Lio et al. (2017) reported the first occurrence of pear bitter rot caused by Colletotrichum fioriniae in France (Plant Disease 101: 1319).
Damm et al. (2013) described the Colletotrichum orbiculare species complex, which includes significant pathogens of field crops and weeds. Further studies by Damm et al. (2012) and Li et al. (2013) explored the Colletotrichum boninense and Colletotrichum fructicola species complexes, respectively, with Li et al. identifying the latter as responsible for bitter rot of pear in China (Plant Disease 97: 1000).
Lima et al. (2013) identified five Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose in northeastern Brazil (Fungal Diversity 61: 75–88). Damm et al. (2014) investigated the Colletotrichum destructivum species complex, while Lin et al. (2002) conducted genetic analyses on resistance to pepper anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum capsici.
Further insights into the diversity of Colletotrichum species and their implications for plant biosecurity were presented by De Silva et al. (2017). Dean et al. (2012) highlighted the top ten fungal pathogens in molecular plant pathology, underscoring their significance.
Diao et al. (2017) documented Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili peppers in China, while Douanla-Meli et al. (2018) conducted a multi-approach analysis of the diversity within Colletotrichum cliviae sensu lato.
