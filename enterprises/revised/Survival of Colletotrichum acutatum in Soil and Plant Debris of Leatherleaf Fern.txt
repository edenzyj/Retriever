Leatherleaf fern anthracnose is caused by a new pathotype of Colletotrichum acutatum. This disease first appeared in Florida in 1993, spreading rapidly and causing losses that approach 100% in some ferneries. To inform control and management strategies for fern anthracnose, the survival of the pathogen in soil, diseased plant material, and on clothing was studied through laboratory and field experiments.
The survival of conidia and sclerotia in infected leaf debris was examined in soil maintained at five different moisture levels. Survival of conidia and sclerotia declined rapidly in moist conditions (≥12% moisture, vol/wt), while under dry conditions, viable conidia were detectable for up to 12 months after being incorporated into the soil. Similar findings were observed in field experiments where infected leaf debris was buried. Viable conidia were recovered for up to 3 months from leaf debris stored in laboratory conditions. Additionally, conidia applied to denim fabric were recoverable for up to 5 weeks post-application, indicating that contaminated clothing can effectively transport conidia within and between ferneries.
Inoculation experiments demonstrated that at least 100 conidia per ml are required to infect and colonize leatherleaf fern leaves. This threshold provides an estimate of conidia population levels likely to result in disease and indicates the levels sanitation or cultural practices must exceed for effective management.
Leatherleaf fern (Rumohra adiantiformis (G. Forster) Ching) is the largest cut foliage crop in the United States, with an estimated wholesale value of $70 million in 1993. Its fronds are used in floral arrangements, with about 25% exported to Europe and Japan. Approximately 2,860 hectares of leatherleaf fern are cultivated in Florida, with smaller amounts grown in California, Hawaii, Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas. Leatherleaf fern is a perennial crop, cultivated throughout the year, typically under 73% shade cloth or oak trees.
Fungal diseases caused by Cylindrocladium, Pythium, and Rhizoctonia spp. can also affect leatherleaf fern. However, fungicides can control these diseases and minimize losses. The new disease of leatherleaf fern (fern anthracnose) first emerged in 1993. By December 1994, five counties in Florida had reported the pathogen's presence in their ferneries, with estimates suggesting that one-half of the land in leatherleaf fern production has been infested.

This study has been completed on the ecology of Colletotrichum acutatum and its relationship to leatherleaf fern. Our research was undertaken to determine the potential for survival of C. acutatum in soil and plant debris within leatherleaf ferneries, as well as the ability of surviving inoculum to incite disease.
Accepted for publication: 11 July 1997.
Infectivity Tests: We determined the number of conidia necessary for infection and disease development on leatherleaf fern by spraying various concentrations of conidia on leatherleaf fern leaves. Conidia were harvested from cultures after 72 hours of growth on potato dextrose agar (PDA) under Gro-Lux fluorescent light (Sylvania Inc., Danvers, MA) with a 12-hour day/night cycle at 24°C. The conidia were diluted in sterile distilled water (SDW) to a concentration of 1 × 10⁷ conidia per ml and were serially diluted for inoculations. Ten plants were inoculated with each dilution, while a treatment with SDW served as a control. The inoculum was applied using a hand-held sprayer to fern plants growing in 450-cm³ pots, ensuring the leaves were sprayed to runoff. The plants were then placed in plastic bags for 24 hours to maintain high humidity and were arranged in randomized complete blocks within a glasshouse. After two weeks, the plants were evaluated for disease development, and the presence and reproduction of C. acutatum were confirmed. This experiment was repeated two additional times, and the results were averaged.
Semiselective Medium: Naturally occurring populations of fungi and bacteria in soil complicate studies of specific organisms found in low numbers. To develop a semiselective medium suitable for both controlled environments and field samples, a selective marker was necessary. The fungicide benomyl, previously used extensively in leatherleaf fern production, did not control fern anthracnose; thus, C. acutatum was expected to be tolerant to it. Induced resistance to benomyl is believed to arise from a single gene mutation and is easily induced and stable. However, some consider the resistance of C. acutatum to benomyl to be natural rather than the result of selection pressure. Benomyl has been included in semiselective media developed in other studies for the isolation of Colletotrichum spp. from soil.
The tolerance of C. acutatum isolates from leatherleaf fern to benomyl was evaluated based on radial growth of fungal colonies and conidial germination on benomyl-amended PDA. The radial growth of four isolates from different ferneries was measured on PDA and PDA amended with 5, 50, 100, 500, and 1,000 µg of benomyl (Benlate WP, 50 a.i.) per ml. Three plugs from a 2-day-old culture growing on PDA were removed with a 4-mm cork borer and placed equidistantly on 9-cm-diameter petri plates containing 20 ml of media; two replicate plates were used for each treatment. The plates were incubated under Gro-Lux fluorescent lights with a 12-hour day/night cycle. Radial growth of the six colonies in each treatment was measured daily for 5 days. Treatment means were compared using Tukey’s least significant difference (LSD) test.
Survival in Leaf Debris: Survival of C. acutatum in leaf debris was examined in 1-g portions of chopped, infected leatherleaf fronds placed in plastic Magenta vessels. Three replicate vessels were prepared for this analysis.
To study the survival of sclerotia in soil, 1-g soil subsamples were removed at weekly intervals for 8 weeks. We spread 0.5 ml of a conidial suspension (1 × 10^6 conidia per ml) on 9-cm-diameter acidified PDA plates (PDA supplemented with lactic acid at 0.25 ml/liter). After 20 hours, 300 conidia were examined under magnification to determine the percentage of germination. This experiment was repeated three times, and means were compared using Tukey’s LSD test. Based on observable inhibition of competitive soil fungi, a concentration of 50 µg of benomyl per ml was selected for all subsequent soil assays and field work. Chlortetracycline (100 µg/ml) was added to limit bacterial growth.
When C. acutatum was grown on this semiselective medium under fluorescent lights, colonies turned a bright salmon orange and were easily identifiable. To confirm that colonies observed on selective media were indeed C. acutatum and that they maintained pathogenicity, 10 colonies (2 from each soil moisture treatment) were selected from subsamples taken 29 weeks after incorporating the spore suspension. The cultures were incubated as described previously, and after 72 hours of growth, salmon-orange colonies were counted.
The contents of 18 observable plates were ground in a blender with 300 ml of sterile distilled water (SDW). The agar-fungal mixture was rinsed through soil sieves with 250- and 90-µm openings. Sclerotia trapped in the smaller sieve were repeatedly washed with distilled water until no conidia could be observed in the rinsate under microscopic examination. Sclerotia were then centrifuged at 5,000 rpm (9,000 × g) for 10 minutes, and the liquid-agar was collected for further analysis.

Study Overview: This study examined the survival and infectivity of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia in various conditions. Instruments connected to a data logger monitored soil moisture at a depth of 3 cm. Infected fern fronds were chopped and placed in nylon mesh bags buried 3 cm deep in shade structures. Bags were retrieved weekly for four weeks and then every three weeks until C. acutatum could no longer be detected.
The results indicated that viable conidia could be recovered for up to 12 months under dry soil conditions (1%). Conidia associated with leaf debris maintained viability at levels above 100 conidia per gram for 31 weeks. When leaf debris was added to soil and incubated in controlled environments, concentrations of detectable conidia increased in the first week but eventually declined over time. Notably, long-term survival of C. acutatum in leaf debris buried outdoors mirrored that of conidia incorporated into soil.
To assess survival on clothing, a spore suspension of 1 × 10^6 conidia per ml was sprayed onto denim fabric, which was then air-dried and cut into 1-cm² sections. The sections were stored at 25°C, and weekly evaluations showed the number of surviving spores decreased over time. Infectivity tests revealed that at inoculum levels of at least 1 × 10^6 conidia per ml, all inoculated fern plants exhibited symptoms within seven days. A linear decrease in disease incidence occurred at lower inoculum concentrations, with no infections detected below 100 conidia per ml.
Colletotrichum acutatum isolates were tested for radial growth on diseased leaf debris maintained in the laboratory. The growth on benomyl-amended Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) was significantly lower (P = 0.05) than growth on standard PDA over a 56-day period, with the temperature maintained at 25°C. All colonies grew and sporulated; however, no significant differences in growth were observed among the five levels of benomyl tested. After 5 days, the colony diameter in the presence of benomyl decreased by 63% (4.19 ± 0.42 mm) compared to growth on PDA (11.31 ± 0.36 mm). No significant differences in conidia germination were noted between PDA and benomyl-amended PDA (1,000 µg/ml), with both showing a germination rate of 99.50 ± 0.62% and 99.50 ± 0.43%, respectively.
Survival of C. acutatum in Soil and Leaf Debris: Populations of C. acutatum conidia recovered from laboratory soil tests decreased steadily, especially under moist or saturated conditions. Within 1 week, detectable populations decreased by more than 30% across all treatments. By 4 weeks, the number of viable conidia fell below 100 conidia per gram of soil when soil moisture was above 6%. In contrast, under dry conditions (1% moisture), it took 105 days for populations to fall below 100 conidia per gram of soil.
Sclerotia of C. acutatum added to soil under laboratory conditions maintained high viability (≥ 100 sclerotia per gram of soil) under dry conditions for 26 weeks; however, under moist conditions (≥ 12% moisture), populations declined to very low levels by day 56. Viable sclerotia were consistently recovered from the soil for up to 47 weeks after incorporation.
Survival of C. acutatum on Clothing: The number of viable conidia recovered from denim fabric held at 25°C and low humidity decreased at a steady rate. Sufficient numbers of conidia to cause infection (100 CFU/ml) were recovered for up to 4 weeks after placement on the fabric, although some viable conidia were still recovered for up to 42 days post-treatment.
Eastburn and Gubler (1990) monitored the survival of Colletotrichum acutatum in strawberry tissue over a 7-week period at three temperatures (11°C, 25°C, and 40°C) and three soil moisture conditions (flooded, moist at 10.6%, and air dry). Recovery of C. acutatum from infected tissue declined rapidly under flooded soil conditions at soil temperatures of 25°C or higher. In contrast, recovery from tissue samples was 100% after 7 weeks at both 10°C and 25°C. Similar results were observed in our study regarding the survival of conidia and sclerotia in infected leatherleaf fern debris under varying soil moisture levels.
Fern harvesting occurs throughout the year and in all weather conditions, including rain. Harvesters are contracted to work in various ferneries and may harvest from multiple fields and farms within the same day. The transport of conidia on clothing, tools, and equipment is believed to be a major mechanism by which the fungus spreads rapidly within and between ferneries. Wet clothing can easily absorb hydrophilic spores that are later transferred to the surfaces of susceptible leaves. Our results demonstrate that conidia can persist on clothing for periods that create a significant potential for long-distance transport and introduction into uninfested ferneries.
