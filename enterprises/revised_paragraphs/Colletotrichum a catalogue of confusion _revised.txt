Identification of Colletotrichum species has long been difficult due to limited morphological characters. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have also not proven very successful in delineating species. This may be partly due to the high level of erroneous names in GenBank. In this paper, we review the problems associated with the taxonomy of Colletotrichum and the difficulties in identifying taxa to species. We advocate for epitypification and the use of multi-locus phylogeny to delimit species and gain a better understanding of the genus. We review the lifestyles of Colletotrichum species, which may occur as epiphytes, endophytes, saprobes, and pathogens. It is unclear in most cases whether taxa isolated from these different life modes are the same species or different morphologically similar species; in most cases, identification has been based on morphology and may not be accurate. We use three selected species, C. dematium, C. destructivum, and C. fragariae, to highlight the problems associated with species identification and the issues that may arise when incorrect names are applied to species. We also review the clinical aspects of the genus and the use of Colletotrichum species in biotransformations. In most examples, the need for correct identification, which can be achieved by comparison with types and molecular data, is emphasized. We propose the need for agreement on protocols to address the description and naming of Colletotrichum species and make predictions for the next five years. The reviews illustrate the importance of correctly identifying strains before the commencement of scholarly research.

Colletotrichum has continued to rank highly as one of the most studied genera of phytopathogenic fungi. Latunde-Dada (2001) concluded that Colletotrichum, based on the number of citations recorded in the Web of Science from 1981 to March 2001, is rated alongside Botrytis, Puccinia, and Verticillium, being surpassed only by Fusarium, Phytophthora, and Rhizoctonia in phytopathogenic publications. The objective of this paper on Colletotrichum is to: 1) review the problems in taxonomy and the difficulties of identifying taxa to species, 2) review the relationships and lifestyles, 3) review clinical aspects, and 4) review industrial uses such as biotransformations. In all cases, we discuss the potential problems associated with misidentification of taxa. Extensive research by numerous scientists has been conducted on Colletotrichum dematium, C. destructivum, and C. fragariae, and this data is reviewed to illustrate the importance of accurately identifying strains before commencing scholarly research.
Identification within the genus Colletotrichum is complicated due to species having few distinguishing morphological characters and the rarity of teleomorphic stages (Hyde et al., 2009). Some taxa have uncertain or extensive host relationships and exhibit considerable morphological variability in culture (Simmonds, 1965; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008). TeBeest et al. (1997) concluded that taxonomic uncertainty has hindered accurate identification, complicating efforts to understand host relationships, diagnose diseases accurately, develop effective control strategies, and establish cost-effective quarantine programs. Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characters; several features have been utilized by taxonomists, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph state, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always adequate for reliable differentiation among Colleto
C. musae, C. gloeosporioides group 1, C. gloeosporioides group 2, C. gloeosporioides group 3, and C. truncatum. Whitelaw-Weckert et al. (2007) proposed a new C. acutatum group, which is now included in C. simmondsii (Shivas and Tan, 2009), based on cultural, morphological, RAPD-PCR, and sequencing of parts of the rDNA-ITS regions and the β-tubulin gene. Than et al. (2008b) differentiated the isolates of chilli anthracnose from Thailand into three species: C. acutatum, C. capsici, and C. gloeosporioides (but see page 3), based on morphological characterization, sequencing of the rDNA-ITS and β-tubulin genes, and pathogenicity testing. Thus, accurate identification of Colletotrichum species can be achieved by combining multigene analysis and morphological characters. Once a species is accurately named, it unlocks data that can be used for developing and implementing effective disease control strategies (Freeman et al., 1993) and other research.
One of the problems with the accurate identification of Colletotrichum species using multigene analysis or barcoding is that many existing sequences in GenBank are incorrectly named. Crouch et al. (2009a) revealed a high frequency of misidentification (86%) based on rDNA-ITS sequence similarity comparison in GenBank within the C. graminicola species complex. Cai et al. (2009) analyzed 343 rDNA-ITS sequences of C. gloeosporioides in GenBank (accessed September 6, 2009) and found that an astounding 86% of these sequences show considerable evolutionary divergence from the epitype of C. gloeosporioides and most likely represent other species. These high error rates show that accurate identification of Colletotrichum species using rDNA-ITS sequence data presently lodged in GenBank is impossible.
How can this situation be rectified? Isolates that represent the types of species are needed. Published new species must have ex-type living strains deposited in easily accessible culture c
In many cases, the same species have been recorded with several lifestyles, although due to the ambiguity of species identification, it is not always clear whether they are definitely the same species. The question of how and whether taxa change their lifestyle from non-pathogenic to pathogenic still needs to be addressed and remains an important unanswered question in the study of Colletotrichum. Full descriptions of the lifestyles for each Colletotrichum species, linked with molecular data for accurate taxon identification, are needed to explore, understand, and develop effective control strategies within the genus. In one such study, Prihastuti et al. (2009) described C. fructicola and C. siamense from coffee berries, isolated as epiphytes, endophytes, and pathogens. These species have since been shown to be widespread on several hosts (Yang et al., 2009). Colletotrichum dematium also occurs as an endophyte, pathogen, and saprobe (Damm et al., 2009). The significance of these findings may have great importance as evidence grows that these species of Colletotrichum are ubiquitous and widespread.
Colletotrichum as plant pathogens and agents of post-harvest disease:
Colletotrichum is one of the most economically important genera of fungi, causing anthracnose disease, which affects a wide host range, especially on tropical and subtropical crops as well as fruit trees (Sutton, 1992). Above-ground plant parts can be affected by Colletotrichum diseases at all stages, including stems, leaves, flowers, and fruits. An example of Colletotrichum anthracnose familiar to many is the blackening of tropical fruits (Tang et al., 2005), especially bananas and mangoes in fruit bowls. Crouch and Beirn (2009) reviewed the graminicol
Guyana. Hyde and Soytong (2008) discussed the role of endophytes that can become primary saprobic decomposers or latent infections of pathogens that cause disease under specific conditions. Simmonds (1941) showed in field experiments that Gloeosporium musarum (= C. musae) can remain latent within the skin of green banana fruits for almost five months and develop anthracnose fruit rot as the fruit ripens. The development of the fungus in the latent phase is restricted due to a poor capacity for secreting macerating enzymes and pectinase (Simmonds, 1963). Quiescent infections of strawberry transplants by C. gloeosporioides are common and play an important role as inoculum sources of anthracnose crown rot (Raman and Louws, 2008). Wright (1998) studied Colletotrichum infection of Citrus and isolated Colletotrichum as endophytes from growing stems over an entire season. She consistently isolated C. gloeosporioides, which appeared to grow into new stem tissues and eventually into the flowers, infecting them at fruit set (Wright et al., 1996, 1997; Wright, 1998). Pathogenicity testing also showed that the endophytic strains of C. gloeosporioides caused disease in oranges, and Wright (1998) speculated that the endophytes grow into the albedo of oranges and remain dormant until a period of post-harvest storage triggers the fungus to become active and cause stem end fruit rot (Wright et al., 1996, 1997). The strain was not compared with the epitype, which was unavailable at the time, but it is likely to be C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto, as the epitype is from oranges.
Colletotrichum as saprobes. Colletotrichum species are rarely recorded in studies concerning saprobes on various hosts (e.g., pine needles, Zamora et al., 2008; Castanopsis diversifolia leaves, Duong et al., 2008; Magnoliaceae wood, Kodsueb et al., 2008), although Photita et al. (2001a, 2003) have recorded C. gloeosporioides as a saprobe on banana (Musa sp.), and Osono et al. (2009) recorded C. gloeosporioides on decaying leaves of Shorea obtusa. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and another Colletotrichum species have also been recorded on dead leaves of Dracaena lourieri (Thongkantha et al., 2008). It appears that Colletotrichum species survive and compete poorly as saprotrophs. In the
Colletotrichum dematium (Pers.) Grove has recently gained attention as a species in urgent need of epitypification. Originally collected from a stem of Eryngium in France and various solanaceous hosts, it has been recorded as a pathogen of chilli and numerous other hosts, including Polygonatum falcatum and as an endophyte of Pteromiscum sp. Disease symptoms associated with this pathogen range from fruit rot to shoot, leaf, and flower blight. Notably, Sutton (1980) documented 216 collections from 37 countries on 118 different host genera. Many of these putative hosts are commercially important plants, such as tomato, mulberry, soybean, and beech. Symptoms on mulberry leaves present as brown necrotic spots or streaks, while tomato anthracnose results in greyish, sunken, water-soaked lesions that later turn tan with small black specks. On beech, C. dematium has been implicated in post-emergence damping-off of current-year seedlings. Pathogenicity studies have confirmed that putative strains of C. dematium are pathogenic to various hosts, including mulberry and beech seedlings.
C. dematium is challenging to identify based on morphological characteristics due to discrepancies in conidia width reported by different researchers. Colonies of putative C. dematium strains can be quite variable, exhibiting white to pale mouse-grey or grey-vinaceous patches with abundant setae and black, conical sclerotia. The conidia are typically formed in olive-grey to light vinaceous-salmon masses, measuring 18–26 × 2–3 µm, and are falcate or fusiform, tapering at both ends. Appressoria are medium brown, clavate, ovate, or irregular in shape, with entire or slightly lobed margins. Previous studies have reported variations in spore sizes, and while some isolates closely resemble C. dematium, it has been determined that further clarification is necessary due to the lack of epitypification.
The importance of epitypification is underscored in recent works, highlighting how it stabilizes names and facilitates comparisons across various studies. Damm et al. (2009) contributed to this effort by epitypifying C. dematium, providing conidial sizes that reflect the species' variability. Additionally, a study by Yang et al. (2009) revealed differences that led to the classification of a putative strain as C. spaethianum, demonstrating the critical role of accurate taxonomy
Colletotrichum species. Only a small number of strains were included in the species concept, and many strains previously reported as C. dematium sensu lato were shown to represent other species, including C. circinans, C. dematium, C. lilii, C. lineola, C. liriopes, C. spaethianum, C. spinaciae, C. tofieldiae, C. trichellum, C. truncatum, and two unidentified species. This outcome has significant phytopathological implications. Although only a few strains were classified as C. dematium sensu stricto, these strains indicate a wide host range and occur as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Damm et al., 2009).
Colletotrichum destructivum O’Gara was described from red clover (Fabaceae) by O'Gara (1915) and has been confused with several species, including C. gloeosporioides, C. lindemuthianum, and C. truncatum. In reviewing the genus, von Arx (1957) maintained C. destructivum as a distinct species, a classification upheld in von Arx (1970). Sutton (1980) did not consider C. destructivum an acceptable species, likely viewing it as a synonym of Glomerella cingulata. Manandahar et al. (1986) provided a detailed description of the morphology and pathogenicity of G. glycines and first established the connection between C. destructivum and G. glycines. The size of appressoria and length of conidia in C. destructivum are similar to those in C. lindemuthianum; however, they can be differentiated by cultural characteristics, conidia width, and their respective teleomorphs (Manandahar et al., 1986). More recently, due to morphological similarities of conidia and appressoria, the infection process, and rDNA-ITS sequence data, C. higginsianum was proposed as a synonym of C. destructivum (O’Connell et al., 2004).
Sun and Zhang (2009) isolated putative C. destructivum strains from cowpea and found that their morphological traits (e.g., colony structure, conidia, and appressoria) were similar to those of C. destructivum (sensu Sutton, 1992). Their infection process and intracellular infection structures on cowpea also aligned with those of C. destructivum on other hosts (Bailey et al., 1990; Latunde-Dada et al., 1997; Shen et al., 2001). However, cowpea isolates with rDNA-ITS sequences identical to those of C. higginsianum from cruciferous hosts could infect and complete the asexual cycle on Arabidopsis thaliana. The infection process indicated that in the initial biotrophic phase, intracellular primary hyphae were restricted to one epidermal cell, while in the subsequent necrotrophic phase, secondary hyphae invaded neighboring cells, mirroring the behavior of C. higginsianum from cruciferous plants (O’Connell et al., 2004). This suggests that the host range or the use of cruciferous hosts are not reliable criteria for distinguishing between the two species. Consequently,
Appressoria produced from the germinated conidia on hydrophobic polystyrene. An infection vesicle (arrow) and primary hyphae (PH) in tissue of Vigna unguiculata cv. qiudou were observed 72 hours after inoculation. Notably, an appressorium (A) produces an infection peg that invades a host epidermal cell, forming a globose infection vesicle (indicated by an arrow) and developing branched primary hyphae (PH). Bars represent 10 μm.
The preceding discussion highlights the ongoing confusion surrounding the status of Colletotrichum destructivum and its closely related species, which remains unresolved. Numerous Colletotrichum species have been identified on legumes, primarily from crops in temperate regions. Colletotrichum destructivum is known to cause anthracnose disease in lucerne, leading to significant yield losses in Europe, North America, northern Africa, and South Africa. In complex infections with other species such as C. coccodes, C. dematium, C. truncatum, and C. trifolii, it is regarded as a secondary pathogen. The host range of C. destructivum is extensive, encompassing legumes like Glycine max, Leucaena leucocephala, Lotus spp., Melilotus albus, Phaseolus lathyroides, Trifolium spp., Vigna unguiculata, Coronilla varia, as well as tobacco, dodder, and Arabidopsis thaliana, though these records require confirmation with sequence data. Host specificity has also been noted among C. destructivum isolates.
The infection processes and intracellular infection structures of strains designated as C. destructivum are well understood, exhibiting similar structures in cowpea, alfalfa, and tobacco. Other species, including C. truncatum and C. linicola, also share comparable infection processes and structures. Much of the confusion stems from the lack of epitypification of C. destructivum, as no types are available for sequence data comparison. Thus, epitypification is urgently needed to verify the strains named “destructivum” against the epitype and to confirm whether the strains from cowpea in infection process studies are accurately identified.
Colletotrichum fragariae, which causes anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria ananassa), is attributed to three potential Colletotrichum species: C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides. C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides are known for their wide host range, while C. fragariae is restricted to strawberry plants. These species are often confused due to the similar sympt
Arx (1957) placed C. fragariae in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides, but researchers have generally retained the use of the name C. fragariae when dealing with the pathogen on strawberries (Howard and Albregts, 1984; Mass and Howard, 1985; Sutton, 1992). Gunnell and Gubler (1992) reported that C. fragariae could be clearly distinguished from C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides by its morphology on strawberry leaf agar. Delimitation of these species remains problematic because literature references to C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides may actually refer to other species (Shivas and Tan, 2009; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1994). Several molecular studies have attempted to resolve the relationships of C. fragariae and other species from strawberry, but the results to date are inconclusive. The techniques include analysis of zymograms (Bonde et al., 1991), mitochondrial DNA restriction fragment length polymorphisms (mtDNA RFLPs) (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1992; Freeman et al., 1993), arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reactions (AP-PCR) (Freeman and Rodriguez, 1995; Freeman and Katan, 1997), random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) (Martínez-Culebra et al., 2002), and ribosomal DNA (rDNA) restriction analyses (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1992, 1994). Although molecular studies have led to the establishment of different molecular groups within Colletotrichum isolates from strawberry, assigning taxonomic ranks is difficult because these techniques were developed for characterization. rDNA sequence analysis is a useful tool for species delimitation in Colletotrichum (Sherriff et al., 1994, 1995; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1994), but multigene loci analysis has proved more definitive. The divergences of rDNA-ITS sequences between isolates of C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides are too low to confidently separate the species (Sherriff et al., 1994; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Martínez-Culebras et al., 2003), and it has been suggested that C. fragariae falls within the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996). Martínez-Culebras et al. (2000) found only a specific MvnI site among the ITS1 region of the isolates of C. gloeosporioides instead of C. fragariae. This trait was subsequently confirmed by different original sequence data and could be used for differentiating C. gloeosporioides from C. fragariae (Martínez-Culebras et al., 2003), but it is conside
Cano et al. (2004) listed five species of clinical importance, while Damm et al. (2009) confirmed, using molecular data, that Colletotrichum truncatum was isolated from a corneal ulcer in a human eye. Colletotrichum dematium was also reported to cause eye keratitis (Giaconi et al., 2006) and fungal endophthalmitis, a potentially devastating ocular disease that results in poor visual outcomes (Chakrabarti et al., 2008). Cano et al. (2004) emphasized the need for a quick and unambiguous molecular test to distinguish Colletotrichum isolates, as prompt diagnosis is crucial since some drugs are not effective against certain Colletotrichum species. For example, itraconazole was not active in vitro against C. coccodes and C. dematium but was effective against some isolates of C. gloeosporioides. Cano et al. (2004) provided a table of morphological characters and conducted a sequence analysis based on a ribosomal DNA (rDNA) dataset to differentiate their clinical strains. Their phylogenetic analysis, aimed at separating the species, was rather simple, relying on very short fragments of the rDNA-ITS sequence (ranging from 124 to 174 bp) and was not compared to the ex-type strains. Although efforts were made to integrate these short sequences into the rDNA-ITS dataset of Cai et al. (2009), their phylogenetic positions could not be conclusively determined (L. Cai, pers. comm.).
Cano et al. (2004) utilized two strains representing two clinically relevant species and compared these against 18 non-clinical strains. Some of the strains have since been shown to be misidentified (e.g., C. dematium (C. truncatum) CBS 351.73 has been identified as C. circinans, while C. dematium CBS 167.49 is C. spaethianum). It remains unclear whether the other non-clinical strains have been accurately named, leaving uncertainty regarding the correct nomenclature for the clinical strains. With the recent epitypification of C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. graminicola, it is now possible to establish whether these clinically significant strains were accurately identified. There is an urgent need for mycologists to revisit the clinical Colletotrichum species following recent epitypification to determine which species are involved in human disease.
The use of Colletotrichum species in biotransformation was reviewed by García-Pajón et al. (2003), with subsequent publications (e.g., Bastos et al., 2007; Bajpai et al., 2009). Several species have been studied for their potential in biotransformation, particularly strains of C. gloeosporioides, which have garnered the most attention (García-Pajón et al., 2003). The significance and potential applications of the genus in industrial contexts have gained increasing attention over the
Biotransformations using Colletotrichum species have included the detoxification of phytolectins, as well as the biotransformation of saturated and unsaturated acyclic terpenoids, monoterpenoids, and related cyclic compounds including ketones, cyclic monoterpenes, sesquiterpenes, and steroids. In these studies, the Colletotrichum strains have been given specific names, but it is unclear whether these names are correct. For instance, the strain of C. acutatum could belong to one of three species currently recognized within the species complex. Additionally, the strains of C. atramentarium and C. lini used do not align with currently accepted names; the strains of C. capsici and C. dematium f. truncatum may represent the same species, as they are now considered synonyms of C. truncatum; and the strains of C. gloeosporioides (and G. cingulata) may represent several different species within this complex. It is essential to apply correct names to strains used in biotechnology, as the results of these studies may need verification, repetition, or comparison, and patents may be pending. Misnamed taxa would create significant issues.
A review of Colletotrichum indicates that species have likely been misnamed in many studies related to biotransformation, clinical aspects, pathogens, endophytes, molecular studies, saprobes, and other areas. Correct names are vital for future research to ensure that comparisons between studies can be confidently made. Currently, it is impossible to compare species used in various studies because names assigned by one group may differ from those given by another, even when they are working with the same species. Furthermore, identical names may be assigned to different species. Additionally, the names of species with gene sequences deposited in GenBank must be verified before submission, to prevent GenBank from becoming a repository for incorrectly named sequences. Presently, sequence data for the rDNA-ITS region and other genes are available for most species with existing type specimens, allowing researchers to check their sequences against these type strains for verification. In the future, it is hoped that a more effective, or even ideal, gene will be identified for barcoding species within the genus.
In summary, it is critical to maintain accurate taxonomic naming in research to avoid complications in future studies and data comparisons.
Several important papers dealing with the type specimens and cultures of species complexes have been published. These complexes can now be further studied and unraveled so that we can truly begin to understand the genus beyond the species complexes. Whether the complexes can be split into numerous species, a few species with many subspecies, varieties, or forms, or just into subspecies, varieties, or forms will remain a matter for debate, much of which depends on personal preference rather than scientific evidence. It is hoped that new species introductions will at least adopt the “genealogical concordance method” and more. There is an urgent need for agreement on protocols to handle the naming and describing of types, epitypes, new species, subspecies, varieties, and forms, which is the subject of a separate paper in this issue. These proposed recommendations may or may not be followed in the short term, but in the long term, Colletotrichum specialists should unite and derive a set of technical protocols that must be followed.
Until then, we predict that over the next 1-2 years there will be many new taxa of Colletotrichum named, resulting in perhaps 100-200 accepted species names. There will be numerous name changes to important plant pathogens, which will no doubt confuse and frustrate plant pathologists. There will be no consensus on which genes to use, and different sets of genes will be used, albeit with some overlap. There will be no standardized descriptions of species, and illustrations will range from a few spores only to comprehensive full-color plates; pathogenicity testing will be included in only a few cases. We predict that in 2-5 years, Colletotrichum taxonomy will become more settled; fewer new taxa will be introduced, and there will be fewer name changes. Plant pathologists will confidently accept the new names; sets of genes for use in species description will be agreed upon, and a single magic barcoding gene may be identified. Species descriptions will become standardized, or if morphological characters prove to be totally inadequate, they may be eliminated altogether, and pathogenicity testing will become essential to establish the biological role of these fungi.
Colletotrichum has particular biosecurity importance, and until the genus becomes settled, we suggest that plant quarantine authorities delay taking imprudent action. Many Colletotrichum species are proving to be widespread on a broad range of hosts, and some are proving to be endophytes as well as pathogens. Many of the recently described species are proving to be widespread on a range of unrelated hosts, some as endophytes, epiphytes, and pathogens, or as weak or opportunistic pathogens. Thus, besides existing species, such as C. kahawae, which is of quarantine significance and an important pathogen of coffee in Africa causing a devastating coffee berry disease, we suggest that some Colletotrichum species may prove to be cosmopolitan in distribution, and we do not need to be overly concerned about them. If countries wish to c
Although the many name changes within the genus Colletotrichum over the next few years may be confusing, it is necessary to establish a long-term stable taxonomic framework. The examples above illustrate numerous cases where we have no idea whether correct names were used. The situation is exacerbated by approximately 86% of names on GenBank under C. gloeosporioides being apparently misidentified. It is impossible to repeat or extend scientific work and compare findings with existing published work if the names applied to species in publications are erroneous. We have no option but to restudy, revise, and clarify the genus so that the naming of Colletotrichum species will, in the future, be reproducible and precise.
