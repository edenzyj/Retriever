Characterization and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose on chilli (Capsicum spp.) in Thailand
Fungal isolates from chilli (Capsicum spp.) fruits in Thailand that displayed typical anthracnose symptoms were identified as Colletotrichum acutatum, C. capsici, and C. gloeosporioides. Phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence data from ITS rDNA and β-tubulin (tub 2) gene regions revealed three major clusters representing these species. Among the morphological characters examined, the colony growth rate and conidium shape in culture were directly correlated with the phylogenetic groupings. A comparison with isolates of C. gloeosporioides from mango and C. acutatum from strawberry indicated that the host was not significant for phylogenetic grouping. Pathogenicity tests confirmed that all three species isolated from chilli were causal agents of chilli anthracnose when inoculated onto fruits of the susceptible Thai elite cultivar Capsicum annuum cv. Bangchang. Cross-infection potential was demonstrated by C. acutatum isolates from strawberry, which produced anthracnose on Bangchang. Notably, only C. acutatum isolates from chilli were able to infect and induce anthracnose on PBC 932, a resistant genotype of Capsicum chinense. This finding has critical implications for Thai chilli breeding programs, where PBC 932 is being hybridized with Bangchang to enhance anthracnose resistance in chilli cultivars.

Introduction
Colletotrichum spp. are among the most significant plant pathogens globally, responsible for the economically impactful disease anthracnose across a diverse range of hosts, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and tree fruits. Among these hosts, chilli (Capsicum annuum), recognized as the most important vegetable in Thailand, suffers severe anthracnose infections, resulting in yield losses of up to 50%. Typical symptoms of anthracnose on chilli fruits include sunken necrotic tissues with concentric rings of acervuli that are frequently wet. Fruits affected by blemishes face reduced marketability. Anthracnose in chilli has been linked to at least four species of Colletotrichum: C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides in India, Indonesia, Korea, and Thailand; C. acutatum in Australia and Indonesia; and C. coccodes in New Zealand.
Accurate taxonomic identification is necessary for plant breeding purposes and disease management. Traditionally, the identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species were based on morphological characters such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the existence of setae, or the presence of a teleomorph, as well as cultural characters like colony color, growth rate, and texture. These criteria alone are not always adequate to differentiate species due to variations in morphology and phenotype among species under different environmental conditions. To address the taxonomic problems associated with these traditional identification methods, DNA sequence analyses have been used to characterize and resolve the taxonomic complexity of various fungal genera, including Fusarium and Pestalotiopsis, as well as Colletotrichum. It has been noted that data derived from nucleic acid analyses should provide a more reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, sequence analysis of the ITS regions has proven useful in studying the phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum species. In addition to rDNA, partial β-tubulin and translation elongation factor (TEF) sequence analyses have been applied to resolve phylogenetic relationships among fungi, such as in Gibberella fujikuroi and the C. acutatum species complexes. The combined application of molecular diagnostic tools, alongside traditional methods, including morphological characterization and pathogenicity testing, represents an appropriate and reliable approach for studying species complexes of Colletotrichum. The objective of this study was to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species causing chilli anthracnose in Thailand.
For the isolation of Colletotrichum, isolates were collected from anthracnose lesions on chilli fruits (Capsicum annuum) in northern (Chiang Mai), northeastern (Ubonratchathani), and western (Kanchanaburi, Nakonpathon, Ratchaburi) districts of Thailand. Additionally, for comparative studies, isolates were obtained from infected fruits of mango (Mangifera indica) and strawberry (Fragaria spp.) from a local market in Chiang Mai. Isolation was conducted using two methods depending on fungal sporulation. For fruits without visible sporulation, tissue samples (5 × 5 mm) were taken from the margins of infected tissue, surface-sterilized in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 3–5 minutes, and rinsed three times with sterile water. These samples were then placed on the surface of water agar (WA) and incubated at room temperature (28–30 °C). The growing edges of any hyphal mycelium that developed from the disease tissue discs were then transferred aseptically to potato dextrose agar (PDA).
The fungi were identified following sporulation, and single-spore isolation was carried out using the procedure described by Choi et al. (1999), with modifications. Direct examination and single-spore isolation from infected fruits with sporulation were also performed. Spore masses were touched with a sterilized wire loop and streaked onto the surface of water agar plates, which were then incubated overnight. A single germinated spore was picked up with a sterilized needle and transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). Pure cultures were stored at 4 °C on PDA slants. Isolates were deposited in the University of Hong Kong Culture Collection.
Morphological examination involved preparing starter cultures by plating each isolate onto PDA at room temperature (25 °C). Three 4-mm plugs were aseptically punched from actively sporulating areas near the growing edge of a 5-day-old culture of each isolate. Each plug was placed onto PDA plates and incubated under the same conditions as starter cultures. Three cultures of every isolate were investigated. Cultures were incubated at room temperature for 7 days, after which the size and shape of 20 conidia harvested from every culture of each isolate were recorded. The colony diameter of each culture was recorded daily for 7 days. The growth rate was calculated as the 7-day average of mean daily growth (mm per day). After 7 days, colony size, color of the conidial masses, and zonation were recorded. Appressoria were produced using a slide-culture technique, where 10-mm squares of PDA were placed in an empty Petri dish, inoculated with spores taken from a sporulating culture, and covered with a cover slip. After 5–7 days, appressoria formed across the underside of the cover slip, and their shape and size were then recorded. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (P < 0.05) with Duncan’s multiple range tests and least significant difference values used with SPSS software version 13.0.
For molecular examination, DNA was extracted from all isolates using a modified protocol. Each culture derived from a single conidium from the original isolate was cultured on PDA and incubated at room temperature for 10–14 days. Mycelium was scraped from the surface of the plate and ground with sterilized quartz sand and CTAB extraction buffer in a 1.5-mL Eppendorf tube. The whole contents were incubated at 60 °C in a water bath for 40 minutes with occasional swirling. The solution was then extracted two or three times with equal volumes of phenol and chloroform until no interface was visible. The upper aqueous phase containing the DNA was precipitated by adding absolute ethanol and kept at –20 °C overnight. The precipitated DNA was then washed with 70% ethanol, dried under vacuum, suspended in TE buffer, and treated with RNase.
PCR was conducted to amplify complete ITS/5.8S rDNA and partial β-tubulin (tub2) sequences using fungal-specific primers ITS 4 and ITS 5 (White et al., 1990) and Bt 2A and Bt 2B (Glass & Donaldson, 1995), respectively. The PCR process was performed in a PTC-100 programmable thermal cycler with the following conditions: an initial denaturation at 95°C for 3 minutes; followed by 30 cycles consisting of denaturation at 95°C for 1 minute, annealing at 52°C for 50 seconds, and elongation at 72°C for 1 minute; concluding with a final extension step at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR products were verified using ethidium bromide staining on 1% agarose gels. Subsequently, these products were purified with the GFX PCR Purification Kit, following the manufacturer's instructions. DNA sequencing was conducted using primers ITS 5 and Bt 2A on the Applied Biosystem 3730 DNA analyzer at the Genome Research Centre of the University of Hong Kong. For several strains of the same species, sequencing was performed in both directions with the two primers to ensure accuracy. The sequences generated from this study were deposited in GenBank.
The sources of Colletotrichum isolates used in this study included various strains collected from Chiang Mai, Thailand. Each isolate was associated with a specific host, primarily Mangifera indica and Fragaria species. The table outlines the specific isolate numbers, their corresponding GenBank accession numbers for both ITS and β-tubulin sequences, and the geographic location of collection. Notably, multiple isolates of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were identified, reflecting the diversity of Colletotrichum species present in that region.

Pathology Herbarium, Department of Primary Industries and Fisheries, Queensland, Australia, were aligned in Clustal X and optimized manually. The partition homogeneity test, as implemented in PAUP*, was used to examine data for conflicting hierarchical signals and to evaluate congruence of the combined dataset. Branch support of the trees resulting from maximum parsimony analysis was assessed by bootstrapping. This was performed with 1000 replications using the heuristic search option to estimate the reliability of inferred monophyletic groups. Descriptive tree statistics, including tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), and homoplasy index (HI), were calculated for all parsimony trees. Colletotrichum boninense was the designated outgroup in all analyses.
For pathogenicity testing, three representative isolates of each species from each host were used. Isolates included C. acutatum from chilli, C. capsici from chilli, C. gloeosporioides from chilli, C. acutatum from strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides from mango. Isolates were cultured on PDA at 27°C under continuous fluorescent light. Conidia from 7-day-old cultures were harvested by adding sterilized distilled water onto the culture, which was then gently swirled to dislodge the conidia. The conidial suspension was filtered through two layers of muslin cloth. Bangchang, a susceptible Thai elite cultivar of C. annuum, and PBC 932, an anthracnose-resistant accession of C. chinense, were supplied by the Tropical Vegetable Research Center, Kasetsart University, Thailand. Non-infected fruits were surface-sterilized with 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5 minutes and washed twice with distilled water. The fruits were blotted dry with sterile paper tissue and inoculated using either the wound/drop or non-wound/drop method.
The wound/drop method involved pin-pricking the chilli fruit wall to a 1-mm depth and then placing 6 μL of conidial suspension over the wound. The non-wound/drop method involved placing 6 μL of conidial suspension onto the middle of each fruit. Preliminary experiments showed that non-wound inoculation with only 106 conidia mL–1 resulted in very little infection; hence, a higher concentration was used for that method. The inoculated fruits were incubated at 25°C with 98% relative humidity in the dark for 24 hours in a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Three fruits were tested per isolate, and the experiment was carried out twice. Disease reactions of the host were evaluated by measuring the length, width, and area of the typical anthracnose lesions that developed on the fruits. Symptoms were evaluated 9–15 days after inoculation. Fruit sizes were also recorded. Disease reactions were scored on a 0–9 point scale, modified from a disease scoring scale: 0 (highly resistant), no infection; 1 (resistant), 1–2% of the fruit with a necrotic lesion; 3 (moderately resistant), > 2 to 5% of the fruit with a necrotic lesion; 5 (susceptible), > 5 to 10% of the fruit with a necrotic lesion; 7 (very susceptible), > 10 to 25% of the fruit with a necrotic lesion; and 9 (highly susceptible), > 25% of the fruit showing ne
Data of infected fruit areas were also analyzed using analysis of variance (P < 0.05), with DMRT and LSD values used for multiple range tests with SPSS software version 13.0 (Kirkpatrick & Feeney, 2006).
Results
Collection and identification of isolates
Twenty-nine isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from infected chili fruits, three from infected mango fruits, and six from infected strawberry fruits, all showing symptoms of anthracnose. Identification of the isolates was based on the morphological descriptions of Colletotrichum species outlined by Mordue (1971) and Sutton (1992). From chili, seven isolates matched the description of C. acutatum, 13 matched the description of C. capsici, and nine matched the description of C. gloeosporioides. Three isolates from infected mango fruits matched the description of C. gloeosporioides, and six from infected strawberry fruits matched the description of C. acutatum.
Morphological examination
Distinctness in spore morphology and colony characteristics among the isolates resulted in the identification of morphological groups that correlated with the Colletotrichum species, regardless of the host species from which they were obtained.
Culture colony characteristics
Distinct morphological types on PDA were observed in each morphological group after seven days following subculturing. Isolates from group 1, mango C. gloeosporioides, produced colonies with little aerial mycelium in alternating concentric zones of light orange at the center, turning pale yellow towards the margin. Colonies produced by isolates from group 2, chili C. gloeosporioides, varied from greyish-white to dark grey; some isolates showed diurnal zonation of pale grey to black aerial mycelium, while others produced aerial mycelium in an even, felted mat. Isolates from group 3, strawberry C. acutatum, produced white to pale grey colonies showing diurnal zonation of dense and sparse development of aerial mycelia, sometimes with pinkish spore masses. Isolates from group 4, chili C. acutatum, produced pale orange colonies with little aerial mycelium and a few orange conidial masses around the center. Isolates from group 5, chil
There were three types of conidia observed in the three species of Colletotrichum: cylindrical, fusiform, and falcate. Colletotrichum capsici isolates belonging to group 5 produced falcate conidia, while C. acutatum isolates from groups 3 and 4 predominantly produced fusiform conidia, with an average occurrence of 80%. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates from groups 1 and 2 produced cylindrical conidia. However, there was little distinction among the groups in terms of conidia size.
Regarding appressorial morphology, there were few differences in appressorial shape and size between groups. Most of the appressoria formed in slide cultures were irregularly shaped, with only a few being ovoid. Ovoid appressoria were commonly observed in slide cultures from C. acutatum isolates from strawberry in groups 3 and 4.
In the phylogenetic analyses, PCR products obtained from the ITS regions (including 5.8 S) ranged from 550 to 600 bp, while those from the β-tubulin gene ranged from 450 to 500 bp. The final sequence alignment of the concatenated ITS and β-tubulin dataset comprising 43 taxa contained 984 characters, of which 229 were parsimony informative (23.27%), 575 were constant, and 180 were variable. Two trees were obtained when gaps were treated as missing data in a weighted parsimony analysis. The topologies of the two trees were not significantly different, and one of the trees had a total length of 721 steps.
A summary of morphological data for Colletotrichum species in groups 1–5 includes the following information:
For each species, specific values for length and width of conidia and appressoria, along with colony characteristics, are provided. Statistical significance for numerical characters is indicated by letters; values followed by the same letter in a column did not differ significantly at the 0.01 level.
In order to compare tree output with morphological and cultural characters, the phylogeny generated from the combined dataset was selected because most of the major clusters and subclusters were more resolved and received higher statistical support. Colletotrichum isolates fell into three distinct lineages (clusters X, Y, and Z) supported by 100% bootstrap values. Cluster X consisted of C. gloeosporioides isolates from chilli and mango. This cluster included isolates characterized by cylindrical conidia and a colony growth rate of over 11 mm per day. Cluster Y comprised C. acutatum isolates from chilli and strawberry. All isolates from this cluster had fusiform conidia and a growth rate of over 5 mm per day. Interestingly, C. acutatum isolates collected in Australia from strawberry and papaya formed a subcluster distinct from the isolates from Thailand, with high bootstrap confidence. Cluster Z received high statistical support and consisted only of C. capsici isolates from chilli. All isolates in this cluster were characterized by falcate-spored conidia and had an average growth rate of over 7 mm per day.
In terms of pathogenicity testing, both wound/drop and non-wound/drop inoculation methods showed that chilli fruits inoculated with C. acutatum isolates from strawberry (group 3) and the C. acutatum (group 4), C. capsici (group 5), and C. gloeosporioides isolates (group 2) from chilli displayed symptoms of anthracnose. The lesions were not significantly different in size, indicating a typical susceptible host reaction, with a disease score in the range of 7 to 9 (very susceptible to highly susceptible). However, chilli fruits inoculated with C. gloeosporioides from mango (group 1) did not exhibit typical symptoms. With the wound/drop inoculation method, lesions appeared 3 days after inoculation, while in the non-wound/drop method, lesions appeared 9 days post-inoculation.
In the wound/drop inoculation at an inoculum concentration of 10^6 conidia per mL, only C. acutatum isolates from chilli (group 4) produced typical anthracnose lesions on the fruits of C. chinense cv. PBC 932, with a disease score of 7 (very susceptible). In contrast, other isolates of C. acutatum from strawberry (group 3), C. capsici (group 5) from chilli, and C. gloeosporioides from both chilli and mango (groups 2 and 1, respectively) did not produce any symptoms on PBC 932 fruits. In the non-wound/drop inoculation, none of the isolates in any group
Morphological grouping, based on cultural morphology and spore shape, was in agreement with phylogenies derived from molecular data in this study; however, there was an overlap in conidial size among the five morphological groups studied. Sequence analyses from the ITS region and β-tubulin genes also did not provide a clear indication of possible phylogenetic relationships for isolates. The phylogenetic tree generated from a maximum parsimony analysis of a combined dataset of Colletotrichum ITS and β-tubulin gene sequences was rooted with C. boninense. Clusters X, Y, and Z correspond to C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. capsici, respectively. Values above branching nodes represent percentage bootstrap support calculated from 1000 replicates. Branch lengths are proportional to the number of nucleotide substitutions, measured by scale bars (bar = 10% sequence divergence).
The table describes the host reactions of Capsicum annuum cv. Bangchang and C. chinense PBC 932 fruits to isolates of Colletotrichum species following two different inoculation methods: wound/drop inoculation and non-wound/drop inoculation. It presents the infected fruit area percentages and corresponding host reactions for each isolate across both methods, indicating levels of susceptibility or resistance. For example, C. gloeosporioides isolates from mango showed no infection, while those from chili demonstrated varying infection percentages and host reactions. Similarly, C. acutatum isolates exhibited different levels of infection across host types. The table summarizes the results with averages for each isolate, marking them as highly susceptible, very susceptible, or highly resistant based on their infected area percentages. Statistical analysis is noted, indicating that values followed by the same letter in a column did not differ significantly at the 0.01 level in Duncan’s multiple range test.
These results indicated that spore size was homoplasious, supporting similar conclusions made by Hindorf in 1973, who found significant morphometric overlap of conidial size within Colletotrichum species. Differentiation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici was reliably based on appressorial shape; however, species delineation between C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides based on this character was not feasible. Sanders and Korsten (2003) also considered appressorial shape to be unreliable for species differentiation.
Cultural characteristics distinguish species among chilli, mango, and strawberry. Isolates from chilli were categorized into three Colletotrichum species based on their cultural traits, a classification robustly supported by phylogenetic analysis. The colony growth rate in vitro emerged as a crucial characteristic for differentiating the three Colletotrichum species. Phylogenies derived from sequences indicated a close relationship among isolates sharing the same growth rate, with C. acutatum showing the slowest growth rates. Simmonds (1965) and Sutton (1992) found that C. acutatum could be distinguished from C. gloeosporioides due to its slower growth. Molecular phylogenies did not reveal a correlation between DNA sequence data and host association within the Colletotrichum species. Colletotrichum capsici from chilli formed a distinct monophyletic group, whereas C. acutatum isolates from chilli were more closely related to C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This suggests that spore morphology and cultural characteristics reflect phylogeny more accurately than host association. Similar findings for C. acutatum (Du et al., 2005) and C. gloeosporioides (Guerber et al., 2003) were reported, despite contrasting results regarding the significance of host association in species like C. graminicola (Du et al., 2005). The subcluster of C. acutatum isolates from Australia may indicate phylogenetic divergence due to geographical isolation from Thailand. Studies by Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2003) on C. acutatum populations on strawberry from diverse geographical areas revealed both a homogeneous and a highly variable group, with no direct correlation to geographic regions. Additional isolates from Australia need to be examined to better understand the geographical divergence of C. acutatum.
Pathogenicity tests with the three Colletotrichum species isolated from infected chilli fruits demonstrated that all isolates were pathogenic on the susceptible Thai elite cultivar Bangchang. This confirmed that these three Colletotrichum species were causal agents of anthracnose infection on chilli. The non-infection of the resistant genotype C. chinense PBC 932 by C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides reinforced the significance of resistance in this genotype for the interspecific breeding program (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). The anthracnose symptoms produced by all three isolates of C. acutatum in wound-inoculated fruits of PBC 932 indicated that C. acutatum was pathogenic and could overcome resistance; however, infection in PBC 932 could not occur without wounding, highlighting the role of the cuticle in host resistance. Wounding significantly enhanced the ability of Colletotrichum to induce disease (Pring et al., 1995). Oh et al. (1999) also demonstrated the significance of cuticular wax layers on green and red pepper fruits in relation to infection by C. gloeosporioides, identifying a negative correlation between cuticle thickness and disease incidence. Plant breeders should be cognizant of the potential for C. acutatum to act as a major pathogen when developing new chilli cultivars resistant to anthracnose disease. The pathogenicity of C. acutatum from strawberry on chilli corroborated numerous reports regarding the cross-infection potential among different Colleto
Korsten (2003b) demonstrated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides from mango could produce symptoms on other hosts such as guava, chili pepper, and papaya. However, in the present study, isolates of C. gloeosporioides from mango did not produce any symptoms on inoculated chili fruits. While these mango isolates were highly pathogenic when re-inoculated onto mango fruits (data not shown), it remains unclear why they did not elicit symptoms on chili fruits. Further microscopic investigations are required to examine the host reaction to initial infection by these pathogens. Despite the high levels of infection potential observed on detached fruits, it is uncertain whether these isolates could pose a threat in the field, as the inoculation studies were conducted under optimal conditions to induce infection by the pathogen (Sanders & Korsten, 2003b). Additional studies using different inoculation tests and various stages of ripeness are necessary to confirm these results.

Than et al. (2008) examined the phenotypic diversity and characteristics of various Colletotrichum species, focusing on their pathogenicity and ecological roles. Thomson JD et al. (1997) developed the Clustal X software, which provides a flexible interface for multiple sequence alignment with built-in quality analysis tools. Vinnere O et al. (2001) identified the causal agent of anthracnose affecting Rhododendron in Sweden and Latvia, while Voorrips RE et al. (2004) conducted QTL mapping for anthracnose resistance in a cross between Capsicum annuum and C. chinense. White TJ et al. (1990) provided methodologies for amplifying and sequencing fungal ribosomal RNA genes for phylogenetic analysis.
