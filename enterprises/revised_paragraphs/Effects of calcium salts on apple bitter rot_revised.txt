Effects of Calcium Salts on Apple Bitter Rot Caused by Two Colletotrichum spp.
Bitter rot, caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (teleomorph = Glomerella cingulata) and C. acutatum, is a destructive fruit rot of apple and pear in the southern, central, and mid-Atlantic regions of the United States and in most countries where these fruits are grown. Prior to the development of effective fungicides, apple diseases could be extensive, with entire crops lost following periods of warm, wet weather. With the advent of modern fungicides, the disease is less prevalent than in the past, largely due to the efficacy of the ethylene-bis dithiocarbamates (EBDCs). However, since their reregistration in 1994, significant fruit losses from bitter rot have occurred in years when weather conditions were favorable and less effective fungicides were used. Although disease control is primarily achieved with the use of fungicides, orchard sanitation is an integral part of disease management.
The application of supplemental calcium to apples is a routine practice in orchards prone to calcium-related nutritional disorders such as cork spot and bitter pit. The most common form of calcium supplement is calcium chloride (as a 75% food-grade flake); however, many proprietary products containing calcium in other forms, or combined with other nutrients, are available. Calcium supplements are typically applied beginning 2 to 4 weeks after petal fall and may continue through the preharvest period for as many as eight applications. Recommended rates of calcium chloride range from 17 to 56 kg/ha per year, based on the potential severity of nutritional disorders. In addition to controlling nutritional disorders, increasing the calcium content of fruits and vegetables enhances their storage life. This effect is thought to be primarily due to calcium's role in ameliorating physiological disorders, thereby indirectly reducing pathogen activity. Much of the research with apples on enhancing storage quality and reducing decay through calcium supplementation has been conducted in the postharvest environment. However, few studies have examined the potential role of calcium supplementation in the preharvest period for reducing disease.
These trials were conducted to determine whether the use of calcium salts had any effect on fungal growth and disease incidence in vitro or in vivo.
Materials and Methods
Fungal isolates were obtained from K. S. Yoder (Virginia Tech, Winchester Agricultural Research and Extension Center) and were maintained on potato dextrose agar (PDA) in petri dishes. Isolates were subcultured weekly and maintained at 22°C during the experiment periods. Conidia for inoculum were harvested from 7-day-old cultures in all studies described. Longer-term storage of cultures was on PDA in culture tubes maintained at 4°C. Conidia were harvested by flooding the dishes with sterile distilled water, scraping the plates with a rubber spatula, and filtering the suspension through four layers of sterile cheesecloth. The desired concentrations of conidia were prepared by dilution from the original suspensions after counting with a hemacytometer.
Effects of calcium salts on spore germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth in vitro were studied. The pure calcium salts used in this research were calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate. These salts were selected based on preliminary studies that tested a broad range of calcium salts for their in vitro activity on the growth of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. To assess the effects of calcium salts on the germination of conidia, salts were prepared in sterile deionized distilled water and added to autoclaved warm (45 to 55°C) 2% water agar (WA) to achieve a final concentration of 1,000 mg of calcium per liter. The medium was then poured into 9-cm-diameter Petri dishes. A control group was established with WA medium not supplemented with calcium. Five 30-µl droplets of freshly prepared conidia suspension of either fungus were placed on each of three replicate dishes. Germination was assessed by examining 50 conidia from each droplet after 8 hours at 22°C, where a conidium was considered germinated if the length of the germ tube exceeded half the length of the conidium. This experiment was conducted twice. To evaluate the effects of calcium salts on germ tube elongation, the aforementioned procedure was followed, but 25 germ tubes from each droplet were measured with an ocular micrometer after 14 hours at 22°C. This experiment was also conducted twice. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance.
The study examined the effects of three calcium salts on conidial germination, germ tube elongation, growth in vitro, and infectivity in both laboratory and field settings for the apple bitter rot pathogens, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. Calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate at a concentration of 1,000 µg of calcium per ml showed no effect on conidial germination. However, calcium chloride and calcium propionate inhibited germ tube growth by 41% and 50%, respectively, compared to the control. All three calcium salts reduced fungal dry weight in liquid culture media. When calcium salt solutions were applied to wounded apples before inoculation, fruits treated with calcium chloride and calcium propionate displayed 30% smaller lesions than those treated with calcium silicate or the control, which were comparable. Additionally, fruits treated with calcium chloride and calcium propionate showed delayed formation of acervuli compared to the control and calcium silicate treatments, which were similar. In experiments where fruits were inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia (from 1 × 10³ to 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml), fruits treated with calcium chloride exhibited reduced incidence of infection after inoculation with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml. In all tests at concentrations of 1 × 10⁴ and 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, the control and calcium salt treatments yielded similar incidences of infection after inoculation. In six field trials, where fruits received three weekly dilute applications of calcium solutions, those treated with calcium salts and then inoculated with conidia of either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum showed lower incidences of infection compared to control fruits. These experiments demonstrate that calcium salts have suppressive activity against bitter rot pathogens and could be utilized as part of a disease management program.

The study was published in Plant Disease, Volume 83, No. 11, and accepted for publication on July 13, 1999.
To assess the effects of calcium salts on mycelial growth, salts were prepared in sterile deionized distilled water and added to autoclaved warm (45 to 55°C) 2% potato dextrose broth (PDB) to provide a range of concentrations from 600 to 1,200 mg of calcium per liter. The media were poured into 250-ml stationary flasks. A 30 µl drop of a suspension of 1 × 10^5 conidia from either fungus was placed in each flask. Flasks were incubated in the dark at 20 ± 2°C, and growth was assessed after 14 days by determining the dry weight of the mycelium. The experiment was performed three times with three replicate flasks per treatment, and results were subjected to regression analysis (SAS).
In another experiment, the effects of calcium salts on the infection of wounded apple fruit and the rate of formation of acervuli were studied. In 1996, harvested fruit of apple cultivar Nittany were placed on paper trays in plastic tubs. Each fruit was surface-disinfested with 70% ethanol and then wounded by piercing the epidermis with a sharpened 7-mm-diameter cork borer and removing the disk of epidermis with a sterile scalpel. Solutions of calcium chloride, calcium propionate, or calcium silicate (each at 1,000 mg of calcium per liter) or sterile deionized water were sprayed on the fruit until the surfaces were saturated. The sprayed fruit were allowed to air-dry, after which 30 µl of a suspension of 1 × 10^5 conidia from either fungus was placed in each wound. Lids were placed on the tubs to maintain a high relative humidity, and the diameter of the resulting lesions was measured 7 and 14 days after inoculation. Each lesion was measured twice at right angles, and the two values were averaged to obtain the lesion diameter. Periodic observations were made on the development of acervuli on the surfaces of lesions. Acervulus development was rated on a scale from 0 to 3, where 0 = no acervuli initials, 1 = black acervuli initials visible, 2 = pigmented acervuli present but not viscid, and 3 = pigmented acervuli with a viscid appearance. Each treatment for each fungus consisted of three replicates of 10 fruit each, and this experiment was conducted three times. Data on lesion diameter were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated using the Waller Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS). Differences among categorical rankings for acervulus development were determined with the Kruskal-Wallis test (SAS).
In a second set of experiments, fruit were prepared as above and inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia ranging from 1 × 10^3 to 1 × 10^5 conidia per ml. This experiment was conducted four times. The first trial was conducted in 1996 with cultivar Nittany, and the remaining trials were conducted in 1997 with cultivar Golden Delicious. Data on disease incidence and lesion diameter were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated using the Waller Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS).
The effects of field applications of calcium salts to apple fruit on the incidence and severity of bitter rot were also examined. In 1997 (Golden Delicious) and 1998 (Nittany), fruit on trees that had not been sprayed with fungicides were sprayed with calcium chloride, calcium propionate, or calcium silicate (1997 only) or calcium hydroxide (1998 only) at 1,200 mg of calcium per liter. Each set of 10 fruit per treatment was sprayed to runoff with 1,200 mg of calcium per liter + 0.1% Nufilm 17 weekly for three consecutive
Inoculations were made by preparing suspensions of conidia as described above, immersing 2.5-cm-wide cheesecloth strips (4 layers thick) into the suspensions, and wrapping the strips around the widest part of the fruit. The strips were secured with one layer each of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. The inoculum was removed after 5 to 7 days. Controls included fruit sprayed with distilled water and inoculated, as well as nonsprayed fruit that were inoculated without conidia. The experiment was conducted three times in each of the two years. All fruit from the three trials in each year were harvested at the normal harvest date for the particular cultivar. The harvested fruit were arranged in labeled trays and were observed weekly for disease incidence (presence of bitter rot determined from visible sporulation or reisolation when necessary). Data on disease incidence were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated with the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t test. The effect of the trial was determined to be not significant, so data from the separate trials were combined.
Effects of calcium salts on conidial germination, germ tube elongation, and mycelial growth in vitro were examined. At 1,000 mg of calcium per liter, calcium chloride, calcium propionate, and calcium silicate had no effect on conidial germination in vitro. Calcium chloride inhibited germ tube growth of C. gloeosporioides by 41% and of C. acutatum by 50% relative to the control. Calcium propionate inhibited germ tube growth of C. gloeosporioides by 48% and of C. acutatum by 80%. In liquid culture media, calcium chloride and calcium propionate reduced fungal dry weight.
Wounds treated with calcium chloride and then inoculated exhibited 20 to 29% smaller lesions than the control for C. acutatum and
Wounded fruit of both cultivars pre-treated with calcium chloride and then inoculated with varying concentrations of conidia exhibited reduced incidence of infection (62 to 87% less than the control) after inoculations with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml of either fungus. Golden Delicious, but not Nittany, fruit treated with calcium propionate and calcium silicate also exhibited reduced disease incidence after inoculation with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml of either fungus. In tests at 1 × 10⁴ and 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, no consistent treatment effects were observed, and with only three exceptions among the 32 treatment combinations, the control and calcium salt treatments had similar incidences of infection after inoculation of wounded fruit. Fruit of both cultivars treated with calcium chloride exhibited smaller lesions (63 to 72%) after inoculations with 1 × 10³ conidia per ml of C. acutatum. Similarly, lesions were 30 to 75% smaller after inoculations of calcium chloride-treated fruit with 1 × 10³ conidia of C. gloeosporioides per ml. Fruit of both cultivars treated with calcium propionate exhibited smaller lesions (22 to 70%) after inoculations with 1 × 10³ conidia of C. acutatum per ml, whereas lesions were 50% smaller for Golden Delicious fruit treated with calcium propionate and inoculated with C. gloeosporioides. Golden Delicious, but not Nittany, fruit also exhibited reduced severity after inoculation with all three inoculum concentrations of either fungus. For Nittany, in tests at 1 × 10⁴ and 1 × 10⁵ conidia per ml, the control and calcium salt treatments exhibited similar infection severity.
In six separate field trials conducted over 2 years, fruit treated with weekly dilute applications of calcium salts and then inoculated with conidia of either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum had lower incidences of infection compared with the controls. In 1997, for Golden Delicious inoculated with C. acutatum, most infections on control fruit became visible between the first and seventh days.
In the trials evaluating lesion diameter and acervulus development at 7 and 9 days post-inoculation of wounded Nittany apples with conidia of C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum, results showed significant differences in lesion size and acervulus ratings. For C. gloeosporioides, the control group had the largest lesion diameters, while fruit treated with calcium silicate had the smallest. Similar trends were observed for C. acutatum, with control fruit also exhibiting larger lesions. Acervulus development ratings indicated the most advanced stages in the control group, whereas calcium treatments led to lower ratings across trials, highlighting the efficacy of calcium treatments in reducing both lesion size and fungal development.
The incidence of bitter rot on Nittany or Golden Delicious apple fruit, assessed 7 and 9 days after inoculation of calcium salt-treated wounds with varying numbers of conidia, showed notable differences across treatments. For both fungi, control fruit generally displayed the highest incidence of infection, while fruit treated with calcium salts demonstrated significantly lower infection rates at certain concentrations, indicating the potential benefits of calcium treatments in
Golden Delicious, but not Nittany, was reduced at the lowest inoculum concentration tested. The high susceptibility of Nittany to the bitter rot pathogens may have resulted in a higher frequency of successful infections at the lowest inoculum concentration compared with Golden Delicious, which is more resistant. Although calcium salts did not reduce spore germination in this study, reduced germination of Penicillium digitatum spores exposed to calcium chloride has been observed, as well as reduced germination and germ tube growth of P. expansum and Botrytis cinerea. Calcium salts also have been shown to reduce mycelial growth in vitro and to reduce the incidence and severity of infection of peach fruits and shoots by Monilinia fructicola and Leucostoma persoonii, respectively. In the present study, we observed direct inhibition of germ tube elongation and inhibition of mycelial growth in in vitro assays, and it is likely that these effects occur in vivo in the presence of free calcium ions. The mechanisms by which calcium salts inhibit germ tube and mycelial growth are not known. One hypothesis is that high external concentrations of Ca²⁺ may lead to increased concentration of Ca²⁺ in the cytosol. Since maintenance of low basal concentrations of internal Ca²⁺ is essential for normal cell functions, organisms that are unable to regulate intracellular Ca²⁺ may exhibit compromised growth and development. Calcium ions may reduce the incidence of fungal infection by directly inhibiting fungal growth and by inhibiting cell wall-degrading enzymes produced by the pathogens. Apples in the mid-Atlantic region are host to a myriad of disease-causing fungi. Chemical management of apple diseases is usually accomplished so that multiple diseases are controlled with each fungicide application. The major fungal diseases and pathogens during the early part of the growing season are apple scab (Venturia inaequalis), powdery mildew (Podosphaera leucotricha), and cedar-apple rust (Gymnosporangium juniperi-virginianae). After the fruit are set, apple scab can continue to be a problem if scab lesions are present on foliage, and powdery mildew can continue to develop, especially on susceptible cultivars. As fruit develop, they are susceptible to the “summer diseases,” which include bitter rot, white rot (Botryosphaeria dothidea), black rot (B. obtusa), sooty blotch (a complex of fungal organisms), and fly.
In a study on Nittany apple fruit that received three weekly applications of calcium solutions followed by inoculation with conidia of either Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or C. acutatum, the incidence of bitter rot was recorded at various times after harvest. The results showed that for the treatment with calcium propionate, the disease incidence increased from 1.1% at harvest to 17.8% after three weeks. For calcium chloride, it rose from 2.2% to 23.3%, and for calcium hydroxide, from 2.2% to 27.8%. The control group had a significantly higher incidence, starting at 17.8% and reaching 71.1% after three weeks. For the other pathogen, C. gloeosporioides, the treatments had lower incidence rates overall, with the control group again showing the highest increase, from 13.3% to 51.1%. Statistical analysis indicated significant differences among the means of different treatments for each fungus, according to the Waller-Duncan test.
Treatment results over four weeks for two fungal pathogens, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, show the effectiveness of various calcium treatments.
For C. acutatum, the incidence of disease varied significantly with treatment. At one week, calcium propionate had a 0% incidence, while calcium chloride showed 0%, and calcium silicate recorded 7.8%. The control group had a 22.7% incidence. By the fourth week, calcium silicate reached 100%, while the control maintained a 100% incidence throughout the trial.
In the case of C. gloeosporioides, calcium propionate started with a 0% incidence, similar to calcium chloride. Calcium silicate again showed some effectiveness at 7.8% in the first week. The control group began with a 16.7% incidence and also achieved 100% by the end of the trial.
Values represent the percentage incidence from 90 fruit (3 replicates of 10 fruit each in three trials); however, some fruit abscised prematurely, leading to fewer than 10 fruit in certain replicates. Fruit was harvested on September 9, 1997, and assessed weekly. Inoculations were conducted with 1 × 10^5 conidia per ml on July 1, August 5, and September 2 for trials 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Letters indicate significant differences among means in columns within each fungus based on the Waller-Duncan test (P = 0.05).
The role of calcium supplementation in the integrated management of apple diseases remains unclear, as limited research has been conducted on various apple pathogens. Current knowledge is largely based on post-harvest pathogens. Calcium chloride and other calcium salts have demonstrated some suppressive activity against pathogens like V. inaequalis and P. leucotricha during research trials. However, these applications typically occur later in the growing season when the fungi pose a greater threat, limiting their efficacy for managing calcium-related deficiency disorders. Although further investigation is needed, calcium salts might play a future role in disease management for fruit designated for processing, especially in years with low inoculum levels and favorable environmental conditions.
