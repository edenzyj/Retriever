Dispersal of fungal plant pathogens by rain splash or wind is a critical component in the epidemic development of many diseases. Yet, splash dispersal has been infrequently studied compared to wind dispersal, until recently. Over the past 12 years, we have studied the splash dispersal of Phytophthora cactorum and Colletotrichum acutatum at three hierarchical levels: splash from single water-drop impactions, spore transport with simulated rain over small areas, and disease spread in the field with naturally occurring rain. The number of splash droplets produced, the number of spores disseminated, and the flight distance of the splash droplets all increase with the increasing size (and hence velocity and kinetic energy) of impacting raindrops. However, transport distance is very short, generally < 15 cm in each splash event, indicating that the deposition of spores on a potential infection site results from continual re-splashing of spore-carrying droplets across the soil surface or ground cover, and through the canopy. Thus, characteristics of the ground cover and plant canopy can have a dramatic effect on resulting disease spread; increasing roughness of the surface and leaf area index of the canopy reduce splash dispersal. Very short rain durations (e.g., < 2 min) can result in substantial dispersal, but rain intensity has a complicated (nonlinear) relationship to dispersal, since increasing rain intensity leads to both increased removal of spores from the source and loss of spores through the soil and canopy.

La dispersion des parasites des végétaux par les éclaboussures de pluie ou le vent est un facteur critique du développement épidémique de plusieurs maladies. Cependant, jusqu'à ces derniers temps, la dispersion par les éclaboussures n'a été que sporadiquement étudiée par comparaison à la dispersion par le vent. Durant les douze dernières années, nous avons étudié la dispersion, par les éclaboussures, du Phytophthora cactorum et du Colletotrichum acutatum à trois niveaux hiérarchiques : l'éclaboussement suite à l'impact d'une goutte d'eau, le transport des spores par une pluie artificielle au-dessus de petites surfaces, et la dispersion de la maladie dans le champ par la pluie naturelle. Le nombre d'éclaboussures produites, le nombre de spores disséminés et la distance parcourue par les éclaboussures augmentent avec la grosseur (et par conséquent la vélocité et l'énergie cinétique) des gouttes de pluie. Cependant, la distance de transport est très courte, généralement moins de 15 cm à chaque éclaboussement, ce qui indique que l'atterrissage des spores sur un site d'infection potentiel est le résultat d'éclaboussements répétés de gouttelettes portant des spores à travers le terrain et le couvert végétal. Ainsi, la nature du terrain et du couvert végétal peut avoir un effet important sur la dispersion de la maladie ; en augmentant la rugosité de la surface du sol et la densité du couvert végétal, on réduit la dispersion par les éclaboussures. Des pluies de très courtes durées (i.e. < 2 min) peuvent avoir une dispersion appréciable, mais l'intensité de la pluie augmente à la fois la dispersion originale des spores et la perte de spores à travers le sol et le couvert végétal.
La dispersion par éclaboussures de pluie est un élément critique dans le développement de nombreuses maladies des plantes. Bien qu'il puisse y avoir plus de pathogènes fongiques dont les spores sont dispersées par le vent que par la pluie, on pourrait soutenir que l'occurrence et la durée des épisodes de pluie limitent les épidémies causées par des pathogènes dispersés par la pluie plus que le mouvement de l'air ne limite celles causées par des pathogènes dispersés par le vent. Cela est dû au fait que les épisodes de pluie sont des événements sporadiques ou même chaotiques par rapport au mouvement de l'air. Étonnamment, malgré l'importance de la dispersion par éclaboussures, les détails physiques de cette dispersion n'ont été étudiés en détail que récemment. Fitt et McCartney décrivent plusieurs caractéristiques des champignons dispersés par éclaboussures de pluie. Les spores sont souvent à paroi mince, hyalines, entourées de mucilage, et peuvent être produites dans des pycnidies, des acervuli, ou sur des stromates. De nombreuses maladies importantes des légumineuses sont causées par ces types de champignons. Par exemple, le flétrissement ascochyte, causé par Ascochyta fabae f. sp. lentis, et l'anthracnose, causée par Colletotrichum truncatum. Comprendre ces maladies dépend, en partie, de la compréhension de la dispersion des pathogènes.

Generally, if a drop has sufficient kinetic energy (KE), splash droplets are formed that travel in ballistic trajectories short distances from the impact site. KE is directly proportional to drop mass (m) times velocity (V) squared. Because drop mass (or volume) is a direct function of drop diameter (Df cm; m = (π/6)D³), and terminal velocity (m/s) can be approximated by a power function of D (V = 17.7D²/³), raindrop size is the primary determinant of whether or not a splash will occur. Raindrops vary between 0.02 and 0.5 cm in diameter, with most being less than 0.2 cm. However, most splashes are caused only by large drops (>0.2 cm). Surface properties greatly affect results. Splash from a dry target depends on the surface inclination, flexibility, and whether the surface is hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Generally, if the surface is covered with water, the splash droplets consist of a mixture of the surface water and the impacting drop. If there are spores on the target or in the surface water film, some of these will be entrained in the splash droplets. Surface microtopography (i.e., roughness) also has a significant influence on splashing, with the magnitude of the splash distance increasing as roughness decreases.
To summarize, when a drop of diameter D impacts a lesion or spore suspension, n splash droplets are produced, with diameters between d₁ and d₂ and size distribution f(d). A proportion p of these droplets contain spores, the droplets travel an average of x cm, and there is an average of 5 spores per droplet (of those with any spores). Generally, 5 and p are functions of d [s(d), p(d)], with s(d) increasing according to the logarithm, square root, or cube root of d. Recently, a probabilistic model for the total number of splashed spores was developed as a function of n, f(d), p(d), and s(d). Splash droplets are quite small (often, d < 0.05 cm, on average), and their distribution has a high positive skewness, meaning there are many small droplets and very few large ones. Most droplets travel very short distances (<15 cm), and the distribution of x is also positively skewed. Flight distance is a function of droplet size, with larger distances traveled by smaller droplets. Thus, spores are transported very short distances because the largest splash droplets, which contain the majority of spores, travel only a few centimeters. The proportion of droplets with spores [p or p(d)] and the density of spores per droplet [s or s(d)] vary and are highly dependent on the pathogen, even under the same plant and surface conditions. For P. cactorum sporangia, p and s are very low (p = 0.3, s = 10-60), but these values are very high for C. acutatum conidia (p = 0.8, s = 20-11,000). Typically, p, s, n, and x increase with increasing D or kinetic energy of the impacting drop. For many of these splash variables, V (a function of D) is a good predictor of mean results, although the physical principles are not yet resolved.
The distribution of raindrop diameters is a direct function of rain intensity (mm/h). That is, the number of drops of any diameter D in a unit volume of air per unit diameter interval [N(D)] can be predicted from rain intensity by the so-called Marshall-Palmer equation or one of its generalizations. Most researchers now consider N(D) to be well represented by a gamma distribution. The distribution is positively skewed, with more small drops than large ones. Integration of a function of N(D) can be used to determine the number of impacting drops or the total kinetic energy of the impactions.
Because of these mathematical results and the strong functional relation between parameters, one can, in theory, relate the results from single-drop impactions to the population of raindrops of various sizes impacting during some unit of time. Rain simulation is a popular method for studying rain-splash dispersal. Since splash droplets travel such short distances, the dispersal process can be effectively studied in relatively small areas. At Ohio State University, we use a wide-angle spray nozzle on a rotating boom to generate uniform rain over a 1.2 x 1.2 m area. By selecting the proper nozzles and water pressures, rains are simulated that roughly match the cumulative volume distribution of natural rains from about 2 to 60 mm/h.
Using exposed immature strawberry fruit as a bioassay for dispersal, we have found that high levels of splash dispersal occur with very short rain durations. For instance, fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum are found at 30 cm from the inoculum source in as little as 30 seconds of rain (at 15 mm/h). By 2 minutes of rain, over 50% of the fruit become infected. Percentages are lower at 60 cm from the source, as expected based on dispersal gradients from point sources. The percentage of fruit infected by Phytophthora cactorum is less than for C. acutatum, but high fruit incidence is found after more than 4 minutes of rain. The fruit bioassay has been used to explore the effects of several factors on dispersal. For instance, a 2 m/s wind roughly doubles fruit disease incidence downwind compared to upwind (at 60 cm). With a 7° surface inclination, disease incidence downhill from the inoculum source is roughly double the value for uphill. Surface roughness also greatly affects fruit infection, with the highest incidence for plastic and the lowest incidence for straw mulch. An originally unexpected result was that increasing rain intensity does not necessarily lead to increased disease incidence.
Using the rain simulator, we found that susceptible plant parts do not have to be present when the original spore dispersal occurs. The inoculum source fruit and entire surface can be exposed to rain, the source fruit removed, healthy (target) fruit added, and the entire surface rained on for another 4 or 16 minutes. Sufficient spores are released from the source over a few minutes to be resplashed and deposited onto healthy fruit during subsequent rains.
Although using infected fruit as a measure of spore dispersal is convenient, it does not provide high enough resolution spatially or temporally to characterize dispersal for some studies. A more complete measure of spore dispersal would be to count and measure individual splash droplets and microscopically determine the number of spores per droplet.
Figure 2 describes the incidence of strawberry fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum at distances of 30 and 60 cm from the inoculum source during a 16-minute simulated rain at a rate of 15 mm/h. Two conditions are considered: no pre-rain (labeled "0") and pre-rain durations of 4 or 8 minutes (labeled "4" or "8"). In the pre-rain scenarios, both the surface and the inoculum source are exposed to rain for the specified duration before adding healthy fruit and applying an additional 16 minutes of rain over the entire area. In the no pre-rain scenario, the inoculum, healthy fruit, and the surface are all subjected to the 16-minute rain simultaneously. Statistical analyses for this experiment are referenced in the works of Madden et al. (1992) at Rothamsted.
An alternative method was developed to collect splash droplets using 'gravity samplers,' which consist of petri dishes containing a medium selective for Colletotrichum species. Calibration studies indicate that approximately 65% of the deposited spores successfully form colonies under various rain conditions. This measurement of spore deposition allows for the characterization of how surface topography and plant density influence splash dispersal. Due to the short-range nature of splash events, most splash droplets carrying spores are typically deposited on infection sites after multiple resplashings. Each splash involves the interaction between water droplets and the surface, making the surface properties significantly impactful on the results. Surface roughness, quantified as the standard deviation of elevation, is shown to be a strong predictor of splash dispersal magnitude. The steepness of the dispersal gradient is directly correlated with this roughness measure, and the overall number of colonies across the experimental area increases as roughness decreases. This correlation is further supported by experiments demonstrating that both the quantity and volume of splashed water droplets rise with reduced roughness. The dynamics of colony numbers and spore deposition over time and distance can be explained using a diffusion equation.
Figure 3 illustrates the average number of colonies of Colletotrichum acutatum in relation to the distance from an inoculum source across three surfaces: plastic, soil, and straw. The colony counts are normalized to ensure that all three curves align at a distance of zero. The slopes of the relationship between the natural logarithm of colonies per square centimeter per minute and the squared distance are -0.5 for plastic, -1.1 for soil, and -2.3 for straw.
Research by Boudreau and Madden indicates that plant density significantly affects splash dispersal. In their study, plant density was adjusted across two rows of strawberries, showing a notable relationship with the leaf area index (LAI) of the canopy, although this relationship is nonlinear. For instance, LAI increases from 0.9 to 1.8, and subsequently, the dispersal rate markedly decreases at higher LAI values. Additionally, positioning the inoculum within the canopy considerably diminishes the dispersal rate compared to having the inoculum outside the canopy.
Besides altering the transfer of droplets across the surface (as with surface roughness), the canopy is postulated to both reduce spore removal from the source fruit and resplashing of droplets by directly intercepting the incident rain. Effects of rain intensity have been ambiguous in previous studies regarding splash dispersal (e.g., Madden & Ellis 1990, Yang et al. 1990b, Reynolds et al. 1987, Reynolds et al. 1988, Shaw & Royle 1993, Fitt et al. 1986a). In some cases, increasing rain intensity reduced disease incidence, despite higher intensities being associated with larger raindrops that disperse more spores than smaller drops (Yang et al. 1991b, Huber et al. 1996). However, these prior studies cannot fully characterize rain intensity effects, either because only a small number of generally high intensities were tested or because the generated rains did not mimic naturally occurring ones in drop volume distributions. By generating rains with intensities of 2-60 mm/h (1.2-4.9 mL cm² h⁻¹) that reasonably duplicated the drop volume distributions of natural rains, we were able to quantify the relationship between rain intensity and dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum (Madden et al. 1996).
The total number of colonies (for a circular area with a radius of 100 cm over 46 minutes) increased linearly with rain intensity. However, the proportion of infected fruit (in a fruit bioassay for dispersal) increased with rain intensity to about 3.5 mL cm² h⁻¹ with the simulator and then declined somewhat. The reason for the decline can be understood by partitioning rain splash into three interrelated components: 1) spore removal from the source, 2) splash droplet transport (measured by the volume of splashing water), and 3) spore wash-off from potential infection sites and removal from the system. All three components increased
Considering the complicated effects of rain intensity summarized above, it is not surprising that it is difficult to predict disease increase based primarily on rainfall. Variations in the crop canopy and soil surface conditions, such as roughness and canopy structure, can considerably affect the outcome of splash dispersal. Because of the short flight distances of splash droplets, dispersal or disease gradients are typically steep in the field. For strawberry anthracnose, for instance, incidence generally declines to almost 0 at 2 meters from the inoculum source. Most gradients are described by the exponential model. However, it has been shown that a power model better fits dispersal gradient data for ascochyta blight of lentil. In fact, steeper but longer-distance gradients were found than typically exhibited for rain-splashed pathogens.
In experimental plots of varying plant densities, the mean proportion of strawberry fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum (y) and the distance from the inoculum source at which y declined to 0.10 (x10) were analyzed. For example, at distances from the inoculum source, the infection proportions varied with plant density, demonstrating a significant but nonlinear effect of plant density on disease incidence. The distance at which infection proportions declined to 0.10 generally decreased with increasing crop density.
Dispersal results for surface topography found with a rain simulator were validated in the field. The highest disease incidence was observed with plastic ground cover, while the lowest incidence was virtually 0 with straw. Disease incidence with soil was intermediate between plastic and straw. A nonlinear change in disease incidence with plant density was noted, with the highest incidence associated with an intermediate plant density.
A stronger indication of plant density effects is observed in the higher mean disease incidence on the near side (closest to the inoculum) compared to the far side of plant rows at the same distance from the inoculum source.
Conclusions indicate that a fuller understanding is emerging regarding the effects of rain splash on the dispersal of fungal spores. Based on detailed investigations using single-drop impactions and rain simulators, quantitative information is now available on the splash process, spore entrainment in droplets, and droplet transport across surfaces and through canopies. However, considerable research is still needed to translate controlled-study findings into field applications. It remains unclear how to formally link spore dispersal to rainfall properties, such as intensity, integrated over the duration of rain episodes.

The effects of variation in rain intensity during the course of a rain event are crucial, yet often overlooked, despite the established fact that intensity varies significantly over time. Additionally, the interaction of rain variables with pathogens, crops, and physical factors requires much more investigation. The research collaboration of Xuisheng Yang, M. A. Boudreau, L. L.
