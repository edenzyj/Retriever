In Cameroon, arabica coffee is grown on small family farms in the western highlands (1,000 to 2,000 m). The climate in the region is characterized by a 4- to 5-month dry season (November to March) and a monomodal rainy season lasting 7 to 8 months (March to October). This climate, typical of tropical high-altitude regions, favors synchronous flowering of plants triggered by the first rainy spells in mid-March. Fruit development takes place over a season lasting 6 to 7 months. Coffee berry disease (CBD), caused by Colletotrichum kahawae Waller & Bridge, is the main cause of yield loss in arabica coffee in Cameroon. After harvesting, at the beginning of the dry season, the absence of berries for a period of 5 months raises questions about pathogen survival and the means by which epidemics begin. Without fungicide applications, losses caused by C. kahawae can reach 90% on some small holdings at high altitudes (>1,600 m). Epidemics caused by fungi of the genus Colletotrichum occur frequently on perennial crops in the tropics. Epidemics may be caused by ubiquitous pathogens, such as C. gloeosporioides on mango, or by what is now C. acutatum on citrus, where the pathogen can attack several aerial tissues of those species. For these diseases, tissues susceptible to the pathogen are present throughout the year on the host plant. For other diseases, the pathogen attacks the host only during a certain stage of its development, and epidemics develop over a short period of the plant’s annual cycle. One such pathosystem is coffee berry disease (CBD) caused by Colletotrichum kahawae Waller & Bridge. As with other species of Colletotrichum, conidia are produced in acervuli and appear as an orange-colored, mucilaginous mass. Flower buds, branch bark, and mummified berries are considered potential sources of primary inoculum. At the start of the rainy season (March to October), C. kahawae resumes its parasitic activity, infecting young fruit (the “pin head” stage) 4 to 6 weeks post-flowering. The first symptoms are typically detected on 8- to 10-week-old fruits and appear as dark, sunken lesions that can expand and coalesce to affect the entire fruit. Some infected berries remain attached to branches and serve as a secondary source of inoculum. Several pathogen development cycles may occur up to the 25th week of fruit development, when berries develop ontogenic resistance, coinciding with the beginning of fruit endocarp hardening. CBD severity is highly dependent on climatic factors, particularly temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Rain is necessary for the dispersal of conidia of Colletotrichum spp. Optimum temperatures for conidium germination and mycelium growth are 20 to 22°C for C. kahawae on coffee. Appressorium formation occurs at the same temperatures and at relative humidity approaching 100%. Climatic conditions conducive to
Currently, CBD is managed through host resistance, cultural practices, and chemical control. However, these management practices could be used more efficiently as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy that can be applied by producers of arabica coffee. Such an approach requires prior knowledge of the host/parasite/environment interactions that govern disease development. We therefore carried out spatio-temporal monitoring of the disease to gain a clearer understanding of how epidemics developed in a high-altitude region with high disease pressure. The study was undertaken at two sites with contrasting agro-ecological conditions. The spatial dynamics of the disease within plots were analyzed, and the type of dispersal was identified to help optimize control methods.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Characterization of plots
Studies to examine the spatio-temporal effects of CBD were conducted at two locations in Cameroon, Bafou (05°33.540'N, 10°04.520'E, 1,820 m elevation) and Santa (05°47.190'N, 10°09.672'E, 1,750 m elevation). At each site, a uniform plot grown without shade and without intercrops was chosen. The plots, measuring approximately 1,000 m², contained 58 coffee trees at Santa and 67 at Bafou. Each coffee tree was identified spatially by its coordinates and an identification number. The coffee trees at Santa were about 50 years old and were pruned to an umbrella-type architecture. At Bafou, the trees were around 20 years old with a single stem and were pruned to a pyramid shape. Coffee plants at both locations were of the cultivar Jamaica, which is highly susceptible to CBD. The coffee trees were spaced 3 × 2.5 m apart and were maintained by pruning to remove dead branches, suckers, and mummified berries. They were fertilized after each fruit set with mineral fertilizer (N-P-K: 20-10-10, ADER-Cameroon) at a rate of 200 g per plant. Two annual applications of glyphosate (Round-Up; Monsanto) at 2.4 liters/ha were made to control weeds. This study was conducted on the same trees for two consecutive years: from 2003 to 2004 at Santa and from 2004 to 2005 at Bafou.
ABSTRACT
Coffee berry disease (CBD) is caused by Colletotrichum kahawae. This pathogen only attacks green berries, causing cherry rot and premature fruit fall. The disease leads to major harvest losses in the western highland region of Cameroon. The origin of the primary inoculum and the beginning of epidemics are unknown. The interactions between the pathogen and its host were studied at locations where CBD was known to cause severe disease. The disease was monitored weekly in uniform plots of adjacent coffee trees at Santa (1,750 m) i
ϒ(h) = [1/2N(h)] ∑[zi – zi+h]² where ϒ(h), the semivariance for interval distance class h, is half the average of the sum of square differences between the percentage of infected berries for N sample pairs of trees, with the lag interval h. zi is the percentage of infected berries measured for sample trees at point i, and zi+h is the percentage measured for sample trees at point i+h. The variogram is a model for average semivariances of all possible interval classes plotted against their corresponding lag distances. The data were auto-fitted to the exponential, spherical, and Gaussian isotropic model variograms to analyze the multidirectional spatial dependence between coffee trees. These models are described by three parameters: (i) the separation distance or the range (A) over which the spatial dependence is apparent, (ii) the y-intercept of the model or the nugget variance (C₀), which indicates the discontinuity of the variogram at lag zero, and (iii) the sill (C + C₀), which is the model asymptote. The residual sums of squares (RSS), the R² coefficient, and the proportion of C/(C₀ + C) are the statistics mainly used for interpreting the validity of the variogram model. The RSS provides an exact measure of how well the model fits the variogram data; the lower the reduced sums of squares, the better the model fits. The R² coefficient provides an indication of how well the model fits the variogram data, but it is not as sensitive or robust as RSS for best-fit calculations. The proportion of C/(C₀ + C) provides a measure of the proportion of sample variance (C₀ + C) that is explained by spatially structured variance C. This value will be 1 for a variogram with no nugget variance (where the curve passes through the origin) and 0 where there is no spatially dependent variation at the specified range. C₀ (the nugget variance) is the y-intercept of the model, and C₀ + C (the sill) is the model asymptote.
Kriging analysis was used to localize foci on the experimental plot. Kriging is a nearest-neighbor interpolation technique in which the estimated disease level at a given tree location is a weighted moving average of best estimates to minimize local area variance. It is the best linear unbiased estimator based on prior selection of a variogram. Kriging can only be performed for variograms showing spatial dependence between trees. The analysis of variance and the descriptive maps of disease spatial distribution were carried out with SAS software. The analysis of nonlinear regressions was carried out with CurveExpert software. Semivariogram and kriging analyses were carried out with GS+.
RESULTS
Incidence of CBD depending on branch position on the coffee tree. The total number of berries differed each year, irrespective of the site. It was relatively high in 2004 at both sites, with an average of 48 berries per branch at Bafou and 66 berries at Santa. The initial number of berries was small in 2003 at Santa and in 2005 at Bafou. At Santa, the percentage of infected berries was estimated to be around 40% in each of the two study years. However, at Bafou, CBD incidence varied significantly (P < 0.0001) from one year to the next. It was estimated at around 30% of diseased berries in 2004 and 20% in 2005. There were no differences between coffee tree branches at Santa, but a significant interaction between coffee tree branches and production years at Bafou. In 2004, the highest incidence was found in the upper branches. Disease rates were constant on all the branches in 2005.
Spatio-temporal dynamics of the disease. Temporal dynamics. The best fits for temporal disease spread were obtained with the logistic and Morgan-Mercer Flodin (MMF) models, both belonging to the sigmoidal model family. The logistic model was the most suitable to explain the temporal disease spread at both sites, although the 2004 data were well fitted by the MMF model at Santa. At Santa, the infection spread rapidly between the 10th and 20th weeks after flowering. The maximum rate of disease spread was estimated at around 6% (diseased new berries per week) in 2003 and 5% in 2004. The rate of spread was slower at Bafou, with around 4% in 2004 and 3% in 2005. The duration of the disease exponential phase was estimated at 13 to 15 weeks at Santa and between 10 and 13 weeks at Bafou. In 2004, the rainfall received during the period of exponential disease spread was higher at Santa than at Bafou. The cumulative percentage of infected berries during the asymptotic phase of the disease was higher and more stable at Santa than at Bafou, regardless of the year. At Santa, this disease period was observed around the 20th week in 2003 and around the 25th week in 2004. At Bafou, it occurred around the 20th week for both years.
Spatial dynamics at different stages of the epidemic. At the start of the epidemic, symptoms were observed on trees that were either isolated or in small clusters. Semi-variogram analysis indicated an isotropic type of distribution, showing that coffee berry disease (CBD) did not spread in a preferential direction. In 2003 at Santa and 2004 at Bafou, semi-variogram analysis revealed a pure nugget effect (no spatial dependency between the coffee trees) at the start of the disease, and beyond the 10th and 13th weeks at Bafou and Santa, respectively. Spatial correlation among infected coffee trees was observed between the 8th and 10th weeks at Bafou, and the 11th and 13th weeks at Santa. For both sites, the range decreased over time and the sill increased. The range varied from 2.64 to 3.6 m at Santa, meaning that spatial dependence can only be observed between immediate neighboring trees. The largest range at Bafou was 8.37 m, indicating spatial correlations up to three trees away. The first two semi-variograms were spherical at Santa, while the last one was Gaussian. At Bafou, all of them were Gaussian. These curves showed that CBD spread was stepwise at Santa; in contrast, the disease could spread to coffee trees that were more than two units away at Bafou. However, an analysis of the data obtained at Santa revealed large residual errors and weak coefficients of determination.
Total number of berries and % infected berries were recorded across different years and altitudes.
In 2003, the Upper region had 32.82% of berries infected, the Middle region had 40.22%, and the Lower region had 36.49%.
In 2004, the Upper region showed an increase to 50.14% infected berries, while the Middle and Lower regions had 48.09% and 47.33% infected berries, respectively. The % infected for the Upper, Middle, and Lower regions were 33.71%, 27.32%, and 22.88%, indicating a variation in infection rates across regions.
In 2005, the trend shifted, with the Upper region showing 27.62% infected, the Middle region at 25.26%, and the Lower region at 21.12%, reflecting lower infection rates compared to previous years. The values indicate a statistical significance with means separated by the Student-Newman-Keuls test at P = 0.05.
In the second year of observations (2004 at Santa and 2005 at Bafou), infection foci were not detected at Santa, unlike Bafou, where they were observed from the 10th to the 24th week. However, the foci at Bafou in 2005 were influenced by experimental bias due to around 10 coffee trees lacking berries. The semi-variogram at this site displayed morphological diversity over time, exhibiting an exponential pattern in the 10th week, indicating significant irregularity in infection levels when the first symptoms appeared. Between the 11th and 24th week, the pattern was Gaussian.
At Santa, infection foci were only observed in 2003, as depicted in maps from that year. However, they were detected annually at Bafou, with a focus at the same spot reappearing over two successive years.
In discussion, it was noted that in several countries where Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) is present, infection severity typically increases with altitude due to cooler temperatures favoring the disease. However, this study found less disease development at higher altitudes, likely due to varying rainfall between the two sites. In pathosystems where pathogen propagation occurs through splashing, rainfall intensity aids the dispersal of inoculum, similar to cases with Gibberella zeae on wheat or Botryosphaeria dothidea on pistachio.
At Santa, CBD severity remained uniform across coffee tree branches regardless of the year. Conversely, at Bafou in 2004, branches were attacked in accordance with an ascending severity gradient. Conidia were generally dispersed from the top to the bottom of the trees, transported by gravity and raindrops, suggesting worse disease effects on lower branches, similar to observations with citrus where C. gloeosporioides infections develop along a descending gradient.
C. kahawae infection by rainfall was less effective on the berries of the lower branches due to a possible barrier effect of the branches in the canopy. In addition, since infection was more severe on the fruits on the upper branches rather than on the lower branches, coffee trees in the umbrella form at Santa, where most of the berries are concentrated toward the canopy, were more severely attacked by CBD than those at Bafou. Little is known about the role of coffee tree architecture on CBD development. We feel such a study is necessary to assess the spatial distribution of the disease on a coffee tree scale, and to determine the specific impact of rainfall on its distribution.
The table presents model functions for the temporal progression of coffee berry disease at two sites, Santa (2003–2004) and Bafou (2004–2005). The models include various families such as sigmoid, polynomial, and miscellaneous types. For Santa in 2003, the logistic model produced a specific equation with parameters showing high fit values, while the polynomial model showed a third-degree polynomial fit. Similarly, in 2004, the Morgan-Mercer-Flodin model was used alongside polynomial and sinusoidal fits. Bafou displayed logistic and polynomial models in both 2004 and 2005, with each model detailing specific parameters and fit statistics.
The next table describes the characteristics of coffee berry disease epidemics observed at both sites, detailing parameters such as K, B, r, slope, and duration for different years. It shows variations in disease parameters between Santa and Bafou, highlighting significant differences in disease dynamics over time.
The figure illustrates the weekly cumulative rainfall during the exponential period of disease progression for coffee berry disease. Additionally, another figure displays the spatial distribution of coffee trees affected by the disease at Santa, indicating the cumulative percentage of infected berries over time across a coordinate plot.
Finally, a table summarizes the characteristics of semi-variograms obtained at Santa and Bafou for coffee berry disease. It details the age of the berries, range, sill, and model types used to analyze disease spread, including observations of pure nugget effects and various model fits over different weeks.
At both sites, the best fits for temporal CBD spread were obtained with the logistic model (R² ≈ 0.998). Logistic regressions are highly suited to modeling the temporal dynamics of polycyclic epidemics during which the secondary inoculum is favorable to exponential disease development. They are particularly suitable for pathosystems in which new healthy organs are contaminated gradually during their growth, up to their ontogenic resistance period. At Santa, the rate of disease spread varied each year, probably due to climatic variations, pathogen infection pressure, and fruit receptiveness during their growth. However, the ultimate infection level remained substantially the same over the two years. The model parameters (K, B, and r) varied depending on the site and year, suggesting a considerable influence of mostly random climatic parameters (rainfall, temperatures, wind, etc.) on the temporal spread of CBD.
Various spatial analysis methods have been used by numerous authors to study the regionalization of diseases in plots. Those methods vary depending on the pathosystems; however, they all have the principle of determining spatial correlations that might exist between plants within the plot. A study of semi-variograms using geostatistical analyses enabled the identification of CBD infection foci. Sache defined the focus as “the first point of inoculation characterized by a quantity of disease that is far greater than that seen on surrounding plants.” Such foci were found at the two sites during the first year of observations (2003 at Santa and 2004 at Bafou). They appeared 1 to 2 weeks after the first symptoms and became blurred during the exponential phase of the disease, precisely at the time of its maximum spread. In the second year of observations, infection foci were not seen at Santa, unlike at Bafou, where they persisted from the start of the disease.
Fig. 4 illustrates the semi-variograms that indicate spatial correlations in the first year of observations of coffee berry disease (CBD) in 2003 at Santa. The lag distances on the x-axis correspond to the model and need to be multiplied by 3 m to determine the actual interval in the field. Fig. 5 presents the semi-variograms obtained over the two years of observations (2004 and 2005) at Bafou, showing that in 2005, the trend of the curves is similar to that of the 12th week. Again, the lag distances on the x-axis derive from the model and should be multiplied by 3 m to obtain the field interval. The results reflect the nonpermanent nature of CBD infection foci from one year to another in the study plots. This variability suggests that in cases of diseases dispersed over large distances, such as rust diseases, the foci may originate from inoculum introduced from outside sources.
In the case of annual crop diseases, foci may survive from harvest residues contaminated by the pathogen. For diseases with limited dispersal, such as anthracnose, especially on perennial crops, primary infection foci are typically not due to an allogenic inoculum. Disease emergence is attributed to a primary inoculum conserved within the plot, either in the tissues of seemingly healthy organs or in the tissues of dead organs, such as leaves, branches, or mummified fruits. All the foci revealed by the semi-variograms were located in the plots through kriging. These may have resulted from a heterogeneous distribution of the primary inoculum within the plot or may appear after highly conducive microclimatic conditions in specific zones. It is possible that such microclimates arise preferentially for several years in certain parts of the plots. In that case, they could lead to the recurrent appearance of infection foci in the same locations in coffee plantations, as observed over the two years of observations at Bafou. After harvesting, when there are no longer any berries on the coffee trees, the pathogen survives as a saprophyte in tissues not affected by the infection. At the beginning of the following season, those tissues are potential sources of auto-inoculation likely to cause fresh infections on each plant in the plots. The spread of disease by foci would thus seem to result from a combined effect, within a particular microclimate, of auto-inoculation of the plants and lateral dispersal of conidia.
The focus dispersal maps for coffee berry disease in Santa in 2003 indicate the presence of infection foci marked as "F." Additionally, the maps obtained over the two years of observations at Bafou (2004 and 2005) similarly indicate infection foci, also marked as "F." These visual representations illustrate how infection foci were distributed across the studied areas. The data suggests that infection foci diminish over time, as dissemination occurs more quickly at the tree scale than within the plot, a trend observed in other diseases, such as those caused by Monilinia fructigena on apple and Phytophthora megakarya on cocoa.
The isotropy of the semi-variograms obtained in our study showed that CBD infection foci do not appear to follow a preferential direction within plots. This result indicates the random nature of CBD dissemination, which is mostly the result of rainfall. The spherical semi-variograms observed at Santa demonstrated that contamination took place in a stepwise manner between the coffee trees in the plot, restricting the infection foci to a small number of plants. However, the Gaussian type semi-variograms, mostly found at Bafou, revealed some spatial correlations between coffee trees up to three units apart. This interval, which corresponds to a distance of about 9 m between the trees, indicates that the foci at that site spread to a larger number of individuals compared to those seen at Santa. Given the main foci identified in 2004 at Bafou, the spatial spread of the disease could be estimated at one unit per week, corresponding to around 3 m per week. To conclude, CBD infections start from foci, whose extent and regularity depend on factors that are not yet well known. Such foci occur 1 or 2 weeks after the onset of the disease and fade at the end of the exponential phase of the disease, shortly before the change in curve concavity. Our results suggest that studies conducted on pathogen survival at these foci will provide useful information for more effective control of the disease. Moreover, the epidemic spread curves indicate that fruits should be protected from CBD before the 8th week after flowering.
