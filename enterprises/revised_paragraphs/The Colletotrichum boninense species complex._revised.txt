Abstract: Although only recently described, Colletotrichum boninense is well established in literature as an anthracnose pathogen or endophyte of a diverse range of host plants worldwide. It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognized here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii, and 12 previously undescribed species: C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae, and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are only known from New Zealand, perhaps reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was made, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and the name replaced with C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are the conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening that also sometimes extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, as well as conidia that have a prominent basal scar. Many species in the C. boninense complex form teleomorphs in culture.

INTRODUCTION
Colletotrichum boninense was first described from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum (Amaryllidaceae) collected in the Bonin Islands, Japan. According to these authors, the species was associated with a variety of host plants in Japan, including Clivia miniata (Amaryllidaceae), Cucumis melo (Cucurbitaceae), Cattleya sp., Cymbidium sp., Dendrobium kingianum (Orchidaceae), Passiflora edulis (Passifloraceae), and Prunus mume (Rosaceae). Since 2003, C. boninense (in its wide sense prior to our research) has frequently been identified as a pathogen causing fruit and leaf anthracnose, as well as an endophyte of a range of host plants worldwide, especially belonging to Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. For example, C. boninense was found to be associated with diseases of Leucospermum and Protea cynaroides in Australia and Zimbabwe and with Eucalyptus in South Africa. In pathogenicity studies, it was shown to infect Protea leaves and stems. Farr et al. reported C. boninense on Dracaena and Pachira in China, Passiflora in New Zealand, and Hippeastrum in Brazil and the Netherlands. According to Johnston & Jones and Johnston et al., C. boninense (= C. gloeosporioides groups E–I in Johnston & Jones) occurs on a range of hosts including Capsicum, Citrus, Cucurbita, and Solanum species in New Zealand.
Colletotrichum boninense was reported as the cause of anthracnose of pepper (Capsicum annuum) in Brazil, of passion fruit (Passiflora) in Florida and Brazil, and of Crinum asiaticum in China. Lee et al. observed leaf anthracnose on Japanese spindle tree (Euonymus japonica) in Korea and demonstrated the pathogenicity of C. boninense. Nguyen et al. reported C. boninense as a pathogen of berries and twigs of Coffea in Vietnam. Recently, C. boninense was identified as one of the causal agents of anthracnose in avocado (Persea americana) in Mexico. Lu et al. detected probable C. boninense isolates as endophytes in leaves of several tree species in the Iwokrama Forest Reserve in Guyana. Other reports of C. boninense as endophytes include Pileggi et al., who isolated it from leaves of the medicinal plant Maytenus ilicifolia in Brazil. Joshee et al. studied foliar endophytes of Podocarpaceae and Myrtaceae trees in New Zealand and identified several of them as belonging to the C. boninense group. Several other isolates causing anthracnose on tamarillo, Passiflora, and mango from Colombia and endophytes in coffee plants from Colombia and Hawaii belong to the C.

Each entry includes the source location and unique identification codes, which are crucial for classification and research purposes. The list encompasses various plant species and their associated fungal strains, highlighting their ecological significance and potential applications in agriculture and medicine.
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex includes various specimens listed by their GenBank accession numbers, hosts, substrates, and countries of origin. For instance, one specimen identified as C. karstii was sourced from Quercus salicifolia in Panama, while another, S. integerimmium, was collected in Australia. The table details various other species, their accession numbers, and the specific plant hosts from which they were derived, such as Solanum betaceum from Colombia and Theobroma cacao from Panama. Each entry includes multiple accession numbers for different genetic sequences, showcasing the diversity of the Colletotrichum species across various geographical regions.
The following species were identified in the study: Passiflora edulis (leaf blotch) from New Zealand and several isolates of Colletotrichum sp. from the CBS culture collection. Notably, the study references Dendrobium kingianum from Japan, and several strains were analyzed using a multi-gene approach to characterize the C. boninense species complex.
C. boninense has often been confused with C. gloeosporioides, which shares similarities in conidia morphology, differing primarily in the length-to-width ratio and the presence of a scar at the base of the conidium. Historical records show that many isolates of C. boninense have been misidentified as C. gloeosporioides, and the extensive synonymy associated with C. gloeosporioides suggests that some synonyms may actually refer to C. boninense. Recent phylogenetic analyses indicate considerable infraspecific variation within C. boninense, with several clades showing sexual morphs.
The isolates analyzed included those previously identified as C. boninense along with related cultures from the CBS culture collection. Type specimens for the studied species are housed in various fungaria, including the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS) in Utrecht, the Botanische Staatssammlung München in Germany, and the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew in the United Kingdom. All morphological descriptions are based on ex-holotype or ex-epitype cultures, with additional features noted for isolates deviating from these types. Subcultures are maintained in the CBS, IMI, and ICMP culture collections.
To enhance sporulation, 5-mm-diameter plugs from the margin of actively growing cultures were transferred to the center of 9-cm diameter Petri dishes containing synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA) amended with autoclaved filter paper and double-autoclaved stems of Anthriscus sylvestris placed onto the agar surface. The strains were also studied after growth on oatmeal agar (OA) or 2% potato-dextrose agar (PDA). Cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements and photographs of characteristic structures were made according to methods described by Damm et al. (2007). Appressoria on hyphae were observed on the reverse side of colonies grown on SNA plates. Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure, and observed with a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope or with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using differential interference contrast illumination. Colony characteristics and pigment production on SNA and OA incubated at 20 °C were noted after 10 days. Colony colors were rated according to Rayner (1970). Growth rates were measured after 7 and 10 days.
Genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted using the method of Damm et al. (2008). The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of the actin (ACT), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), beta tubulin (TUB2), histone3 (HIS3), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified and sequenced using specific primer pairs. The PCRs were performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 12.5 μL. The GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1, TUB2, HIS3, and CAL PCR mixture contained 1 μL of 20x diluted genomic DNA, 0.2 μM of each primer, 1x PCR buffer, 2 mM MgCl2, 20 μM of each dNTP, 0.7 μL DMSO, and 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase. Conditions for amplification included an initial denaturation step of 5 minutes at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94 °C, 30 seconds at 52 °C, and 30 seconds at 72 °C, with a final denaturation step of 7 minutes at 72 °C. The DNA sequences obtained from forward and reverse primers were used to obtain consensus sequences, which were added to the outgroup and the alignment assembled and manually adjusted. To determine whether the seven sequence datasets were congruent and combinable, tree topologies of 70% reciprocal Neighbour-Joining bootstrap with Maximum Likelihood distances were compared visually. A maximum parsimony analysis was performed on the multilocus alignment.
Analysis Using Parsimony v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2000) utilized the heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing, and all characters were unordered and of equal weight. The robustness of the trees obtained was evaluated by 500 bootstrap replications with two random sequence additions (Hillis & Bull 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting tree. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was employed to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) for the combined sequence datasets of Damm et al. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene, determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3, were included for each gene partition. The analyses of two MCMC chains were run from random trees for one million generations, with samples taken every 100 generations. The likelihood scores of the two runs were 2,730 and 2,170; thus, the first 2,450 trees were discarded as the burn-in phase of the analysis, with posterior probabilities determined from the remaining trees. Sequences derived in this study were lodged at GenBank, and the alignment was submitted to TreeBASE, with taxonomic novelties recorded in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004a).
RESULTS
Phylogeny
The seven sequence datasets showed no conflicts in tree topology for the 70% reciprocal bootstrap trees, allowing for their combination. In the multigene analyses (gene boundaries of ITS: 1–561, GAPDH: 572–864, CHS-1: 875–1154, HIS3: 1164–1562, ACT: 1573–1851, TUB2: 1862–2363, CAL: 2374–2823) of 87 isolates of C. boninense and related Colletotrichum species, including the outgroup, a total of 2,823 characters, including alignment gaps, were processed. Among these, 572 characters were parsimony informative, 247 were parsimony-uninformative, and 2,004 were constant. Following a heuristic search using PAUP, 958 most parsimonious trees were retained (length = 1,423 steps, CI = 0.740, RI = 0.927, RC = 0.686, HI = 0.260), of which one is represented in the results. The topology of the 958 trees was similar, confirmed by a broad selection of trees, although they differed in the positioning of taxa within the subclades and the placement of strain CBS 130241. For Bayesian analysis, models selected included HKY+G for ACT and CAL, SYM+I+G for ITS, K80+I+G for CHS-1, GTR+I+G for HIS3, and HKY+I for GAPDH and TUB2. The consensus tree from Bayesian analyses corroborated the tree topology obtained via parsimony, alongside bootstrap support. The analyses revealed 18 clades, which are accepted as representing different Colletotrichum species. More than half of all strains clustered in the first clade (C. karstii) with a bootstrap support of 96% and a Bayesian posterior probability of 1.00. Two single strain clades, representing C. phyllanthi and C. annellatum, grouped with this larger clade, showing bootstrap support/Bayesian posterior probability values of 96/0.99 and 100/1.00, respectively. The C. petchii clade was well supported (100/1.00) and formed a sister clade to the first three species. The clade for C. novae-zelandiae consisted of two strains on a long branch (100/1.00). Conversely, the subsequent five clades were short-branched: C. boninense s. str. (
C. brasiliense consists of three and two strains respectively, and they are well supported (100/1.00). They group (100/1.00) with a single strain clade (C. parsonsiae). The C. constrictum clade (100/1.00), containing two strains, and the single strain clade representing C. dacrycarpi are on very long branches and group with a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. The individual alignments and trees of the seven single genes were also compared with respect to their performance in species recognition. With ITS and CHS-1, only 7 and 9 species can be recognized. With TUB2, some species close to C. boninense cannot be separated, while with HIS3 and CAL, some species only differ in one or two base pairs and form no or only short-branched clades. With GAPDH, all clades are recognized, but some are also short-branched, especially the single strain clades C. beeveri and C. brassicicola, which are well differentiated with almost all other genes except for ITS. With ACT, the intraspecific variability is very high in some species, which could lead to misidentifications.
Taxonomy: The 86 isolates studied are assigned to 18 species within the Colletotrichum boninense complex based on DNA sequence data and morphology, including 12 species that are new to science. Ten species form teleomorph stages in vitro, four species have known anamorphs described in Colletotrichum, while one species, G. phyllanthi, has a known teleomorph and is shown here as belonging to the Colletotrichum boninense species complex. All species studied in culture are characterized below. Species of Colletotrichum represent anamorphic stages of Glomerella. Anamorph and teleomorph names of fungi will have equal status under the International Code of Nomenclature for algae, fungi, and plants (formerly the International Code for Botanical Nomenclature), with the deletion of Art. 59, which took effect on January 1, 2013. The decision was qualified by a stipulation that the uptake of names of anamorphic genera that predate well-known competing teleomorphic names should be ratified by a committee of the International Commission for the Taxonomy of Fungi. The name Colletotrichum (Corda 1831) predates Glomerella (Spauld. & H. Schrenk 1903) and is more commonly used. Consequently, we name the new holomorphs as species of Colletotrichum, and we do not name the new sexual morphs separately. Furthermore, G. phyllanthi is combined in Colletotrichum as C. phyllanthi. There is precedent for this, as Rojas et al. (2010) described Colletotrichum ignotum as having a teleomorph, although the teleomorphic structures were not included in the formal species diagnosis.
Colletotrichum annellatum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560734. Etymology: The name refers to the proliferation of conidiogenous cells, which appear annellate. The teleomorph developed on SNA. Ascomata are ovoid to obpyriform, medium to dark brown, measuring 180–220 × 100–150 µm, glabrous, ostiolate, with a neck that is hyaline to pale brown. The wall thickness is 5–10 µm, and the outer layer is composed of flattened, medium brown, angular cells, 5–10 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue consists of paraphyses, whic
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex exhibits ascospores that are 9 × 11–14 µm and 8-spored. The ascospores are arranged biseriately, hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, straight, or rarely very slightly curved, with both ends rounded. Their dimensions are (13.5–) 14.5–17(–19.5) × (5–) 5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.8 ± 1.4 × 5.8 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7. The anamorph develops on SNA, and the vegetative hyphae measure 1.5–9 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched.
Figure 1 presents one of the 958 most parsimonious trees obtained from a heuristic search of the combined ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, HIS3, TUB2, and CAL sequences alignment of the Colletotrichum boninense species complex. Bootstrap support values (500 replicates) above 70% (bold) and Bayesian posterior probability values above 0.95 are indicated at the nodes. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides CBS 112999 is used as the outgroup, with numbers of ex-type and ex-epitype strains emphasized in bold.
Figure 2 illustrates Colletotrichum annellatum (from ex-holotype strain CBS 129826). It includes images of conidiomata (A–B), conidiophores (C–E), the base of seta and conidiophores (F), tip of seta (G), conidiophores (H–I), conidia (J–K), ascomata (L–M), ascospores (N), paraphyses (O), asci (P–R), peridium in cross-section (S), and the outer surface of the peridium (T). Samples A, C–E, J are from Anthriscus stem, while B, F–I, K–T are from SNA. A–B and L were captured using a dissecting microscope (DM), while C–K and M–T utilized differential interference contrast illumination (DIC). Scale bars for images A and L are 100 µm, for M are 50 µm, and for C and N are 10 µm. The scale bar for A applies to A–B, the scale bar for C applies to C–K, and the scale bar for N applies to N–T.
Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were absent, with conidiophores and setae formed directly from vegetative hyphae or on a small cushion of hyaline to pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–6 µm in diameter. Setae were pale to medium brown, smooth to verruculose, especially towards the tip, 2–4-septate, and ranged from 70 to 160 µm long. The base was cylindrical, sometimes slightly inflated, measuring 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter, with the tip rounded. Conidiophores were hyaline to very pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 80 µm long. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline to very pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 4–22 × 4–5 µm, with openings 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette less than 0.5 µm long, exhibiting distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar. The contents were granular or guttulate, often with two large guttules, measuring (11.5–) 13–15(–15.5) × (5–)5.5–6 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.0 ± 0.9 × 5.7 ± 0.2 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.4. Appressoria were rare (only eight observed), single, medium brown, roundish, elliptical, or with a bullet-shaped outline, having an entire to undulate margin, measuring 5.5–9(–11) × (4–)4.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.3 ± 1.6 × 5.7 ± 1.0 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.3. The anamorph was found on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata were acervular, with conidiophores formed on a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells, measuring 5–10 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores were pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 35 µm long. Conidiogenous cells were pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, with annellations frequently observed, measuring 7–21 × 3.5–5 µm, with openings 1.5–2 µm in diameter and a collarette measuring 0.5–1 µm long. Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar. The contents were granular or guttulate, often with two large guttules, measuring (13–)14–15.5(–16.5) × 5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.7 ± 1.0 × 5.8 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA were flat with an entire margin, hyaline to pale honey-colored. On medium with Anthriscus stem and filter paper, they were partly covered with short floccose, white aerial mycelium and grey to black conidiomata; the reverse exhibited the same colors, measuring 17.5–19.5 mm in 7 days (28–29.5 mm in 10 days). C
From its description, G. heveae belongs to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate; it has conidia that measure 12–17 × 3.5–5 µm (i.e., narrower than those of C. annellatum) and conidiogenous cells (“basidia”) measuring 20–34 × 2 µm. Typification of neither species is easy. The only potential type material of either species in K contains a single packet labeled in Petch’s handwriting with “Gloeosporium brunneum Petch & Colletotrichum heveae Petch, no. 2228. On Hevea, 7 Oct. 1905; type of Colletotrichum heveae.” The packet contains two young leaves, apparently with only one fungus, corresponding to the description of G. heveae rather than C. heveae. The name G. brunneum Petch was apparently never published (it would be a later homonym of G. brunneum Ellis & Everh. 1889), and it seems most likely that Petch changed the name of this species between collection and publication. Petch’s names cannot therefore be unequivocally typified, but it seems certain that neither provides an earlier name for C. annellatum. Most Colletotrichum isolates derived from Hevea plants have been found to belong to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes. However, one isolate from Hevea guianensis in Peru has an ITS sequence placing it in the C. boninense species complex, within C. karstii or C. phyllanthi. The ITS sequence of C. annelatum differs in two bp from C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Further research is needed to clarify the placement of the strain from Peru.
Colletotrichum beeveri Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560735. Etymology: Named after Ross Beever, New Zealand mycologist and fungal geneticist, who collected the plant material from which this species was isolated. Teleomorph not observed. On SNA, Anthriscus stem/filter paper and OA, closed round structures were observed that could be undeveloped ascomata; neither conidia nor ascospores were produced. Anamorph developed on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1.5–7 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, while conidiophores and setae are formed directly from vegetative hyphae or on pale brown, thick-walled angular cells measuring 3–6.5 µm in diameter. Setae are dark brown, smooth-walled, 1–3-septate, 50–100 µm long, with a base that is conical to slightly inflated, measuring 5–6.5 µm in diameter, and the tip is slightly acute. Conidiophores are pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 9–30 × 3.5–6.5 µm, with an opening of 1–1.5 µm in diameter, a collarette ≤ 0.5 µm long, and distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, granular or guttulate contents, often with two large guttules, measuring (11.5–)12–14(–16) × 5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.2 ± 1.0 × 6.0 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.2. Appressoria are single, dark brown, irregular but often elliptical to navicular in outline, with lobate margins, measuring (5.5–)7.5–12.5(–14.5) × (4–)5.5–8.5(–9) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.1 ± 2.5 × 7.1 ± 1.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.4.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata acervular, conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of medium brown, thick-walled angular cells, 3–10 µm in diameter. Setae (only a few observed at the margin of acervuli) dark brown, smooth-walled, 2–3-septate, 80–95 µm long, base conical to cylindrical, 4.5–6 µm in diameter, tip roundish to ± acute. Conidiophores pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, up to 20 µm long. Conidiogenous cells pale to medium brown, smooth-walled, short cylindrical to ampulliform, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 9–15 × 4.5–5.5 µm, with openings 1–1.5 µm in diameter, collarette < 0.5 µm long, and periclinal thickening distinct. Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, possessing a prominent scar, contents granular or guttulate, sometimes with two large guttules, measuring (12.5–)12–14(–15.5) × 5.5–6.5 µm, mean ± SD = 14.3± 0.8 × 6.0± 0.4 µm, L/W ratio = 2.4.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, hyaline, with filter paper, Anthriscus stem, and partly agar medium covered with orange to black conidiomata, and filter paper partly with white mycelium; reverse hyaline with black spots mainly under the filter paper, measuring 22.5–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–37 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with entire margins, buff, primrose to greenish olivaceous with orange, dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata, partly with short floccose white aerial mycelium; reverse buff, pale purplish grey, primrose, greenish olivaceous to iron-grey with olivaceous grey spots due to conidiomata/ascomata shining through, measuring 26.5–29 mm in 7 days (39–40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are salmon to orange.
Material examined: New Zealand, Great Barrier Island, from brown lesions on a leaf of Brachyglottis repanda, R.E. Beever, 23 Mar. 2006, (CBS H-20694 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128527 = ICMP 18594). Notes: This species is characterized by wide conidia and complex appressoria. It forms a sister group to C. brassicicola (from Brassica, also from New Zealand) and C. colombiense (from Passiflora leaves in Colombia), which have similarly sized and shaped conidia. It differs from C. colombiense by its acute, ± smooth-walled setae and its more elongate conidiogenous cells. In common with C. brassicicola, C. beeveri can produce pycnidium-like structures in culture, but none produced spores. No species of Colletotrichum has been previously described from Brachyglottis, and none of those species described from members of the Asteraceae originate from Australasia. According to sequence comparisons with six genes, C. beeveri (identified as C. boninense) was isolated as an endophyte of healthy roots of Pleione bulbocodioides (Orchidaceae) in China. Several endophytic strains from Podocarpaceae leaves from New Zealand have the same or similar ITS sequences as C. beeveri.

Teleomorph developed on OA (CBS 123756). Ascomata perithecia are variable in shape but usually subglobose to pyriform, glabrous, medium brown, measuring 100–300 × 100–200 µm, ostiolate, periphysate, with a hyaline to pale brown neck up to 100 µm in length. The outer wall is composed of flattened angular cells 4–15 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue consists of rather irregular thin-walled hyaline septate paraphyses. Asci are arranged in a basal fascicle, cylindric-clavate, measuring 45–60 × 12.5–17 µm, 8-spored, with a ± truncate apex and a small refractive apical ring. Ascospores are initially hyaline and aseptate, later becoming 1–3-septate, with septation sometimes occurring inside the ascus. They are light to medium brown-pigmented, sometimes verruculose prior to germination, allantoid, measuring (12.5–)14–17(–18) × (4–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.6 ± 1.4 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9. Anamorph developed on SNA (CBS 123755). Vegetative hyphae are 1–6 µm in diameter, hyaline or pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are poorly or not developed, with conidiophores and setae formed directly on hyphae. Setae are rare, medium brown, smooth to verruculose, 1–2-septate, measuring 20–60 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated base 3–7 µm in diameter at the widest part, and a ± rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline or pale brown, simple or septate, branched or unbranched, up to 40 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline or pale brown, cylindrical, measuring 6–15 × 3–5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette of 0.5–1.5 µm long, exhibiting conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a round apex and base featuring a prominent hilum, often containing two large polar guttules, measuring (8.5–)11–14.5(–17.5) × (4–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.8 ± 1.6 × 5.4 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.4. Appressoria are solitary or in short chains, medium brown, thick-walled, with entire or crenate edges, rarely lobate, smooth-walled, and irregularly shaped, often bullet-shaped or navicular with an acute tip, measuring (4.5–)7–14(–18) × (4–)5–8(–11) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.5 ± 3.3 × 6.4 ± 1.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.6. Anamorph developed on Anthriscus stem (CBS 123755). Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of pale brown, roundish to angular cells, measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are rare, medium brown, with a basal cell often paler, verruculose, 1–2-septate, measuring 30–70 µm long, with a cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated base 3.5–6.5 µm in diameter, and a tip that is ± round to ± acute. Conidiophores are pal
MAFF 306094. Australia, from Leucospermum sp., culture CBS 129831. New Zealand, Northland, Kaipara, from flowers of Solanum betaceum, 1 Feb. 2004, M. Manning, culture CBS 128549. Notes: Conidia of C. boninense are similar to those of C. karstii, although the ascospores of C. boninense are more uniform with rounded ends, becoming brown and septate with age, and the asci are longer and wider. We recognize that there is significant genetic variation in C. boninense. Host plants of C. boninense s. str. are very diverse, including Amaryllidaceae, Bignoniaceae, Podocarpaceae, Proteaceae, Solanaceae, and Theaceae. Several ITS sequences, for example HM044131 from Oryza granulata and FJ449913 from Dendrobium sp., both presumably from China, are similar to the ITS of C. boninense, C. oncidii, and C. cymbidiicola, but these species cannot be separated from each other by comparison of ITS sequences.
Colletotrichum brasiliense Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous & Massola, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560736. Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Brazil. Teleomorph not observed. Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–5.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, approximately thin-walled, angular cells measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. However, in strain CBS 128528, conidiophores and setae are formed directly on hyphae. Setae are sparse, pale to medium brown, with the basal cell usually paler, smooth to finely verruculose, 2–4-septate, measuring 50–60 µm long. The base is cylindrical to conical, 6–8 µm in diameter, and the tip is approximately acute to slightly roundish or zigzag-shaped. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ellipsoidal, encased in a mucous sheath, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–14 × 4.5–7.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter, a visible collarette of ≤ 0.5 µm long, and visible periclinal thickening. In strain CBS 128528, conidiogenous cells are longer (12–25 µm) and the periclinal thickening is conspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, and granular or guttulate contents, measuring (11.5–)13–16(–18) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 1.6 × 5.4 ± 0.2 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.7. Conidia of strain CBS 128528 are longer, measuring (13.5–)14–19(–22.5) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.5 ± 2.4 × 5.3 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.1. Appressoria are medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, lobed, often with a roundish outline, sometimes triangular, measuring (5.5–)7–16(–32) × (4–)6.5–13(–24) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.5 ± 4.5 × 9.7 ± 3.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.2. Anamorph on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells, 3–8 µm in diameter. Setae (only one observed) are medium brown, smooth-walled, 3-septate, measuring 65 µm long, with a cylindrical base of 4.5 µm in diameter and a tip that is approximately acute and zigzag-shaped. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, up to 20 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ellipsoidal, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, mea
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex is characterized by conidia that are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and cylindrical, with rounded apex and base and a prominent scar. The contents are granular or guttulate, measuring (13–)13.5–16(–19) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.8 ± 1.3 × 5.3 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in an L/W ratio of 2.8. The conidia from strain CBS 128528 are longer, measuring (13–)14–19(–22.5) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.7 ± 2.5 × 5.1 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.3.
Culture characteristics show colonies on SNA that are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, and pale cinnamon, resembling Anthriscus stems. On Anthriscus stems, the colonies are covered with orange to black conidiomata. Filter paper appears partly rosy buff and grey to black, covered with white mycelium and grey to black conidiomata; the reverse exhibits similar colors, with black spots mainly under the filter paper, measuring 21–21.5 mm in 7 days (32.5–33.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, buff in color, and greenish olivaceous towards the center with orange to black conidiomata, lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse is buff, grey olivaceous to olivaceous grey towards the center, measuring 21.5 mm in 7 days (32–33.5 mm in 10 days). The conidia in mass are orange.
Material examined includes samples from Brazil, Sao Paulo, Bauru City, collected from fruit anthracnose of Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa on June 1, 2006, by N. Massola and H.J. Tozze Jr. The holotype is CBS H-20697, with the culture ex-type being CBS 128501 = ICMP 18607 = PAS12. Additional samples from the same location include fruit of Passiflora edulis, with CBS H-20696 and culture CBS 128528 = ICMP 18606 = PAS10.
Notes: There are four species in the C. boninense species complex known to occur on Passiflora: C. brasiliense from Brazil (on fruits), C. colombiense from Colombia (on leaves), C. torulosum from New Zealand (on leaves), and C. karstii from Japan and Colombia (on leaves) as well as Brazil (on fruits). According to Johnston & Jones (1997), C. gloeosporioides Group E (= C. novae-zelandiae) and C. gloeosporioides Group I (= C. constrictum) have also been isolated from Passiflora, though this has not been confirmed by molecular methods. At this stage, Colletotrichum brasiliense and C. colombiense are known only from Passiflora. Colletotrichum brasiliense, which causes anthracnose of yellow passion fruit (Passiflora edulis f. flavicarpa), is closely related to C. parsonsiae and C. hippeastri. It is distinguished from these species by most genes, including ITS, although the CHS-1 sequence of one isolate was the same as that of C. parsonsii. Appressoria have a lower L/W ratio (1.2) than other species in this group. Numerous records of Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium, and Glomerella species on Passiflora exist (Farr & Rossman 2011).
Two Colletotrichum and two Gloeosporium species have previously been described from Passiflora. Gloeosporium passiflorae Speg., described from Passiflora sp. in Argentina, forms longer conidia (20–30 × 5–6 µm) than any of the species in the C. boninense species complex known from Passiflora. Conidia of C. passiflorae Siemaszko, described on leaves of Passiflora edulis in Transcaucasia (now part of Armenia, Azerbaijan, and Georgia), are smaller, measuring 14–25 × 4–6 µm. Most species discussed have shorter conidia, with only C. brasiliense isolate CBS showing longer measurements.
Sometimes exceeding 20 µm, the average length of certain structures is 16.5 µm, with an L/W ratio of 3.3, rather than the 3.5–4.25 range suggested by Siemaszko’s measurements. Colletotrichum passiflorae F. Stevens & P.A. Young, described on fruits of P. laurifolia and leaves of P. edulis from Hawaii, U.S.A., might be an earlier name for several species within the boninense complex. However, von Arx treated it as a synonym of the gloeosporioides complex. Its description—“Acervuli black, numerous, 90–225 µm in diameter. Setae brown, 50–75 by 5 µm. Conidia granular, cylindrical, 11–18 by 3.5–6 µm” (Stevens 1925)—is inadequate for assessing its identity. The setae of C. constrictum, C. novae-zelandiae, C. karstii, and C. torulosum are longer than those quoted for C. passiflorae by Stevens, but different growth conditions make such comparisons unreliable. No living cultures of C. passiflorae seem to have been maintained, leading us to regard the name as uncertain. It is not available for any species of the C. boninense complex as it is a later homonym of C. passiflorae Siemaszko. The name Gloeosporium passifloricola Sawada [as “passifloricolum”] was introduced for a fungus on Passiflora quadrangularis in Taiwan, but the name was invalidly published and cannot threaten any species discussed in our paper.
Colletotrichum brassicicola Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560737. Etymology: Named after the host plant genus, Brassica. The teleomorph developed on Anthriscus stems. The ascomata are globose to subglobose, pale brown, measuring 100–250 × 90–150 µm, glabrous, ostiolate, with a hyaline to pale brown neck. The outer wall consists of flattened angular cells sized 8–19.5 × 5.5–15.5 µm. The interascal tissue is made up of paraphyses; hyaline, septate, branched, measuring 55–100 × 4–8 µm. Asci are cylindrical, 65–105 × 12–13.5 µm, and 8-spored. Ascospores (only 7 observed) are arranged biseriately, hyaline and aseptate, fusiform, sometimes broader on one side or slightly curved, smooth, measuring (15–)17.3–21(–24) × (3.5–)4–5.5(–7) µm, with a mean ± SD of 19.1 ± 1.8 × 4.8 ± 0.8 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.0. On filter paper, ascospores measure (16.5–)18–22.5(–23.5) × 4.5–5.5(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 20.3 ± 2.4 × 5.1 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 4.0. The anamorph developed on SNA, with vegetative hyphae measuring 1–5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were poorly developed, with conidiophores and setae formed directly on hyphae. Setae are medium brown, verruculose, 1–3-septate, measuring
Anamorph developed on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata acervular, conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of hyaline to pale brown, angular cells, 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, with the base often paler, smooth to verruculose, 1–2-septate, 25–60 µm long, with a cylindrical to conical base that is often slightly inflated, measuring 4–7.5 µm in diameter, and a rounded tip. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, and up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, clavate to ellipsoidal, measuring 5–16 × 3.5–5 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter and a collarette 0.5–1 µm long, with visible to conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to clavate, with a round apex and a round base featuring a prominent scar, guttulate, and sometimes containing one or two large guttules, measuring (9–)11.5–13.5(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–6 µm, mean ± SD = 12.4 ± 1 × 5.6 ± 0.3 µm, with an L/W ratio of 2.2. On filter paper (less often observed on Anthriscus stem), dark brown to black, roundish closed conidiomata are formed, up to 400 µm in diameter, opening by irregular rupture. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, and irregularly shaped, possibly deformed due to pressure inside the conidiomata, measuring (7.5–)10–14.5(–18) × (4.5–)5–7(–8.5) µm, mean ± SD = 12.2 ± 2.3 × 6.2 ± 0.9 µm, with an L/W ratio of 2.0.
Culture characteristics include colonies on SNA that are flat with an entire margin, hyaline with felty white aerial mycelium on Anthriscus stem and filter paper, and salmon to orange acervuli with black sclerotia/ascomata on filter paper; the reverse on filter paper is rosy buff to hazel, with black sclerotia/ascomata shining through, measuring 17.5–21 mm in 7 days (27.5–31.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is buff, pale luteous to greenish olivaceous, partly covered with olivaceous grey structures and orange spore masses, featuring felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, with the reverse being honey-colored, pale luteous to isabelline, measuring 19–22.5 mm in 7 days (29–32.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Material examined includes a sample from New Zealand, Manawatu-Wanganui, Ohakune, from a leaf spot of Brassica oleracea var. gemmifera, collected in July 1998 (deposited in CBS collection), identified by B. Thrupp (CBS H-20698 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 101059 = LYN 16331). Notes indicate that the conidia of C. brassicicola are very short, while ascospores and asci are longer than those of the other four species in the C. boninense species complex with a known sexual morph. Farr & Rossman (2011) list six Colletotrichum taxa associated with Brassica species: C. truncatum, C. capsici (treated as a synonym of C. truncatum by
Colletotrichum brassicicola (from ex-holotype strain CBS 101059) is described as follows:
Samples A, C–E, P, R–S, U–Z are from Anthriscus stem. Samples B, F–O, Q are from SNA. Sample T is from filter paper. A–B, R are from DM, while C–Q, T–Z are from DIC. The scale bars are as follows: A, R = 100 µm; S = 50 µm; D, T = 10 µm. The scale bar of A applies to A–B, the scale bar of D applies to C–Q, and the scale bar of T applies to T–Z.
An isolate on Passiflora sp. from Colombia (Pass-65, Afanador Kafuri et al. 2003) has the same ITS sequence as C. brassicicola, while isolates from leaves of Podocarpus totara and Prumnopitys ferruginea in New Zealand (Joshee et al. 2009) differ by only two or three substitutions in ITS sequences. We cannot be sure whether these strains belong to C. brassicicola or to other segregates of the C. boninense group.
Colletotrichum colombiense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560738. Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Colombia. The teleomorph was not observed, but on OA, spherical structures were noted on the agar surface and within the medium that lacked any conidia or ascospores. The anamorph was found on SNA.
Vegetative hyphae measured 1–6 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were absent, with conidiophores forming directly from vegetative hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores were hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, measuring up to 50 µm long.
Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and sometimes slightly inflated, surrounded by several mucous layers. These cells often extended to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–18 × 3.5–5 µm, with an opening diameter of 1–1.5 µm; collarette and periclinal thickening were not observed.
Conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, and granular or guttulate contents, often with two large guttules, measuring (11.5–)12–14(–15.5) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.1 ± 1.0 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.3.
Appressoria were single, medium to dark brown, roundish to elliptical, with an undulate to lobate margin, measuring (5.5–)6–10(–12.5) × (3.5–)4.5–7.5(–10) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.8 ± 2.0 × 6.0 ± 1.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3. The appressoria of strain CBS 129817 were larger, measuring (7–)7.5–14.5(–21.5) × (5–)6–10(–12.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.0 ± 3.5 × 8.1 ± 1.9 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3.
Conidia. A, C–G, P. from Anthriscus stem. B, H–K, Q. from SNA. A–B. DM, C–Q. DIC, Scale bars: A = 100 µm, E = 10 µm. Scale bar of A applies to A–B. Scale bar of E applies to C–Q.
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex is characterized by isabelline conidiomata, partly covered with salmon, grey to black coloration, and lacking aerial mycelium. The reverse side is buff to olivaceous grey, measuring 26–26.5 mm after 7 days (37–39 mm in 10 days). The conidia appear in mass with a salmon hue.
Material examined includes specimens from Colombia, specifically Cundinamarca, Tibacuy, collected from a leaf of Passiflora edulis on January 22, 2010, by D. Riascos (CBS H-20699 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129818 = G2) and from another leaf of Passiflora edulis on November 5, 2009, also by D. Riascos (CBS H-20700, culture CBS 129817 = G1).
Notes indicate that sequences of C. colombiense form a sister group to C. beeveri and C. brassicicola. It differs from C. beeveri in morphology by having verrucose and rounded setae, as well as shorter conidiogenous cells. Other species isolated from Passiflora exhibit pigmented conidiogenous cells (such as C. brasiliense and C. karstii) or more complex appressoria (like C. torulosum). For discussions on previously published Colletotrichum taxa associated with Passiflora, refer to C. brasiliense. Many other isolates from Passiflora sp. in the study by Afanador-Kafuri et al. (2003) have the same or similar ITS sequence as C. colombiense, but cannot be identified based on ITS alone due to the close relationship of the three species.
Colletotrichum constrictum Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560739. Etymology: The name refers to the shape of the ascospores, which are often constricted. The teleomorph was found on SNA. The ascomata are perithecia, formed after 4 weeks, solitary, non-stromatic, ovoid to obpyriform, ostiolate, glabrous, and medium brown, measuring 120–200 × 90–150 µm. The peridium is 6–10 µm thick, composed of medium brown, flattened angular cells, with a diameter of 7–15 µm. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, delicate, and rarely visible. The interascal tissue is formed of paraphyses, which are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly cylindrical but tapering towards the rounded tip, disintegrating quickly, septate, branched, very variable, slightly constricted at the septa, apically free, measuring 40–95 × 5–7 µm. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering at both ends, measuring 50–95 × 15–20 µm, with a broadly truncate base. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, almost straight, with bases and apices uniformly broadly rounded, often constricted in the center, making them broadest close to the ends, measuring (14–)16–20(–23) × (6–)6.5–8(–9) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.9 ± 2.1 × 7.1 ± 0.7 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.5.
The teleomorph found on Anthriscus stem shows ascomata that are perithecia, formed after 4 weeks. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering at both ends, smooth-walled, measuring 60–75 × 15–17 µm, with a broadly truncate base. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, and smooth-walled, sharing t
Conidiomata are absent, with conidiophores and setae formed directly from vegetative hyphae or from a reduced cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–9 µm in diameter. Setae are pale to medium brown, verruculose, 1–4-septate, and range from 65 to 130 µm in length; the base is cylindrical, sometimes slightly inflated, with a diameter of 4.5–6.5 µm and a tip that is approximately acute. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, aseptate or septate, branched, and can reach up to 70 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–20 × 3–7.5 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette ≤ 0.5 µm. The periclinal thickening is distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent scar, and have granular contents measuring (8.5–)12–15(–16) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.3 ± 1.5 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.3. In strain CBS 128503, occasionally, globose to subglobose conidia are observed, measuring 9–13 × 7–13 µm. Appressoria are single or in small groups of 2–3, medium to dark brown, smooth-walled, ovate, bullet-shaped, navicular, or clavate in outline, with undulate to lobate margins, measuring (5–)7.5–12(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–7.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 9.7 ± 2.4 × 6.5 ± 1.1 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem exhibits acervular conidiomata, with conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of pale brown, thick-walled, angular cells measuring 2.5–8 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, with the basal cell often paler, verruculose, 2–4-septate, measuring 70–150 µm in length; the base is cylindrical, conical to approximately inflated, with a diameter of 3.5–6.5 µm and an acute tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, aseptate or septate, branched, and can be up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 7–15 × 3.5–7 µm, with an opening of 1–2 µm in diameter and a collarette less than 0.5 µm long, with distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with a round apex and base featuring a prominent hilum; the contents appear granular to guttulate, measuring (13–)14–15.5(–16) × 5–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 0.7 × 5.4 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
Culture characteristics indicate that colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, and pale cinnamon, resembling the Anthriscus stem, which is covered with orange to black conidiomata and ascomata. Filter paper is partly rosy buff, grey to black, and covered with white mycelium along with grey to black conidiomata/ascomata; the reverse displays the same colors, with black spots mainly beneath the filter paper, measuring 15–21 mm in 7 days (30.5–32.5 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin, rosy buff, olivaceous to black with dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata, and orange in the
In blastn searches, no ITS sequence was found with more than 96% identity; matches with other genes were ≤ 93% identical. The lack of matches may indicate that Colletotrichum constrictum has a restricted distribution. Colletotrichum constrictum was previously referred to as C. gloeosporioides group I by Johnston & Jones (1997) and is only known from New Zealand. Isolates studied here are from Citrus sp. and Solanum betaceum. According to Johnston & Jones (1997), the species also occurs on Passiflora edulis and P. mollissima, although this has not been confirmed by molecular methods.
The figure illustrates various structures of Colletotrichum constrictum from ex-holotype strain CBS 128504. It includes images of conidiomata, conidiophores, and appressoria, showcasing their respective tips and bases, as well as details of conidia and ascomata. The images are labeled with scale bars to indicate dimensions, where applicable.
Colletotrichum cymbidiicola Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. (MycoBank MB560740) is named after the host plant, Cymbidium. The teleomorph on SNA features ascomata that are solitary, semi-immersed or immersed, non-stromatic, and vary in shape from subspherical to ovoid. They are medium brown, with specific measurements provided for perithecia and peridium thickness. Asci are unitunicate and contain biseriately arranged ascospores that are aseptate, fusiform, and smooth-walled.
The anamorph on SNA shows vegetative hyphae that are hyaline and smooth-walled, with conidiophores and setae originating from the medium. Setae are medium brown and verruculose, while conidiophores are hyaline and smooth-walled. Detailed dimensions are provided for each structure, highlighting the characteristics of the species, including its conidia, which are aseptate and cylindrical, with specific measurements indicating their dimensions and shape.
Appressoria are medium to dark brown, with a highly variable outline; the margin is lobate, occurring singly or in loose groups, measuring (6.5–)8–14.5(–18.5) × (3.5–)4.5–8(–11.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.2 ± 3.2 × 6.3 ± 1.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.8. The anamorph is found on Anthriscus stems. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown angular cells measuring 3–8 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, verruculose to verrucose, 1–4-septate, and range from 75 to 180 µm in length, with a cylindrical to strongly inflated base of 4–10 µm in diameter, and a tip that is ± rounded to ± acute. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 8–13 × 5.5–7 µm, with an opening of 1.5–2 µm in diameter, a collarette of ≤ 0.5 µm in diameter, and a conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, a prominent scar, and contents that are guttulate, measuring (11.5–)13.5–15.5(–16.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 0.9 × 5.7 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.6.
Culture characteristics show colonies on SNA as flat with an entire margin, hyaline to honey in color, partly covered with floccose-felty white aerial mycelium. Anthriscus stems and filter paper are partially covered with grey to black conidiomata that are partly oozing salmon to orange conidia; the reverse is hyaline to honey, with filter paper showing grey to black spots from conidiomata shining through, measuring 25–26.5 mm in 7 days (37.5–40 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA appear flat with an entire margin, buff to straw in color, and sectors covered either with granular white aerial mycelium or black conidiomata, oozing salmon to orange conidia; the reverse is buff, straw, honey, isabelline, olivaceous grey to iron-grey, measuring 25–27.5 mm in 7 days (40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are salmon to orange.
Material examined includes: Australia, Western Australia, Perth, Fremantle, from leaf lesions of Cymbidium sp., on 27 Mar. 1991, by P.M. Wood (CBS H-20703 holotype, culture ex type IMI 34
Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, with rounded apex and base. They have a guttulate content, measuring (17–)18.5–21.5(–22.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 19.9 ± 1.7 × 5.7 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in a length/width ratio of 3.5. Appressoria were not observed after 3 weeks.
Colletotrichum cymbidiicola was examined from the ex-holotype strain IMI 347923. The study presented various figures, including conidiomata, tips and bases of setae, conidiophores, and asci among other structures. Specific scale bars were noted for clarity in the images.
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex was studied on Anthriscus stem. The conidiomata were globose, opening by rupture, with wall cells that are medium brown and angular, measuring 7–20 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed. The conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched, reaching up to 50 µm in length. They develop from a cushion of medium brown, angular to rounded cells, which are 3.5–12 µm in diameter. The conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, and surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, measuring 7.5–23 × 3–5 µm, with openings of 1.5–2.5 µm in diameter. No collarette was observed, but periclinal thickening was noted.
Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical, with a round apex and base, containing granular to guttulate content, measuring (13–)15.5–19.5(–24) × 5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.3 ± 2.0 × 5.5 ± 0.3 µm, resulting in a length/width ratio of 3.2.
Culture characteristics indicated that colonies on SNA were flat with entire margins, ranging in color from hyaline to honey-colored, exhibiting white floccose aerial mycelium and grey structures with orange conidial masses at the center. The reverse side was hyaline to honey-colored with pale salmon, displaying dark grey spots due to conidiomata or ascomata. The growth measured 10.5–12.5 mm in 7 days (17.5–20 mm in 10 days).
On OA, colonies were flat with entire margins, appearing rosy buff to pale flesh with a buff margin, covered with sepia to black conidiomata or ascomata and orange conidia masses at the center, with very sparse white aerial mycelium. The reverse side was buff to rosy buff, measuring 11–12.5 mm in 7 days (16–17.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia appeared orange in mass.
Material examined was collected in New Zealand, Auckland, Wenderholm Regional Park, from a leaf endophyte of Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (kahikatea) on 16 Oct. 2009 by G. Carroll, designated as the holotype (CBS H-20705, culture ex-type CBS 130241 = ICMP 19107). Notably, prior to this study, no Colletotrichum species had been described from Dacrycarpus species (Podocarpaceae).
Colletotrichum dacrycarpi does not exhibit typical characteristics of the genus, as it shows slow growth and produces conidia within closed fruit bodies that rupture. These closed fruit bodies are similar to those observed in several other species within the C. boninense complex. The extension of conidiogenous cells to form new conidiogenous loci is a characteristic feature of species in this complex. Colletotrichum dacrycarpi is one of the most basal members of the clade and forms a s

Conidiomata acervular, conidiophores and setae formed from a cushion of medium brown, angular to rounded cells, 3.5–12 µm in diameter. Setae pale brown, darker towards the base, smooth and very thick-walled, 1–6-septate, the septa concentrated towards the base, 50–150 µm long, the base cylindrical, conical, or inflated, 5.5–10 µm in diameter, the tip rounded. Conidiophores pale to medium brown, septate, branched, to 70 µm long. Conidiogenous cells sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, pale to medium brown, smooth, cylindrical, the upper part surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, 12–28 × 4.5–5.5 µm, the opening 1.5–2 µm in diameter, collarette and periclinal thickening not observed. Conidia hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, apex round, base round, granular content, (14.5–)18.5–30(–39) × (5–)6–8(–9) µm, mean ± SD = 24.2 ± 5.8 × 6.9 ± 0.9 µm, L/W ratio = 3.5. Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA flat with fimbriate margin (individual hyphae visible at the margin), hyaline with floccose white to very pale grey aerial mycelium on Anthriscus stem and filter paper medium, with black structures visible in the center and on Anthriscus stem; 29–34 mm in 7 days (35–38 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA flat with entire margin; surface covered with floccose pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, mainly at the margin, and grey to black structures, mainly in the center; reverse smoke grey to olivaceous grey; 30–33 mm in 7 days (40 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass salmon to orange. Growth rates for CBS 125377 are SNA: 28 mm in 7 days (37 mm in 10 days), OA: SNA: 30.8 mm in 7 days (40 mm in 10 days). Material examined: China, Guizhou Province, Guiyang, isolated from the leaf of Hippeastrum vittatum, 23 May 2009, Y.L. Yang, culture ex-holotype CBS 125376. Netherlands, isolated from the leaf of Hippeastrum sp., deposited in CBS from Plantenziektenkundige Dienst Wageningen in May 1978, culture CBS 241.78. Notes: Colletotrichum hippeastri is an outlying species in the C. boninense clade and is distinguished from related species by its large conidia as well as elongate and complex appressoria. A feature that is common with others of the complex is conidiogenous cells that are covered in a gelatinous sheath. Phylogenetically, Colletotrichum hippeastri is noteworthy.
Appressoria. M–N. Conidia. A, C–F, M. from Anthriscus stem. B, F–L, N. from SNA. A–B. DM, C–N. DIC, Scale bars: A = 100 µm, B = 200 µm, C = 10 µm. Scale bar of C applies to C–Q. The Colletotrichum boninense species complex shows 23 informative sequence differences that were not detected in the strains studied, and the species forms a distinct cluster within all single gene phylogenies. All isolates of C. hippeastri are from Hippeastrum, a genus of bulb-forming plants native to tropical and subtropical regions of the Americas, ranging from Argentina north to Mexico and the Caribbean. Strain CBS 119185 from Hippeastrum sp. in Brazil, which was unfortunately lost, is the only record of C. hippeastri from the Americas, as determined by the ITS sequence generated by Farr et al. (2006). Isolates included in this study are from China and the Netherlands. Colletotrichum karstii Y.L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Cryptogamie Mycologie 32: 241, 2011. Fig. 12. Teleomorph on SNA. Ascomata perithecia, formed after 4 weeks, are solitary, superficial or immersed in the agar medium, non-stromatic, globose to obpyriform, ostiolate, periphysate, glabrous, medium brown, paler towards the ostiole, measuring 90–130 × 90–200 µm, with a neck up to 90 µm, but usually much shorter. The peridium is 6–10 µm thick, composed of 3–5 layers of pale to medium brown flattened textura angularis with cells 3.5–12 µm in diameter. Ascogenous hyphae are hyaline, smooth, delicate, and rarely visible. Interascal tissue is formed of paraphyses, which are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly cylindrical but tapering towards the round tip, disintegrating quickly, septate, constricted at the septa, apically free, measuring 30–50 × 4.5–7 µm. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering to the apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 37–56 × 9–12 µm (asci of isolate CBS 128550 can be up to 65 µm long), with a broadly truncate base and a basal septum of 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter. Ascospores are uni- or biseriately arranged, initially aseptate but often septate with age, hyaline, smooth-walled, variable in shape, fusiform to ovoid, slightly curved, measuring (11.5–)13–16.5(–18.5) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.7 ± 1.8 × 5.0 ± 0.7 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.9. Ascospores of isolate CBS 128550 are larger, measuring (14.5–)16–18(–18.5) × (3.5–)4.5–6(–6.5) µm. The teleomorph on PDA shows ascomata that are approximately globose to obpyriform, measuring up to 275 µm in diameter, ostiolate, periphysate, and reddish brown; the outer wall is composed of irregular reddish brown polyhedral cells measuring 10–20 µm in diamete

Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, with rounded apex and base, featuring a prominent hilum of approximately 1 µm in diameter and less than 0.3 µm long. The contents appear granular, with dimensions of (11.5–)12.5–14(–14.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, mean ± SD = 13.1 ± 0.7 × 5.8 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.2. Conidia of CBS 111998 can be longer (up to 18.5 µm, L/W ratio = 2.8). Appressoria are single or in small groups of 2–3, pale to medium brown, often navicular to bullet-shaped, smooth-walled to undulate, measuring (4.5–)6–12(–16.5) × (2.5–)4–7(–10) µm, with mean ± SD = 8.9 ± 2.9 × 5.4 ± 1.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.7. Appressoria of CBS 129833 are larger, measuring (5.5–)7.5–13(–17) × (4.5–)5.5–8.5(–10.5) µm, mean ± SD = 10.3 ± 2.6 × 7.1 ± 1.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.4. The anamorph is found on Anthriscus stems.

Yarez-Morales, CBS H-20714, culture CBS 129833; Cooitepec Harinas, from fruit anthracnose of Annona cherimola, 1 July 2003, R. Villanueva-Arce, culture CBS 128550 = ICMP 17896. Notes: Based on sequence comparison with six genes (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, TUB2, CHS-1), 46 of the isolates in this study group with C. karstii (not shown). Colletotrichum karstii was recently described from a leaf of Vanda sp. (Orchidaceae) in China and reported on several other orchids (Yang et al. 2011). It occurs on many host plants and is the most common and geographically diverse species in the C. boninense complex. Colletotrichum karstii was referred to as C. gloeosporioides groups F and G by Johnston & Jones (1997), who also listed Persea americana and Cucurbita spp. as host plants. Many earlier works have cited isolates of C. boninense that are identified here as C. karstii, including some of those detailed in the original description (Morikawi et al. 2003), some in Farr et al. (2006), and all those in Lubbe et al. (2004). Some isolates from Passiflora edulis in Brazil that caused anthracnose on passion fruits (Tozze et al. 2010) were identified as C. karstii by GAPDH sequences. ITS sequences of endophytic strains of C. gloeosporioides “group 2” from Musa acuminata from Thailand (Photita et al. 2005), as well as C. boninense isolates from Persea americana from Mexico (Silva-Rojas & Ávila-Quezada 2011), Maytenus ilicifolia from Brazil (Pileggi et al. 2009), and Passiflora sp. in Florida, U.S.A. (Tarnowski & Ploetz 2010), are identical or similar to those of C. karstii (and C. phyllanthi).
Sequence and morphological variability is high, with differences in conidium size and conidiomatal structures ranging from sporodochial to acervular to closed. This makes identification difficult if based on morphology alone. The conidia of C. karstii are smaller than those of C. hippeastri and C. dracaenae, and broader than those of C. phyllanthi. The asci are shorter than those of C. brassicicola and C. dracaenae, and the shape of the ascospores differs from C. boninense, being slightly wider and less tapered in that species. Some strains have morphological features that are slightly different from those of strain CBS 127597 described above. Strain CBS 129833 forms rather larger asci (190–220 × 140–170 µm) and brown, roundish closed conidiomata that open by irregular rupture, covered with brown, verrucose to warted hairs/hyphae, 3–3.5 µm wide. In addition, the setae are more frequent, shorter (40–80 µm long), and broader at the base (5–7.5 µm diam). The appressoria are larger, measuring (5.5–) 7.5–13(–17) × (4.5–) 5.5–8.5(–10.5) µm, mean ± SD = 10.3 ± 2.6 × 7.1 ± 1.5 µm, L/W ratio = 1.4. This strain and CBS 111998 are also slower-growing than the type; on SNA: 20–22.5 mm in 7 d (32–34.5 mm in 10 d) and 20.5–22.5 mm in 7 d (30.5–31.5 mm in 10 d), and on OA: 21.5–23.5 mm in 7 d (33.5–35 mm in 10 d) and 15.5–16.5 mm in 7 d (25–27 mm in 10 d). There are some indications that CBS 129833 is distinct phylogenetically from the main body of C. karstii strains, but the sequence differences are slight. Colletotrichum novae-zelandiae Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560742. Etymology: Named after the country from which it was collected, New Zealand.

New Zealand has been isolated from ripe fruit of Capsicum and Citrus. Johnston & Jones (1997) identified this species as C. gloeosporioides group E, indicating that it was frequently isolated from Citrus fruits and also found on Passiflora edulis, although there was no molecular confirmation. The only close match in BLASTN searches (99% identity) was EU670082, the ITS sequence of the “Glomerella acutata” strain S43 from Prunus dulcis (almond) in Australia. That strain was isolated alongside C. acutatum and was shown to cause lesions on almond fruits in a pathogenicity test (McKay et al. 2009). It was first morphologically identified as C. acutatum by the authors and later recognized as C. boninense using molecular data. Teleomorphic structures were observed in mated cultures of some strains from Citrus spp. that probably belong to C. novae zelandiae, but their identity has not been confirmed by sequencing.
Ascomata develop on PDA after 14 days in tight clumps of 4–5, along margins between colonies, mostly lacking an obvious neck or possessing a short, broad, hyaline ostiolar neck. Asci were not observed. Ascospores are aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, fusiform to ovoid, usually straight but sometimes slightly curved, with measurements ranging from 12.5–19 × 5.5–7 µm (C1019.1 × C1041.19) to 16–22.5 × 4.5–7 µm (C1010.18 × C1015.3). No teleomorphic structures were observed in cultures derived from single conidia.
Colletotrichum oncidii Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560743. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Oncidium. The anamorph on SNA shows vegetative hyphae 1–7.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores and setae are formed directly from hyphae. Setae are medium brown, with the basal cell being paler and verruculose, 2–5-septate, measuring 65–120 µm long, sometimes branched, with a cylindrical base (3.5–5.5 µm in diameter) and an acute to rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, reaching up to 75 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, often extending to form new c
Material examined: Germany, Munich, greenhouse, from leaf of Oncidium sp., 20 Nov. 2010, U. Damm, (CBS H-20709 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 129828); Munich, greenhouse, from leaf of Oncidium sp., 20 Nov. 2010, U. Damm, CBS H-20708, culture CBS 130242. Notes: Colletotrichum oncidii forms a sister group to C. cymbidiicola, which are also orchid pathogens but recorded from the Asia-Pacific region rather than Europe. The known isolates of C. oncidii were from plants in greenhouses, and the ultimate origin of the species is uncertain. It has well-developed, strongly setose conidiomata in culture, pale conidia, and conidiogenous cells that extend to form new conidiogenous loci. Colletotrichum oncidii differs from the closely related C. boninense in forming appressoria that are larger and lobate, while those of C. boninense are entire or crenate. Colletotrichum oncidii also has longer setae (SNA: 65–120 µm, Anthriscus stem: 75–210 µm) that are 2–5-septate on both media, while those of C. boninense are only 20–60 or 30–70 µm long and 1–2-septate. No teleomorph is known.
Colletotrichum parsonsiae Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560744. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Parsonsia. Teleomorph on SNA. Ascomata perithecia, formed after 4 weeks, obpyriform, ostiolate, glabrous, measuring 100–170 × 120–220 µm. The peridium is composed of pale to medium brown, flattened textura angularis with cells measuring 5–16 µm in diameter. Interascal tissue is formed of paraphyses, which are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly cylindrical but tapering towards the rounded tip, disintegrating quickly, septate, and apically free, measuring 50–70 × 3–4 µm. Asci are unitunicate, 8-spored, cylindrical to clavate, tapering to apex and base, smooth-walled, measuring 70–80 × 10–13 µm. Ascospores are biseriately arranged, aseptate, hyaline, smooth-walled, broadly allantoid with rounded ends, measuring (12.5–)14–17(–18) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD = 15.7 ± 1.4 × 5.8 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7.
Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1–7 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–7 µm in diameter. Setae are pale to medium brown, with the basal cell often paler, smooth-walled, 2–4-septate, measuring 50–150 µm long, with a base that is cylindrical to conical (4–6 µm in diameter) and a tip that is ± acute to rounded. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 45 µm in leng
The Colletotrichum boninense species complex exhibits angular, thick-walled cells measuring 4–10.5 µm in diameter. The setae are dark brown, with the basal cell sometimes appearing paler, and are smooth-walled to verruculose, 2–4-septate, and 60–200 µm long. The base is cylindrical to conical, measuring 4.5–7.5 µm in diameter, with a rounded tip. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and up to 50 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, surrounded by a gelatinous sheath, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 4–16 × 3–4.5 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter, and collarettes ≤ 0.5 µm long with distinct periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with a rounded apex and base, visible hilum, and guttulate contents, measuring (15–)16.5–19(–20) × (4.5–)5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 17.6 ± 1.3 × 5.4 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 3.2.
Culture characteristics show that colonies on SNA are flat with entire margins, hyaline, and partly covered with salmon to grey conidiomata, while the Anthriscus stem is covered with white aerial mycelium. The reverse is hyaline to honey with salmon to grey flecks, measuring 20–24 mm in 7 days (32.5–34 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with entire margins, buff, fawn to rosy buff with dark grey to black conidiomata or ascomata, partly with floccose white aerial mycelium; the reverse is buff to fawn with olivaceous grey spots due to the conidiomata/ascomata shining through, measuring 22–26.5 mm in 7 days (35–37.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to orange.
Material examined includes a collection from New Zealand, Auckland, as a leaf endophyte from Parsonsia capsularis, collected on 1 Dec. 2009 by G. Carroll (CBS H-20710 holo
Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–8 µm in diameter, hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, roundish cells, measuring 4.5–9 µm in diameter. Setae are medium to dark brown, with the basal cell sometimes lighter, verruculose, 1–2(–3)-septate, 40–110 µm long; the base is somewhat bulbous, measuring 6–9 µm in diameter, and the tip is round to somewhat acute. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, and surrounded by a slimy gelatinous coating, reaching lengths of up to 50 µm. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, paler towards the tip, smooth, cylindrical to ampulliform, with a gelatinous coating, sometimes extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 11–16 × 3.5–5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter; collarette and periclinal thickening are inconspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, sometimes slightly constricted in the middle, with a round apex and a round base featuring a short prominent hilum, often guttulate and sometimes containing two large polar guttules, measuring (14.5–)15–17.5(–18.5) × (5.5–)6–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.3 ± 1.1 × 6.1 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7. Appressoria are irregular in shape, dark brown, sometimes nodose, not formed in chains, measuring (4.5–)8.5–15.5(–19) × (5–)6–10(–13) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.0 ± 3.4 × 7.9 ± 2.0 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5.
Anamorph on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores and setae formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells measuring 3–10 µm in diameter. Setae are medium to dark brown, with the base often paler, smooth to finely verruculose, 1–2(–3)-septate, 50–130 µm long, with the base being conical or inflated, measuring 5–10 µm wide, and the tip is round to somewhat acute. Conidiophores are pale brown, septate, branched, and up to 30 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are pale brown, smooth, cylindrical or conical, with annellations observed on some cells, measuring 9–16 × 4.5–6 µm, with openings of 1–2 µm in diameter; collarette is ≤ 0.5–1 µm long, and periclinal thickening is conspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical, sometimes slightly constricted in the middle, with a round apex and a round base featuring a short, prominent hilum; they can also be guttulate, measuring (12.3–)14.5–18(–21.1) × (5–)5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 16 ± 1.8 × 6 ± 0.3 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.7.

The Colletotrichum boninense species complex is also larger than those of C. karstii and C. phyllanthi. Conidia of C. hippeastri are larger, while C. dracaenophilum occurs on Dracaena spp. as well but is not closely related to C. petchii, as demonstrated by Farr et al. (2006). Their study included CBS 118193 and CBS 118774 (C. petchii). Another species from Dracaena, C. dracaenae fragrantis, has narrower conidia, measuring 5–12 × 2.5–3.5 µm (Saccardo 1895); its affinities are unclear. Colletotrichum dracaenicola (syn. C. dracaenae Trinchieri 1909, non Allesch.) may be a synonym of C. dracaenae. The conidial size was given as 12–19 × 2–7 µm by Saccardo & Trotter (1913), which is an unusually wide range but overlaps with that of C. dracaenae Allesch. Farr et al. (2006) could not locate the type specimen (it was not present in NAP, PORUN, or PAD), and the name therefore remains uncertain. Von Arx (1957) considered both C. dracaenae Allesch. and C. dracaenae Petch to be synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Farr et al. (2006) agreed with this conclusion concerning C. dracaenae Allesch. after studying type material, although their focus was on the need to demonstrate distinctions between C. dracaenae and their new species C. dracaenophilum. The shape of the conidia of C. dracaenae is similar to C. gloeosporioides, including the overall length and the constriction in the central part. The conidia were found to be noticeably wider in C. dracaenae compared with “typical” C. gloeosporioides. The original description (Allescher 1902) of the conidia of C. dracaenae Allesch. (14–18 × 5–7 µm, elongate-cylindri
Farr et al. (2006) noted that the fruit bodies had a very thin subhymenial layer that is only one or two layers thick. No other observations were made, and it is possible that the material they examined was effete. We re-examined the type and found conidiomata typical of the C. boninense aggregate. In concordance with Petch’s original description, the setae are strongly curved and tapering, and strongly verruculose towards the tip. Few conidia were seen, and those present were variable in shape and length/width ratio. The majority of those examined were 14–16 × 5–6.5 µm in size, cylindrical to doliiform with a rather prominent hilum. We place Petch’s illegitimate taxon with confidence in the C. boninense aggregate, and it is not unreasonable to suppose that it is synonymous with C. dracaenae Allesch. Petch (1925) contrasted his species with C. cordylines Pollacci but was evidently unaware of Allescher’s work. In contrast to other species in the C. boninense complex, C. dracaenae may be host-specific to Dracaena. The majority of Dracaena species are native to Africa, with a few in southern Asia and one in tropical Central America, and they are often grown as pot plants or in greenhouses. The host species of the isolates studied here are popular houseplants. Colletotrichum dracaenae was mostly isolated from leaves, where it caused leaf spots, as indicated in the sampling details of some of the isolates (Di Lenna & Montecchio 1995). Within the species, there is only low sequence variability, and separate clusters are obtained with all phylogenies employing single genes.
Colletotrichum phyllanthi (H. Surendranath Pai) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, comb. nov. MycoBank MB560746. Basionym: Glomerella phyllanthi H. Surendranath Pai, Mycopath. Mycol. appl. 42: 70. 1970. Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, lacking aerial mycelium; the reverse on filter paper is very pale luteous, measuring 21.3–23.8 mm in 7 days (32.5–33.8 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire to slightly undulate margin; the surface is buff to saffron, lacking aerial mycelium, and the reverse has the same colors, measuring 19–23 mm in 7 days (30.8–35 mm in 10 days). Anamorph and teleomorphic structures were not observed in the available culture.
Material examined: India, Maharashtra, Poona, from leaf anthracnose on Phyllanthus acidus, 10 Feb. 1966, H. Surendranath Pai, IMI 122826, holotype; Maharashtra, Poona, isolated from anthracnose symptoms on leaves of Phyllanthus acidus, 10 Feb. 1966, H. Surendranath Pai, CBS H-7188, isotype, dried culture (PDA) of ascigerous stage, culture ex-isotype CBS 175.67 = MACS 271. Notes: Glomerella phyllanthi is known only from the original collection taken from leaves of Phyllanthus acidus in India. The ex-type strain CBS 175.67, deposited in the CBS collection, did not sporulate under standard growth conditions. The description below is derived from the original publication (Pai 1970): “Perithecia isolated or gregarious, dark brown, 159–190.8 µm with long beaks measuring 47.7–150 µm. Ostiolar threads absent. Asci numerous, unitunicate, clavate, octosporous, arising in basal layers, sessile to subsessile, 43.2–56.6 × 8.6–10.8 µm. Paraphyses are abundant in early stages but disintegrate at maturity. Ascospores uniseriate or irregularly biseriate, elliptical to slightly curved, hyaline with oil globules at both ends, 12.9–17.28 × 2.1–6.4 µm.” Ascospore measurements from the isotype (CBS H-7188) agree with those of the original description: (14–)14.5–17(–18) × (4–)4.5–5.5(–6) µm, mean ± SD = 15.7 ± 1.1 × 5.1 ± 0.6 µm, L/W ratio = 3.1. Pai (1970) assumed that G. phyllanthi was the teleomorph of Colletotrichum heveae and did not provide a complete description of the anamorph, offering the following information: acervuli 113–159 µm, setae (only formed in old cultures) 63–143 µm, conidia cylindrical, oblong, 14–17 × 3–5 µm. No anamorph structures could be observed in the holotype
According to its original description, conidia of Glomerella phyllanthi are narrower than those of other species within the C. boninense complex, and none formed ascomata with a long beak as reported for G. phyllanthi, though it must be recognized that culture medium and growth conditions were not the same. According to the multigene phylogeny, G. phyllanthi forms a separate lineage close to C. karstii. This was also the case in 5 of 7 single-gene phylogenies. Glomerella phyllanthi causes anthracnose disease on the leaves of Phyllanthus acidus in India (Pai 1966) but has not been reported since. Farr & Rossman (2011) list C. gloeosporioides from Phyllanthus emblica in China (Zhuang 2001) and P. reticulatus in Myanmar (Thaung 2008), as well as an unidentified Colletotrichum sp. from P. acidus in India (Mathur 1979), of which at least the latter could be identical to G. phyllanthi. Pai (1970) regarded C. heveae Petch as the anamorph of G. phyllanthi based on the teleomorph strain being pathogenic to four of six Euphorbiaceae plant species tested, including Hevea brasiliensis, along with general morphological similarity. The conidium size of C. heveae was given as 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm by Petch (1906), which was incorrectly cited by Pai (1970) as 18–24 × 5–8 µm. Type material of Colletotrichum heveae (Sri Lanka, on Hevea, 7 Oct. 1905, Petch 2228, K(M) 167287) is in poor condition, with the Colletotrichum colonies overrun by saprobic species. The packet indicates that two species are present, Gloeosporium brunneum and C. heveae. Apart from the saprobic fungi, the only species now present is a Colletotrichum-like fungus that lacks setae but has rather variable, ± cylindrical conidia with rounded ends, mostly 14.5–16 × 4–6 µm in size. These are wider than typical C. gloeosporioides conidia and are reminiscent in some features of the C. boninense aggregate, so it is possible that the anamorph-teleomorph connection assumed by Pai (1970) is correct. However, there are no authentic cultures of C. heveae, and the type material is in a poor state. Gloeosporium brunneum Ellis & Everh. is considered to be the anamorph of Drepanopeziza punctiformis Gremmen (von Arx 1970), a north temperate pathogen of Populus, and is most unlikely to be present on a Hevea leaf from Sri Lanka. The use of that name by Petch remains a mystery. According to a note in the CBS database, von Arx did not support the teleomorph/anamorph connection assumed by Pai (1970), and we can see no clear reason why the two taxa should be linked in this way. Diseases of Hevea in south India caused by Colletotrichum species are attributable to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum aggregates (e.g., Saha et al. 2002; unpublished ITS sequences from this research deposited in GenBank confirm these identifications to species aggregate level). A species on Hevea from Colombia closely related to C. phyllanthi is described in this paper (see C. annellatum).
Colletotrichum torulosum Damm, P.F. Cannon, Crous, P.R. Johnst. & B. Weir, sp. nov. MycoBank MB560747. Etymology: Named in recognition of the highly convoluted nature of its appressoria. Anamorph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–7.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores and setae are formed directly from hyphae. Setae are medium brown, with the basal cell being paler, verruculose, 2–5-septate, and 65–120 µm long, sometimes branched, with a cylindrical base measuring 3.5–5.5 µm in diameter, and the tip is ± acute to ± rounded. Conidiop
The Colletotrichum torulosum species complex consists of conidia that are granular, measuring (13–)14–17(–21) × 5.5–6.5(–7.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.5 ± 1.5 × 6.0 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.6. The conidia from strain CBS 102667 are shorter, measuring (10.5–)12–14.5(–17.5) × (4.5–)5.5–6.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.4 ± 1.2 × 5.8 ± 0.5 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.3. The appressoria are medium to dark brown, with a variable outline and lobate margins, measuring (5.5–)8.5–14.5(–16.5) × (4.5–)6–9.5(–13) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.4 ± 2.9 × 7.7 ± 1.9 µm and an L/W ratio of 1.5. The anamorph occurs on Anthriscus stems, where the conidiomata are acervular, and conidiophores are formed on a cushion of pale brown, angular cells, measuring 3–10 µm in diameter. Setae were not observed in strain CBS 128544. However, in strain CBS 102667, the setae are medium brown, with the basal cell paler, verruculose, sometimes verrucose, and 0–2-septate, measuring 20–60 µm long, with a base that is cylindrical, conical, or slightly inflated, and a diameter of 4.5–6.5 µm, with a rounded tip. The conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 60 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are also hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical, often extending to form new conidiogenous loci, measuring 9–23 × 4.5–6.5 µm, with an opening of 1.5–2.5 µm in diameter, and a collarette measuring ≤ 0.5 µm in diameter, with conspicuous periclinal thickening. The conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical with rounded apex and base, possessing a prominent scar and containing guttulate contents, measuring (13.5–)14.5–16.5(–17.5) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 15.5 ± 0.9 × 5.8 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.7. Conidia from strain CBS 102667 are shorter, measuring 12–14.5(–18) × (5–)5.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.4 ± 1.3 × 5.7 ± 0.4 µm and an L/W ratio of 2.3.
Material examined includes samples from New Zealand: in Gisborne, Allen Park Gardens, from Solanum melongena (eggplant), collected on 6 Mar. 1990, by P.R. Johnston (CBS H-20715 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128544 = ICMP18586); and in Auckland, Mount Albert, from a leaf blotch of Passiflora edulis, collected in May 2000 by C.F. Hill, with CBS H-20716, culture CBS 102667.
Colletotrichum torulosum occupies a minor clade as a sister to a group containing C. boninense s. str. and an unnamed taxon found on orchids (CBS 123921). It has significantly longer conidia than C. boninense, with a larger L/W ratio. The conidia formed on SNA have hyaline, faintly verrucose vesicles attached to the base near the conidial scar; the function of these structures is unclear and may be artifacts. Similar vesicles also occur on conidia of C. cymbidiicola. Colletotrichum torulosum is known from two New Zealand collections, on Solanum and Passiflora. Endophytic strains from Dacrycarpus dacrydioides (Podocarpaceae) and Kunzea ericoides (Myrtaceae) leaves in New Zealand share the same ITS sequences as C. torulosum (EU482212, EU482213; Joshee et al. 2009), although their identity requires confirmation through comparison with sequences from other genes. Colletotrichum torulosum is not host-specific. It remains unclear whether it is a native New Zealand species that has jumped onto cultivated exotic plants or if it was imported through diseased plant material.
Moriwaki et al. (2003) differentiated C. boninense from C. gloeosporioides based on its wider conidia (L/W ratio = (1.8–)2–3(–3.3)), the prominent scar at the conidial base, and cream to orange-colored colonies on PDA. The L/W ratio of conidia of C. boninense s. str. and C. karstii (included in C. boninense by Moriwaki et al. 2003) are variable, ranging from 2.1 to 2.8 depending on isolate (and medium), while conidia of C. gloeosporioides have an L/W ratio of 2.6 to 3.0 (Cannon et al. 2008, Weir et al. 2012). According to Moriwaki et al. (2003), the shape of the appressoria in C. boninense differs from that seen in C. gloeosporioides, and setae are rarely produced in C. boninense. Many strains belonging to the C. boninense aggregate have more complex appressoria than those typical for C. gloeosporioides. None of the morphological characters of C. boninense enables unequivocal identification, and misplacement of strains based on morphology alone is common. For example, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides according to morphological characters but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study shows that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat., but to the C. boninense species complex, although the conidia are largely typical of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio. Conidiogenesis in the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes is usually percurrent, but more variable in C. boninense, depending on the site of septation in the conidiogenous cell that results in a prominent periclinal thickening. Sometimes distinct annellations are formed, which are common in C. annelatum and occasionally occur in C. dacrycarpi and C. petchii. After producing a number of conidia, the conidiogenous cells of many species extend without forming a septum and form a new conidiogenous locus at the tip. These processes can alternate, making the conidiogenous cell appear catenate, e.g., in C. constrictum, C. novae-zelandiae, and C. oncidii. Additionally, several species had an apparent gelatinous multi-layered coating around the conidiogenous cells. Differentiation between the two species complexes using morphological methods is problematic, but the diagnostic characters established by Moriwaki et al. (2003) can be used reliably to identify many isolates. A distinctive feature of the C. boninense complex in morphological terms is the conidiogenous cell with prominent periclinal thickening that extends to form a new conidiogenous locus. This feature is unknown in species of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012). Another distinctive feature of the C. boninense complex is the prominent scar (hilum) at the base of the conidia. Species of the C. boninense complex appear to be concentrated in certain regions of t
Four of the species in the C. boninense complex have only been found in New Zealand (two on indigenous plants), and three only from Colombia or Brazil (two of these from Passiflora). The species richness in New Zealand is surprising as no Colletotrichum taxon has previously been described from this country, apart from the formae speciales C. acutatum f. sp. pineum and C. gloeosporioides f. sp. camelliae. Compared with many countries, plant biosecurity is well supported in New Zealand, and both exotic and indigenous species are likely to be surveyed more intensively for pathogens than in many other regions of the world. Sampling bias is likely an explanation for this phenomenon. In some Colletotrichum species complexes, there is little or no evidence of host specificity even at the species level (e.g., Johnston & Jones 1997, Damm et al. 2009), while others appear to be associated with single host genera and/or families, as seen in the C. graminicola and C. orbiculare species complexes (Crouch et al. 2009, Liu et al. 2007). There are indications that a few of the segregate taxa within the C. boninense complex are host-specific, or at least show a preference for hosts from particular plant groups. Morikawi et al. (2003) detected four molecular subgroups within the species as they defined it, using ITS1 data. The primary branch separated strains from monocotyledonous (monocot) and dicotyledonous (dicot) plant hosts. The dicot clade did not show any clear host-linked substructure, but the monocot clade contained three subclades, with one restricted to Orchidaceae and the other two containing strains from Crinum (Amaryllidaceae). The dicot clade corresponds to C. karstii as recognized in this paper, while the monocot clade contains C. boninense s. str. Our research does not support this split. While occurring on a wide range of dicots, C. karstii was also described on Orchidaceae and occurs on other monocots as well, especially Musa spp. Of the other segregate species that we recognize, C. dracaenae and C. hippeastri seem to be specific at the host genus level, although the number of strains that we have examined is insufficient to confirm these indications. A feature of many strains of the C. boninense aggregate is the production of a teleomorph. The Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum have been inadequately studied in comparison to the anamorphs. Von Arx & Müller (1954) carried out a global revision using morphological characters, and Uecker (1994) completed an ontogenetic study of one C. gloeosporioides isolate. We know that at least some strains of most of the principal species aggregates can undergo meiosis, including the C. acutatum group (Guerber & Correll 2001, Guerber et al. 2003, Marcelino et al. 2008), the C. destructivum group (Armstrong-Cho & Banniza 2006, linked to an anamorph misidentified as C. truncatum), the C. orbiculare group (Rodriguez-Guerra et al. 2005), and the C. graminicola group (Crouch et al. 2009). The Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum species are morphologically uniform, with ascospore size and shape being the only feature that has been credited with any diagnostic value. There is much overlap in published dimensions, and it is not practical to distinguish the sexual structures of the C. boninense aggregate from those of the other groups using morphological methods alone. Lu et al. (2004) observed high genetic variability among Colletotrichum strains, including some from the C. boninense complex, from trees in the Iwokrama Forest Reserve in Guyana by means of ISSR-PCR, RAPD PCR, and ITS rDNA sequencing. Almost no two strains were genetically identical, and this variability was postulated to be due to meiosis. Comparing about 80 isolates from different tree species in the same area, they also did not detect host specificity, neither at the species nor population level.
Those cultures were not available to us, but some of their ITS sequences diverge from those of the main body of the C. boninense species complex and may represent further segregate taxa. The relationship between endophytic and pathogenic isolates of Colletotrichum needs more research, as some endophytes may be latent pathogens, while others appear exclusively endophytic. In both studies, endophytes did not appear to be strongly host-specific. Most of the species in our study of the C. boninense species complex are known only from a few isolates, either from a single host genus or from more than one host genus, often with a limited distribution. However, two species were represented by many isolates: C. karstii and C. boninense, with C. karstii having the widest host range and distribution. Almost all strains isolated as endophytes belong to C. karstii, although this species also includes strains derived from diseased plant tissues. More research is needed into the life strategies and host-parasite relationships of the fungi belonging to this clade. Detailed studies of the C. boninense complex have demonstrated that even recently recognized species of Colletotrichum may mask extensive variation at the molecular level, containing multiple taxa with distinct evolutionary origins. The debate regarding whether these segregate taxa should be recognized at the species or infraspecific level has not been resolved, but recent trends lean towards considering them as independent species. This approach simplifies references to them; however, in many cases, the name does not indicate host specificity or nutritional/biological strategy, limiting its practical value for applied mycologists and plant pathologists. Unfortunately, many of these species cannot be reliably identified at this time using single diagnostic (barcoding) sequences, and this aspect of their systematics must be prioritized in future research. On a positive note, we now have substantially more information about the C. boninense complex in terms of its phylogenetic constituents.
