We studied, through field experiments, the combined effects of irrigation system, mulching material, and genetic resistance on the incidence of strawberry anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum acutatum. All trials involved artificial inoculation with fruits colonized by the pathogen. One experiment examined the effects of drip irrigation, overhead sprinkler irrigation, and localized low-pressure tape irrigation, as well as the effects of grass (Brachiaria sp.) and plastic (polyethylene) mulches, in a split plot, randomized complete block design with four replicates. Lower disease incidence, indicating lower pathogen dispersal, was verified with low-pressure tape and drip irrigation. Flower blight and fruit rot incidence in drip-irrigated plots was minimal (approximately 2% of the disease levels in the plots otherwise irrigated). Grass mulch reduced flower blight in the sprinkler system (up to 80%), but had no significant effect when disease levels were already low due to the use of other irrigation systems. A second experiment compared the effects of grass mulch, pine (Pinus elliottii) mulch, and plastic mulch with overhead sprinkler irrigation on strawberry cultivars partially resistant (‘Dover’) and susceptible (‘Campinas’) to the disease in a factorial completely randomized design (CRD). Both organic mulches reduced flower blight and diseased fruit incidence by up to 76% compared to the plastic mulch treatment, especially in the early stages of the epidemics. ‘Dover’ had a 70% lower incidence of flower blight than ‘Campinas,’ and the effects of organic mulches were more pronounced in ‘Campinas.’ A third experiment, with all three irrigation systems combined with inoculated and non-inoculated plots, estimated yield effects due to disease and irrigation system. All plots were covered with plastic mulch in a CRD with six treatments. This experiment clearly confirmed the higher flower blight and fruit rot incidences when sprinkler irrigation was used. In inoculated treatments, fruit yield was significantly reduced in tape-irrigated plots, and more so in sprinkler-irrigated plots. In drip-irrigated plots, yield was reduced by only 1%. Overall, our results confirm the importance of cultural and genetic factors as valuable means of strawberry anthracnose management. Adoption of localized irrigation systems, the use of organic mulches, and the choice of a partially resistant cultivar significantly reduced disease levels in field plots. The importance of water splash for C. acutatum dispersal and its dependency on the soil mulch characteristics are the likely causes for the observed results.

Simmonds (Gunnel and Gluber 1992) describes symptoms that occur on fruit, buds, blossoms, petioles, runners, crowns, and foliage. The two most destructive forms of the disease are crown rot anthracnose, usually caused by C. fragariae and primarily affecting roots, crowns, and fruit; and the flower blight and fruit rot caused by C. acutatum (Howard et al. 1992; Maas 1998). Fruit rot and flower blight caused by C. acutatum are arguably the main limiting factors for strawberry production in Brazil. This disease leads to significant yield losses and contributes to a large portion of the fungicide schedule still used by Brazilian growers (Henz et al. 1992; Furlanetto et al. 1996). However, fungicide applications do not always provide effective control, and resistance to some active ingredients has been reported (e.g., Kososki et al. 2001; Pedroso and Café-Filho 2005). Furthermore, the majority of cultivars, such as Oso Grande, Sweet Charlie, and Campinas, are highly susceptible to anthracnose. Although the cultivar Dover is relatively resistant to the disease, it can still suffer high losses under conducive environmental and management conditions (Furlanetto et al. 1996).
Conidia of Colletotrichum are produced in masses immersed in a water-soluble mucilage in reproductive structures called acervulae, which serve to prevent desiccation (Nicholson and Moraes 1980). The germination of conidia is inhibited by this mucilage, and its dissolution is necessary for germination (Louis et al. 1988; Leite and Nicholson 1992). Thus, conidial release, dispersal, and the occurrence of disease epidemics are heavily dependent on free water and water splash. Dispersal of C. acutatum is favored by extended rains (Yang et al. 1990a; Madden et al. 1996), while short periods of precipitation are efficient for short-distance dispersal among plants (Yang et al. 1990b; Madden et al. 1992, 1996). In Brazil, strawberries are typically cultivated during the dry winter season, requiring irrigation. The traditional overhead sprinkler irrigation system is the most popular among growers; however, localized systems such as drip irrigation and low-pressure tape irrigation are increasingly being adopted. Localized irrigation can be achieved through drip irrigation under plastic mulch or surface low-pressure streams from plastic tapes, characterized by high application efficiency. Although drip irrigation is recommended for improving fruit quality, it is more expensive and requires more maintenance than surface plastic tapes.
Strawberry fields are traditionally mulched, a widespread practice in Brazil that enhances fruit quality and reduces costs associated with weed control. However, plastic mulching has been shown to favor the splash-dispersal of Colletotrichum conidia (Yang et al. 1990a, 1990b, 1992; Madden et al. 1993). The effects of irrigation practices, soil cover, and genetically based resistance on strawberry anthracnose have not been studied in detail in Brazil, where economic losses due to this disease have been significant. Additionally, complete host resistance is not commercially available, resistance to fungicides is known, and consumer and environmental concerns about fungicide use are increasing. Therefore, this study aims to examine the effects of irrigation systems, mulching materials, and genetically based resistance, as well as their interactions, on the incidence of strawberry anthracnose
2. Materials and methods
2.1. Origin, preparation of inoculum and inoculation
All experiments were inoculated with a mix of C. acutatum isolates UnB-1917 and UnB-1922, both collected in commercial fields in Brazlândia, DF, Brazil, and previously identified as virulent by Barros et al. (1997). Prior to field inoculation, isolates were inoculated onto strawberry fruits and re-isolated to ensure virulence. Plots were inoculated with artificially infected strawberry fruits prepared in accordance with Yang et al. (1990a, 1990b). For the first experiment, plots were infested with 35 diseased strawberry fruits placed on 30-cm diameter aluminum trays 0.10 m above soil level in the space between beds 70 days after transplanting (DAT). For the second experiment, diseased fruits were placed on open Petri dishes with five to seven fruits per dish and five dishes per plot distributed in the center row of each treatment at 68 DAT. For the third experiment, one focus was created in each plot by placing five diseased fruits around the most central plant of each treatment at 65 DAT. Throughout the study, the identity of C. acutatum as the causal agent for the observed symptoms was confirmed by periodic pathogen isolation from symptomatic flowers and flower buds.
2.2. Effect of irrigation systems and mulching material on the progress of strawberry anthracnose
Effects of irrigation systems and mulching materials were first studied on cv. Campinas IAC-2712, which is susceptible to anthracnose. Three systems of irrigation were compared: (a) overhead sprinkler irrigation; (b) localized low-pressure tape irrigation; and (c) drip irrigation. Sprinkler irrigation was conducted at an average outflow of 0.12 l/s, with sprinklers (West-Wal) placed at 0.80 m above soil surface. The localized low-pressure tape irrigation system was performed with low-density, laser-perforated plastic tapes (Santape), with perforations 0.15 m apart and an outflow of 12 l/h per m. For the drip-irrigated plots, two plastic drip irrigation lines were placed between the plant rows, and emitters (Typhoon 125) were placed 0.30 m apart, with an outflow of 1.65 l/h per emitter. Irrigation events were conducted every 2 or 3 days, with the depth of water calculated according to Klar (1991) and corrected for the efficiency of each system (Pair et al. 1983). Soil moisture was monitored periodically with tensiometers. To minimize the effects of wind on the distribution of water, irrigation was always carried out in the morning, except on the day of inoculation, when irrigations were applied immediately after inoculation at sunset. Two mulching materials were compared: (a) 0.03 mm black, non-permeable polyethylene plastic, equivalent to the mulch adopted by most strawberry growers in Brazil, and (b) sun-dried grass mulch (Brachiaria sp.), collected in areas adjacent to the experiment, to a depth of approximately 4 cm. Mulches were placed onto plots 25 DAT.
The incidence (%) of flower blight was recorded in all plants at growing radial distances from the foci. The percentage of flowers showing symptoms of flower blight was estimated by weekly counts of the number of symptomatic flower buds and the total number of flower buds at 20, 27, 34, 41, 47, and 55 days after inoculation (DAI). Values of the areas under disease progress curves (AUDPC) for each plot were calculated according to Shaner and Finney (1977). The percentage of diseased fruits was calculated similarly by recording the number of mature healthy and damaged fruits. Fruits were harvested weekly, starting 72 days after transplant (DAT), when more than two-thirds of the fruit surface was red. The inci
The experiment followed a 3 × 6 × 2 factorial in a split-plot design with four replicates. The irrigation system was the whole-plot factor, and the mulching material was the sub-plot factor. Beds measured 1.10 × 0.20 m, with three rows of plants spaced 0.35 m apart. Experimental units consisted of two parallel beds with three lines of seven plants each, totaling 42 plants. The experimental plots were separated longitudinally by 0.60 m of bare soil to reduce interplot interference. Incidence data were normalized prior to statistical analysis and mean separation. AUDPC values were also subjected to ANOVA and subsequent mean separation using Tukey’s multiple range test.
Effect of Mulching Material and Partial Resistance
The single and combined effects of mulching materials and partial host resistance on the incidence of flower blight were studied under conditions of overhead sprinkler irrigation. Three mulching materials were compared: (a) 0.03-mm black, non-permeable polyethylene plastic, (b) sun-dried grass mulch (Brachiaria sp.), and (c) sun-dried pine mulch (Pinus elliottii) collected from a reforestation area to a depth of approximately 4 cm. Mulches were applied to plots 25 days after transplanting (DAT). Two cultivars with different levels of resistance to anthracnose were compared: (a) cv. Campinas IAC 2712 (susceptible) and (b) cv. Dover (partially resistant). Although ‘Dover’ is reported as resistant to C. acutatum, resistance is not complete, and high losses due to anthracnose have been noted in Brasília for this genotype. The incidence of flower blight and diseased fruits (%) was recorded weekly at 23, 29, 37, and 44 days after inoculation (DAI). AUDPCs were calculated as previously described. The experiment was a 2 × 3 factorial in a split-plot design with three replicates. The whole-plot factor was cultivar, and the sub-plot factor was mulching material. Experimental units consisted of one bed with 18 plants distributed in three lines of six plants. The experimental plots were separated longitudinally by 0.60 m of bare soil. Disease data were analyzed by ANOVA and subsequent mean separation using Tukey’s multiple range test.
Effect of Irrigation System on Anthracnose Incidence and Strawberry Fruit Yield
A third experiment was conducted to estimate the effects of the disease and irrigation systems on fruit yield. The effects of overhead sprinkler irrigation, localized low-pressure tape irrigation, and drip irrigation were compared on inoculated and non-inoculated plots of cv. Campinas. All plots were covered with plastic mulch as described previously. The experiment was a 2 × 3 factorial in a completely randomized design with six treatments and six replicates. Experimental units consisted of one bed with 21 plants, distributed in three lines of seven plants. Inoculated and non-inoculated beds were spaced 1.0 m apart, and a perpendicular plastic barrier was placed between beds to minimize interplot interference. The following variables were recorded: (a) incidence of flower blight, (b) incidence of diseased fruits, and (c) total fruit yield. Disease data were compared using ANOVA and subsequent mean separation with Tukey’s multiple range test.
Results
Effect of Irrigation Systems and Mulching Material on the Progress of Strawberry Anthracnose
First flower blight symptoms due to C. acutatum were observed in the treatments with overhead and localized low-pressure overhead tape irrigation 20 days after inoculation (DAI). Disease occurrence in the drip-irrigated treatment was only observed very late in the season at 47 DAI, albeit at low incidence (0.2%). In the early stages of the epidemics (20 DAI), the interaction between irrigation systems and mulching materials was significant (P < 0.05), indicating that the effects of the mulches were influenced by the irrigation system applied. The highest incidence of flower blight was found in the combination of overhead irrigation and plastic mulch material. Later in the epidemics (27–47 DAI, not shown), significant interactions between irrigation and mulching materials ceased to be observed (P > 0.05). The lack of significant interactions between main factors allowed for separate contrasts of irrigation system and mulch type. Disease levels were lower in low-pressure tape-irrigated plots than in those irrigated by overhead sprinklers, regardless of the mulch material applied. Similarly, disease levels in plots covered with grass mulch were lower than those using plastic mulch. At the last stages of the epidemics (55 DAI), the interaction between irrigation systems and mulching material was significant (P < 0.01): for overhead-irrigated plots, the use of plastic mulch increased the incidence of flower blight more than three-fold, while no significant effect of mulching material was observed for the drip-irrigated or plastic tape-irrigated plots. No significant interactions between irrigation and mulching materials were found for the Area Under the Disease Progress Curve (AUDPC) of the incidence of blighted flowers. The average AUDPC values for drip, plastic tapes, and overhead irrigation were significantly different (P < 0.01). AUDPCs between plastic and grass mulch were similar (P > 0.05). First fruit symptoms were observed 35 DAI. Diseased fruits often had orange-colored masses of spores over lesions. Analogous to the incidence of blighted flowers, the percentage of diseased fruits was significantly (P < 0.05) higher in the overhead irrigated plots (21%), followed by plastic tapes (17%) and drip irrigation (6% diseased fruit). The incidence of diseased fruit was similar between grass and plastic mulched plots, ranging between 14.2% and 15.1%. While no disease gradient was observed in the plastic mulched plots, in the grass mulched plots, more diseased fruit was found closer to the inoculum source, decreasing gradually with increasing distances from the inoculum.
The first symptoms of flower blight in this experiment were observed 23 DAI, when a significantly lower percentage of blighted flowers was found in the plots treated with grass mulch (P < 0.05), while no effects of genetic resistance or of the interaction between mulching material and cultivar were detected at this point in the epidemics. At 29 DAI, the incidence of blighted flowers in the plots treated with plastic mulch was greater than in the plots treated with either grass or pine mulch (P < 0.05). The effect of genetic resistance was also significant at 29 DAI (P < 0.05). Disease incidence on cultivar Campinas reached 23.3% of flowers, while ‘Dover’ reached only 7.5% blighted flowers. No interaction between mulching material and cultivar was observed at the early stages of the epidemics (23 and 29 DAI).

DAI). No symptoms were observed in the non-inoculated control plots. Throughout the entire extent of the epidemics, the highest percentage of infected flowers was found in the overhead-irrigated plots, followed by the plots irrigated with low-pressure tapes. The incidence of blighted flowers in overhead-irrigated plots was consistently 2–5 times greater than in tape-irrigated plots. No disease was recorded in drip-irrigated plots. The first fruit symptoms in this experiment were observed early in the overhead-irrigated plots (7 DAI). In contrast, the first fruit symptoms in the drip-irrigated plots were observed only at 27 DAI. The percentage of infected mature strawberry fruits was low in drip-irrigated plots (less than 1%), intermediate in low-pressure tape-irrigated plots (3.1%), and 10 times greater in the overhead-irrigated plots (10.3%). The percentage of damaged fruits in the negative controls was lower than 1%, regardless of the irrigation system. Fruit yield was not significantly different between inoculated and non-inoculated treatments with the drip irrigation system.
The incidence of flower blight caused by Colletotrichum acutatum in field conditions similar to strawberry growers' practices was strongly affected by irrigation system, type of mulch, and host genetic resistance. Flower blight and fruit rot were minimized with irrigation systems and mulching types associated with reduced water splash. Organic material, especially dried grass mulch, significantly reduced disease levels under overhead irrigation. Organic mulches did not affect disease levels significantly under localized drip or low-pressure irrigation, presumably because water splash is already reduced by these practices. The incomplete level of disease resistance presented by cv. Dover, although insufficient for total disease suppression, proved useful when combined with a suitable irrigation system and type of mulch.
The data regarding the effect of genetic resistance and mulching material on disease progression showed the area under disease progress curves for two cultivars of strawberries, cv. Dover and cv. Campinas, with cv. Dover demonstrating significantly lower disease progression. Additionally, the influence of different mulching materials—grass, pine, and plastic—was assessed, revealing varying impacts on disease development.
The study further detailed the percentages of blighted flowers, rotted fruit, and total fruit yield in strawberry plots that were either inoculated or non-inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum, across three irrigation systems: overhead, low-pressure, and drip. The results indicated that overhead irrigation led to a higher percentage of blighted flowers and rotted fruit, while drip irrigation showed minimal disease incidence. This suggests that the choice of irrigation system plays a critical role in managing disease in strawberry cultivation.
The disease progress curves display the separate treatment effects of each of the cultural choices (irrigation, mulch, and cultivar) for strawberry flower blight. The environmental effects of irrigation choice and mulch type, along with the slow-blighting effect of cultivar resistance on the disease cycle, were compounded several times due to the multiple cycles of this polycyclic disease, resulting in slower overall disease progress and reduced final disease levels. The overall effects of the irrigation system and mulching material during the planting season were represented by the AUDPC values. This variable, which integrates the cumulative effect of each treatment combination, indicated that the irrigation system was the main driving factor in the epidemics, while the choice of grass mulch was a secondary driving factor. However, since growers sometimes favor overhead irrigation for mite and powdery mildew control, the importance of mulch type increases. Several authors have noted a significant reduction in the incidence of flower blight in treatments with grass mulch compared to plastic mulch, regardless of natural or simulated precipitation. These effects occur with common irrigation practices in Brazil, likely due to reduced dispersal of C. acutatum conidia, which is highly dependent on water splash. While no spatial pattern analyses were performed, the observed decrease in disease levels with increasing distances from the inoculum source in grass-mulched plots suggests reduced pathogen dispersal in these plots. In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose showed that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field, with synergistic effects when these practices are adopted concurrently. In contrast, the choice of a more susceptible cultivar, overhead sprinkler irrigation, and plastic mulch favored high levels of flower blight. While our results must be interpreted with caution, given the lack of perfectly replicated trials, the effect of each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in more than one experiment, which partially validates these conclusions. Furthermore, the adoption of these cultural practices did not result in yield loss in the absence of the disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of ‘Dover’ than in plots of ‘Campinas’ due to the fact that more flowers of ‘Dover’ survived earlier in the season, resulting in more healthy tissue available for infection later on. Finally, we stress that strawberry production in Brazil remains heavily dependent on fungicide applications, which are not completely efficient for anthracnose control and raise consumer concerns about food safety. Our study shows that management of flower blight can be quite efficient with a combination of cultural choices, likely reducing dependency on chemical control.
