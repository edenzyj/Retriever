Strawberry Parent Clones US 70, US 159, US 292, and US 438 Resistant to Anthracnose Crown Rot
The clones described in this germplasm release were developed through a collaborative effort by the U.S. Department of Agriculture (USDA) and state agricultural experiment station personnel to address the limitations posed by anthracnose crown rot disease on strawberry (Fragaria ×ananassa Duch.) production in the southeastern United States. The initiative to create anthracnose-resistant strawberry germplasm began in 1975, with contributions of strawberry selections and fungal isolates from the USDA, the University of Florida, Louisiana State University, and North Carolina State University. Breeding efforts to produce regionally resistant host materials commenced in Beltsville, Maryland, in 1976 under the direction of A.D. Draper and have continued since 1977 under G.J.G. From 1975, disease epidemiology information and inoculation techniques were developed in Poplarville, Mississippi, directed by B.J.S. Initially, anthracnose crown rot was believed to be caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks; however, C. acutatum Simmonds has also been responsible for severe strawberry fruit rot. Additionally, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. may cause strawberry anthracnose crown and fruit rot. While all three fungal species can lead to strawberry plant death, C. fragariae is the primary cause of disease in the U.S. Gulf Coast states, with C. acutatum being the leading cause of anthracnose fruit rot in the region. Resistance inheritance models for anthracnose crown rot were established by Gupton and Smith. The clones we describe not only exhibit a high degree of resistance to anthracnose crown rot but also possess near-commercial fruit quality and productivity, making them valuable candidates for breeding programs aimed at incorporating anthracnose resistance into strawberries suitable for other regions.
Data for plants grown in Poplarville were collected and analyzed by B.J.S., while morphological plant and fruit characterizations were conducted in 1991 at Poplarville using a scalar interval scoring system developed by G.J.G. The data from Beltsville were gathered by G.J.G.
Origins and Descriptions
US 70, initially tested as MSUS 70, resulted from a cross made in 1979 at Beltsville between Florida selection 76-802 and Louisiana selection 2556. Seedlings from this cross were inoculated in 1980 at Poplarville with C. fragariae isolates. Resistant seedlings were cultivated in Poplarville, leading to the selection of US 70 in 1981. This clone has been used by researchers to differentiate betwee
US 70 was produced alongside the standard cultivar Tangi in 1990 and 1991, as well as ‘Chandler’ in 1990, and performed better than ‘Chandler’ during the abbreviated 1991 season. US 70 fruit were produced later and were the same size as ‘Tangi’ fruit in 1990, but ripened earlier and were larger than those from ‘Tangi’ in 1991. In 1990, US 70 fruit ripened later and were smaller than ‘Chandler’ fruit, but in 1991, they ripened earlier and were larger than ‘Chandler’. The outstanding features of US 70 include high resistance levels to leaf spot (Mycosphaerella fragariae), leaf scorch (Diplocarpon earliana), powdery mildew (Sphaerotheca macularis), anthracnose crown rot, and two-spotted mites (Tetranychus urticae); good fruit quality; desirable bright red and large fruit; and an extended harvest season. US 70 plants are medium-sized and compact, with medium-green leaves featuring three leaflets of equal size. Central leaflets curve down at the tips, while side leaflets curve up at the margins. The leaf serrations are rounded but pointed at the tip. The veins on the leaf underside are prominent, and the leaf petioles are light green and pubescent. The fruit of US 70 have a shouldered wedge shape with a blunt tip; narrow, pointed fruit cap sepals that are partially reflexed at maturity; and slightly raised yellow achenes. The fruit is firm-fleshed, light pink internally, and juicy, with a pleasant flavor characterized as sweet and acidic. US 70 transmitted anthracnose resistance to 80% of its progenies and is likely to be a suitable disease-resistant parent for either winter or early spring hill culture production, or mid- to late spring matted row production. US 70 has been successfully grown in Poplarville, Beltsville, and Bonita Springs, Florida.
US 159, tested as MSUS 159, resulted from a 1982 cross in Beltsville between two anthracnose-resistant selections, LA 7525-A and US 78-1760 AN (Florida Belle × LA 2556). In 1983 in Poplarville, it was screened against a mixture of C. fragariae isolates, including CF-1, CF-4, FL-2, LA-1, CF-75, and CF-CARD. US 159 has also been tested in Poplarville, Beltsville, and Bonita Springs. It transmitted anthracnose resistance to 55% of its progenies and is notable for its fruit yield, size, color, leaf and fruit disease tolerance, vigor, good balance of fruit characteristics, and long ripening season. However, US 159 may experience some pollination problems in cool weather and some fruit cracking in wet weather. The plants are large, medium de
US 292 showed high resistance to anthracnose, crown rot, two-spotted mites, leaf spot, and leaf scorch. It generally had good plant health and the ability to generate runners. During the more normal 1990 season in Mississippi, US 292 yielded as well as ‘Chandler’ but less than ‘Tangi’; its fruit ripened later, and its plants were more vigorous than either standard cultivar. US 292 fruit was larger than ‘Tangi’ fruit and the same size as ‘Chandler’ in 1990, but larger than either standard in 1991. In Maryland, US 292 was a promising late-maturing clone in matted row production. It showed a fine balance of fruit and plant traits, producing an outstanding plant bed and fruit with superior size, symmetry, firmness, skin color and gloss, flesh color, and flavor. US 292 plants are medium-sized with an open habit and are disease-free in the field. Its leaves are deep green on top, light green underneath, and slightly down-curved with prominent veins and hairy petioles. US 292 fruit has firm skin and flesh, is flavorful, aromatic, and slightly acidic. The fruit is short conic and medium-large in appearance, with slightly raised achenes. Its caps are large and showy; individual parts are lanceolate to ovate and acuminate, and partially reflexed at maturity.
US 438, tested as MSUS 438, resulted from a cross between resistant clones MSUS 56 and MSUS 70 in an anthracnose inheritance study at Poplarville. US 438 survived a natural greenhouse epiphytotic of C. fragariae in 1986 and has shown resistance to field infestations by the fungus since 1987. It was selected at Poplarville in 1988. Recent tests by North Carolina cooperators indicate that US 438 is also resistant to runner infection incited by C. acutatum. In Mississippi, US 438 has yielded as well as ‘Tangi’ and better than ‘Chandler’. It is earlier than either standard and had both smaller and larger fruit than the standard cultivars during two seasons. In matted row production in Maryland, US 438 was an average performer, ripening early with generally good plant bed and fruit characteristics. Fruit symmetry and skin toughness were subpar, but plant stand, vigor, and fruit firmness were superior. US 438 plants are large, dense, vigorous, and free of disease. Leaves are large and rugose, with leaflets turning down at the tip as they age. Leaves are medium to light green with light green undersides, featuring prominent main and branch veins. The leaves have sharply pointed serrations and pubescent petioles, with hairs at a 90° angle to the stem axis. Flower petals are rounded and overlapping, anthers are small with abundant pollen, stamens are erect, and sepals are narrow. US 438 fruit is dark scarlet and firm, has a dry consistency, and is acidic with a good flavor. Fruit shape is a long wedge with achenes flush to slightly raised; the cap is large, showy, and partially reflexed. Foll
