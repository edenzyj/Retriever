Twenty strains representing eight species of Colletotrichum were isolated from lesions of various species of amaryllids (monocotyledons, Amaryllidaceae) in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou Provinces in China and Chiang Rai Province, Thailand. They are characterized through morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses based on actin, β-tubulin (tub2), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase A (CHS I), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), and the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequence data. Colletotrichum cliviae, C. hippeastri, and C. hymenocallidis are new species described and illustrated in this paper based on morphological characters and multi-gene sequence data. Pathogenicity testing indicated that the three new taxa from Amaryllidaceae are not host-specific.

Introduction
Colletotrichum is among the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, and species cause disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Some of the better-known species include Colletotrichum linde muthianum (Sacc. & Magnus) Briosi & Cavara, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc., C. acutatum J
Japan (Moriwaki et al., 2003). Although ITS sequence data may assist in identifying Colletotrichum species, it cannot alone adequately address species delimitation for closely related species (Crouch et al., 2009a). Researchers have recently examined multiple gene sequence data to distinguish species within Colletotrichum (Du et al., 2005; Johnston et al., 1997; Crouch et al., 2006, 2009b,c; Farr et al., 2006; Shenoy et al., 2007a,b; Than et al., 2008a,b; Moriwaki and Tsukiboshi, 2009). Using multilocus phylogenetics, Crouch et al. (2006; 2009b) separated C. cereale and C. eleusines from C. graminicola and introduced six new Colletotrichum species from warm-season grass hosts. Multigene sequence analyses are beneficial for clarifying confusion in Colletotrichum systematics.
Amaryllids (members of the Amaryllidaceae) are bulbous herbs characterized by distichous or rarely rosulate leaves and a lateral, solid, naked scape, which is terminated by an umbel-like cluster of showy flowers (Meerow et al., 1998). Several amaryllids have economic value in medicine, while species and/or hybrids of Nerine, Amaryllis, and Crinum are cultivated in many countries for their elegant flowers (Dahlgren et al., 1985). Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose on Amaryllidaceae have been reported from Japan (Horie et al., 1990; Moriwaki et al., 2003) and China (Liu et al., 2000). The disease symptoms include depressed reddish-brown lesions on leaves or scapes, limiting the commercial production of ornamental and medicinal plants (Liu et al., 2000). Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib., C. crassipes (Speg.) Arx, C. dematium (Pers.) Grove, and C. capsici (Syd.) E.J. Butler & Bisby have been reported to infect Amaryllis sp., Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum, and Clivia miniata (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003). In this study, we utilize combined morphological and molecular characteristics to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in China and Thailand.
Materials and Methods Isolation of Colletotrichum Colletotrichum samples were collected from anthracnose lesions on Clivia, Crinum, Hippeastrum, and Hymenocallis (Amaryllidaceae) in Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces, China, and Chiang Rai Province, Thailand, from June 2008 to September 2009. Isolation was carried out through two methods depending on the status of fungal sporulation. Isolates were obtained from lesions without visible sporulation using the procedure described by Photita et al. (2005). Single-spore isolations from infected leaves or scapes with sporulation were also carried out using the procedure d
Starter cultures were prepared by plating each isolate onto PDA at 25°C. Five 4 mm plugs were aseptically cut from actively sporulating areas near the growing edge of a 5-day-old culture of each isolate using a sterile cork borer. Each plug was placed onto PDA plates (Petri dishes with a diameter of 90 × 15 mm) and grown in alternating 12 hours of near UV light and 12 hours of darkness at 25ºC. Colony diameter was measured on day six (for the fastest-growing cultures, on day four). The growth rate was calculated as the 6-day or 4-day average of mean daily growth (mm per day). After 7-10 days, the size and shape of 50 conidia harvested from the culture were assessed. The color of the conidial masses and zonation were recorded on day seven. Mycelial appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, where 10 mm squares of potato carrot agar (PCA) were placed in an empty Petri dish. The edge of the PCA was inoculated with small sections of mycelia, and a cover slip was placed over the inoculated agar. After 5-14 days, appressoria formed across the underside of the cover slip, and their shape and size were then recorded. Conidial appressoria of some strains with cylindrical spores were also recorded. Conidial appressoria were induced by inoculating with conidia in two drops of distilled water on a microscope slide, placing it inside Petri dishes containing moistened cotton with distilled sterile water, and incubating at 25ºC in darkness. After 24 hours of incubation, conidial appressoria formed from germ tubes and were subsequently measured.
DNA was extracted from all isolates growing on PDA at room temperature for 8-10 days using a modified protocol. The gene regions were amplified using specific primers. The PCR amplifications were performed in a 25 µl mixture containing 9.5 µl ddH2O, 12.5 µl 2× PCR Master Mix, 1 µl of DNA templates, and 1 µl of each primer. The reactions were conducted using a thermal cycler with a defined thermal program: 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C for 30 seconds), annealing (at specific temperatures for different genes), elongation (72°C for 90 seconds), and a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. PCR products were examined by electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and purified using a purification kit. Purified samples were sequenced using the PCR primers on a DNA analyzer. Two gene amplicons were cloned into a vector and then sequenced.
Phylogenetic analysis was performed using six gene regions. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using specific software, treating gaps as missing data. Each of the single and combined sequence alignments was analyzed using maximum parsimony methods. Ambiguously aligned regions were excluded from all analyses. Trees were inferred using heuristic search options, and various tree statistics were calculated. Clade stability was assessed by bootstrap analysis with multiple replicates. Trees were visualized using appropriate software.
When analyzing ITS and β-tubulin sequences, several reference sequences were obtained from GeneBank. The model of evolution was estimated using MrModelTest 2.2. Posterior probabilities (PP) were determined by Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC) in MrBayes 3.0b4. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 3,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100 generations, resulting in a total of 30,000 trees. The first 2,000 trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining 28,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree.
A representative isolate of each species from Amaryllidaceae was selected for pathogenicity testing. For assessing the host range, 12 plant species were selected from six families, most of which are hosts of Colletotrichum species that are morphologically similar to our isolates from Amaryllidaceae. Single spore cultures of each isolate were grown on PDA for seven days at 25°C. Spores were harvested by adding 10 ml of sterilized distilled water to the culture, which was gently swirled to dislodge the conidia, adjusting the concentration to 10^6 conidia/ml using a hemocytometer. This suspension was used as the standard inoculum for pathogenicity and host range testing. The conidial suspension was filtered through two layers of muslin cloth.
Healthy leaves or fruits were selected, washed with tap water, and disinfected in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5-7 minutes, with the disinfection time adjusted based on surface texture. The disinfected leaves and fruits were washed three times with distilled, sterilized water and then dried with sterilized filter paper. Each sample was placed individually in a 12 cm diameter Petri dish or tissue culture bottle (for tomato and grapefruit) with a cotton swab containing distilled water to maintain humidity. The inoculation method involved pin-pricking the leaf or fruit wall to a depth of 1 mm and then placing 6 µl of the conidial suspension onto the wound or non-wound areas. Control samples were inoculated with 6 µl of sterilized distilled water. Each plant was inoculated with four replicates per selected strain. The inoculated fruits and leaves were then incubated at 25°C for 24 hours and subsequently at room temperature (22-27°C). After 6-7 days and 14-15 days of incubation, leaves and fruits were checked for lesions with a stereo microscope on a superclean bench. Spore masses or acervuli on leaves or fruits were examined with a compound microscope, and spores were transferred to PDA medium and incubated at 25°C to observe colony and spore characteristics. All infected leaves or fruits were sterilized and disposed of.
The Colletotrichum isolates used in this study are documented, with twenty strains collected for analysis.
Colletotrichum was isolated from anthracnose associated with Clivia, Crinum, Hippeastrum, and Hymenocallis (Amaryllidaceae). Morphological examination classified twenty isolates into six morphogroups, while analysis of the ITS sequence revealed eight phylogenetic lineages. For comparison, reference strains of several important Colletotrichum species were included in this study, including Colletotrichum simmondsii, C. truncatum, C. coccodes, C. gloeosporioides, and C. trichellum.
The ITS dataset comprised 570 characters after alignment, of which 138 characters were parsimony informative (24.2%). The Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test showed that 556 trees generated from parsimony analysis were not significantly different. One of the most parsimonious trees (TL = 549, CI = 0.692, RI = 0.867, RC = 0.600, HI = 0.308) is shown in a figure. The dataset of the combined six genes comprised 2,973 characters after alignment.
A detailed description of the table includes sequences obtained for various Colletotrichum species, including their respective strain identifiers, the host organisms they were associated with, the countries of origin, and relevant references. Each entry provides insights into the diversity of Colletotrichum and its relationship with different hosts, highlighting the geographic distribution and potential significance of these fungal species.

The study included various isolates of the genus Colletotrichum, detailing their specimen numbers, host plants, collection sites, and corresponding GeneBank numbers for six genes. The taxa included Colletotrichum cliviae, collected from Clivia miniata in multiple locations in China, with associated GeneBank entries for ITS, β tubulin, CAL, CHS I, GPDH, and Actin genes. Other taxa included C. trunctatum, C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. hippeastri, and several others, each linked to specific host plants and geographical locations. The table captured a rich diversity of Colletotrichum species and their genetic data, essential for further research in fungal diversity and plant pathology.

The descriptive tree statistics of the genes Actin, β-tubulin, CAL, CHS I, GPDH, and ITS were determined using PAUP. A total of 2,973 characters were analyzed, with 1,081 being parsimony informative, representing 36.3%. The results from the phylogenetic analysis indicated that two trees derived from the parsimony analysis were not significantly different. The phylograms based on the combined dataset of the six gene regions support similar topologies, consistent with those obtained from the individual gene analyses of Actin, CHS I, β-tubulin, CAL, and GPDH, thus these results are not presented separately.
Isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose on Amaryllidaceae were categorized into eight clades based on the phylograms from the ITS region. Clade 1 was monophyletic with strong bootstrap support (97%) and included isolates CSSX3, CSSX5, and CSSX10, representing Colletotrichum spaethianum (Allescher) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous. Another monophyletic lineage, clade 2, comprised isolates CSSK4, CSSS1, and CSSS2, which exhibited 100% bootstrap support and appeared as a sister clade to Colletotrichum orbiculare (Berk. & Mont.) Arx. Clade 3 included isolates CSSG1 and CSSG2, which clustered with 96% bootstrap support and were basal to Colletotrichum boninense. Clade 4 included isolates CSSN1 and CSSX8 along with two strains of Colletotrichum boninense (holotype and paratype) from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum, showing 92% bootstrap support. Clade 5 comprised isolates CSSX2, CSSX4, CSSX9, CSST3, and CSST5, forming a distinct lineage with two strains of Colletotrichum truncatum (CBS151.35, epitype, and CBS120709). Clade 6 included isolates CSST1 and CSST4, clustered with type specimens of Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde. The phylogenetic positions of isolates CSSX7, CSSN2, and CSSN3 were uncertain in the ITS tree, with CSSX7 being closely related to C. fructicola Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde.
Phylograms derived from the CAL gene sequences positioned isolate CSSX7 alongside C. fructicola (strain BPD-I16, holotype) in a distinct lineage (clade 7) with 96% bootstrap support. Comparatively, the phylograms from CHS I and ITS indicated that clades 1 to 6 were very similar, with CSSN2 and CSSN3 forming a separate lineage (clade 8) with 67% bootstrap support. Notably, bootstrap support for clade 6 (CSST1 and CSST4) was higher in the CHS I analysis than in the ITS analysis (89% vs. 58%). The position of isolate CSSX7 remained unresolved in this single gene tree. The phylograms from the combined datasets of Actin, β-tubulin, CHS I, CAL, GPDH, and ITS support eight well-defined clades, indicating eight distinct specie
CSSN3 represents a distinct clade (clade 8) with 95% bootstrap support and 100% Bayesian posterior probabilities. Clades 1, 4, 5, 6, and 7 are identified as Colletotrichum spaethianum, C. boninense, C. truncatum, C. siamense, and C. fructicola, respectively. Clades 2, 3, and 8 represent three undescribed Colletotrichum species. Full descriptions and illustrations of these three species are provided in the following taxonomy section.
Eight species of Colletotrichum causing anthracnose of plants in Amaryllidaceae are listed in the accompanying tables. Three of these species are clearly different from all currently known species. The analysis utilized random addition sequences and unweighted parsimony while treating gaps as missing data. Values above the branches in the phylograms represent parsimony bootstrap support (equal to or above 50%). Thickened branches indicate significant Bayesian posterior probabilities (equal to or above 95%). The trees are rooted with appropriate outgroup species.
Fusarium oxysporum ATCC MYA-3970 is noted as an outgroup with high bootstrap support values ranging from 54 to 100 across various comparisons.
A total of 133 species of Colletotrichum have been described and illustrated as new species (Hyde et al., 2009; Sutton, 1992). Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib. is identified in this study, occurring on the leaves of Crinum asiaticum as reddish-brown, ellipsoid to irregular spots, and producing pink conidial masses with rare setae. Although the conidia of C. boninense (CSSN1 and CSSX8) are wider than those of the holotype and paratype, their shape and cultural characteristics are similar, clustering in one clade with high bootstrap support, with a single base difference in the ITS sequence compared to the holotype. The holotype and paratype of C. boninense were collected from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum in Japan.
Material examined: In China, Yunnan Province, Jinghong, on a leaf of Crinum asiaticum, collected on 2 August 2008 by Y.L. Yang (GZAAS 080009, ex-living culture CSSX8); in Guangxi Province, Nanning, on a leaf of Crinum asiaticum, collected on 19 June 2008 by Y.L. Yang (GZAAS 080006, ex-living culture CSSN1).
Colletotrichum cliviae Y.L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, sp. nov., is described with the MycoBank number 515279. The name "cliviae" references the host Clivia miniata. The fungus produces a colony on agar after five days, measuring 7.4-7.7 cm in diameter, appearing white or grey. The margin is greyish-white and dense, with a reverse color ranging from dark brown to pale buff conidial masses. Sclerotia and setae are present, with setae measuring 75-105 × 4-6 µm, brown at the base and tapering to a point. Conidiophores are hyaline, measuring 22.5-49 × 4-5.5 µm, with one to four septa. Conidia appear in pale buff masses, measuring 19.5-24.5 × 4.5-7 µm, aseptate, smooth, and cylindrical with obtuse ends.
The fungus is found on the leaves of Clivia miniata, with acervuli that are circular to elliptical, subepidermal, disrupting the outer cell wall of the host. The setae are moderately brown and smooth-walled, tapering toward the apex. Conidiophores are branched or unbranched, measuring 18-36.5 × 4-6.5 µm. Conidia are smooth-walled and hyaline, measuring 15-24 × 4.5-6.5 µm. The colonies on PDA reach 7.4-7.7 cm in diameter in five days at 25°C, showing a growth rate of 15.2-16 mm per day, starting white and turning grey with age. The sclerotia are present and setose, with the setae being brown, measuring 75-105 × 4-6 µm, 1-3 septate, and tapering to acute apices.

Material examined: CHINA, Guangxi Province, Nanning, on leaf of Crinum asiaticum (GZAAS 080007, ex-living culture CSSX2) and Hymenocallis americana (GZAAS 080010, ex-living culture CSSX9; GZAAS 080014, ex-living culture CSSX4), 19 June 2008, Y.L. Yang; THAILAND, Chiang Rai Province, Fah Luang University, on leaf of Hymenocallis sp., 25 November 2008, Y.L. Yang and K.D. Hyde, ex-living culture CSST3 and CSST5.
Pathogenicity testing and host range: The three new species are not host-specific. Isolate CSSN2 (Colletotrichum hymenocallidis) from Hymenocallis americana can infect fruits of Capsicum annuum and Lycopersicon esculentum through wound/drop inoculation, forming salmon-pink conidial masses without setae. Both non-wound/drop and wound/drop inoculation resulted in leaf infection of Hymenocallis americana, exhibiting symptoms similar to field infection. Isolate CSSG1 (Colletotrichum hippeastri) from Hippeastrum vittatum caused disease on the leaves of Crinum asiaticum through wound/drop inoculation, resulting in reddish-brown spots with acervuli and few setae on Crinum asiaticum leaves. Isolate CSSK4 (Colletotrichum cliviae) can infect Bletilla striata via wound/drop inoculation, leading to numerous pale yellow conidial masses on the leaves. Additionally, CSSK4 can infect Crinum asiaticum through both non-wound/drop and wound/drop inoculation, producing symptoms similar to those observed in the field.
Discussion: The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, Thailand, based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data. A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed, suggesting a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiation. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should form the basis for establishing species relationships. In

Species of Colletotrichum on Amaryllidaceae include Colletotrichum boninense, C. capsici, C. crassipes, and C. dematium, which have been recorded as causing anthracnose in Amaryllidaceae. Colletotrichum boninense was noted as the causal agent of anthracnose on Dracaena sanderiana and Euonymus japonica, and as an endophyte on various hosts worldwide. Recent evidence suggests that C. boninense may represent a species complex. Both C. capsici and C. dematium are known to cause diseases in a range of host plants across tropical and temperate regions. In this study, C. dematium and C. crassipes were not found. Additionally, six other taxa—Colletotrichum cliviae, C. fructicola, C. hippeastri, C. hymenocallidis, C. siamense, and C. spaethianum—were recorded as the causes of anthracnose in Amaryllidaceae.
The following table summarizes the morphological characters of Colletotrichum hippeastri and similar taxa.
The table includes taxa such as Colletotrichum dracaenophilum, C. hippeastri, C. nupharicola, and C. sansevieriae, detailing their colony characteristics, growth rates, conidial shapes and sizes, and conidial appressorium shapes and sizes. For instance, C. hippeastri is described as pale white to black with floccose growth, and its conidia are cylindrical and occasionally curved. The incubation conditions vary among species, with some requiring specific light and temperature settings for optimal growth.
Colletotrichum cliviae is proposed as a new species based on these findings.
Colletotrichum cliviae is similar to C. boninense, C. crassipes, and C. orbiculare in conidial width. However, the conidial shapes differ; conidia of C. crassipes are truncate at the base, while those of C. boninense have a hilum-like low protuberance at the base. Additionally, Colletotrichum cliviae grows faster in culture than C. orbiculare and C. boninense, with growth rates of 15.2-16 mm/day for C. cliviae compared to 10.4-12.2 mm/day for C. boninense and 5.1-5.3 mm/day for C. orbiculare. In the phylogram derived from single and combined multi-gene datasets, three C. cliviae isolates clustered together and were phylogenetically separated from the morphologically similar species.
Conidia of Colletotrichum hippeastri overlap in size with those of C. dracaenophilum, C. sansevieriae, and C. nupharicola. However, C. hippeastri differs in several other characteristics. In C. hippeastri, the conidia are typically narrower near each end or at the center, whereas the conidia of C. dracaenophilum and C. nupharicola do not narrow. Germinating conidia of C. hippeastri form 2-4 cells, which is a distinguishing feature from other Colletotrichum species. The conidia of C. nupharicola become 2-celled, and secondary conidia form from germ tubes. The appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. nupharicola, measuring 10.5-17.5 × 8-12.5 µm compared to 6-10 × 7-9 µm, and they are irregular, crenate, or lobed, while those of C. nupharicola are ovoid to clavate. Additionally, the conidia of C. hippeastri are longer than those of C. sansevieriae, with averages of 29.2 × 8.8 µm versus 18.4 × 6.4 µm. C. sansevieriae is highly host-specific to Sansevieria. Colonies of C. hippeastri grow faster than those of C. dracaenophilum, C. sansevieriae, or C. nupharicola, and other colony characteristics also differ. The ITS sequence of C. sansevieriae is very short (159 base pairs), so it was not included in the ITS phylogenetic analysis. The ITS2 of C. hippeastri and C. sansevieriae have nineteen base differences. Finally, C. hippeastri clustered separately from C. dracaenophilum in phylograms inferred from ITS sequences.
The conidial size and shape of Colletotrichum hymenocallidis are similar to those of C. siamense; however, their colony characteristics differ. The reverse of C. siamense is yellowish white, while that of C. hymenocallidis is greenish black. The conidial and mycelial appressoria in C. hymenocallidis are larger than those of C. siamense. Based on phylograms deduced from CHS I and combined datasets of six genes, they occur in two different clades. Although the conidial size and shape in C. gloeosporioides are similar to those of C. hymenocallidis, the latter grows slower than C. gloeosporioides under the same conditions (10 mm/day in C. hymenocallidis versus 26.5 mm/day in C. gloeosporioides). In the single and combined gene trees, C. hymenocallidis formed a distinct lineage separated from C. gloeosporioides.
Appressorium shape and size are important characteristics for species
Johnson et al. (1997), Chaky et al. (2001), and Crouch et al. (2009) reported that in the present study, we attempted to induce both conidial and mycelial appressoria; however, mycelial appressoria often failed to develop. Conidial appressoria were generally smaller and exhibited less variation in shape compared to mycelial appressoria. Additionally, the induction of mycelial appressoria, particularly in cylindrical-spored species, often required more than 10 days. Therefore, characterizing conidial appressoria is easier, as suggested by Cai et al. (2009).
In the pathogenicity analysis, aside from the three new species, five other species identified in this study have been previously reported from various hosts. Consequently, we selected the three new species for in vitro pathogenicity testing against 12 plants from six families. The results indicated that C. cliviae, C. hippeastri, and C. hymenocallidis are not host-specific, as they can infect two or three different hosts. The virulence potential of Colletotrichum species is influenced by various factors, including plant varieties, humidity, temperature, and inoculum concentration. Thus, the pathogenicity and virulence of these new species require testing in vivo.
Future studies should focus on the Amaryllidaceae, which comprises 51 genera and over 800 species worldwide. A high diversity of Colletotrichum species, including many undocumented new species, can be expected with the examination of additional hosts.
