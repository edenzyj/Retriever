The buffer action of water or an inert medium refers to their ability to resist changes in pH when small amounts of acids or bases are added. Here’s a breakdown:
In summary, both water and inert media contribute to buffering by stabilizing pH levels through their chemical properties and interactions with other substances.
The Nutrient Film Technique (NFT) is a popular hydroponic method used for growing plants without soil. Here's a brief overview of its key features:
Film of Nutrient Solution: In NFT, a thin film of nutrient-rich water circulates over the plant roots. This film provides essential nutrients and oxygen directly to the roots.
Gully System: Plants are usually placed in a sloped channel or gully, allowing the nutrient solution to flow continuously. The slope ensures that the solution drains back into a reservoir, where it is recirculated.
Oxygenation: Since the roots are exposed to air and the nutrient solution, they receive plenty of oxygen, which is vital for plant health.
Water Efficiency: NFT uses significantly less water compared to traditional soil-based growing, making it a sustainable option.
Plant Types: NFT is well-suited for leafy greens and herbs but can be adapted for other types of crops.
NFT is a highly efficient method for growing crops, especially in controlled environments like greenhouses and indoor farms.
Gravel culture is a type of hydroponic system used in plant cultivation, where plants are grown in a medium of gravel or similar inert materials. This method allows for good drainage and aeration while providing support for the plants. Here are some key features and considerations:
Inert Medium: Gravel serves as the main growing medium, providing stability and facilitating root growth without holding moisture like soil.
Nutrient Delivery: Nutrients are supplied through a nutrient solution, which is typically a mix of water and inorganic fertilizers. This solution is delivered to the roots, ensuring they have access to essential minerals.
Aeration: The structure of gravel allows for good air circulation around the roots, reducing the risk of root rot and promoting healthy growth.
Water Management: Gravel culture systems can be designed with drainage to prevent waterlogging. Regular monitoring of moisture levels is crucial.
Scalability: This method can be used for small-scale gardening or larger commercial operations, making it versatile.
Gravel culture is often used for growing vegetables, herbs, and flowers in controlled environments like greenhouses. It’s a popular choice in commercial hydroponic farming due to its efficiency and productivity.

Tannins and acids present in the recently separated coir dust influence plants. Therefore, use coir dust that is at least six months old. Dry, clean, compacted coir dust blocks are available in the market.
The hanging bag technique (open system) involves around 1-meter-long chambers made from white (with black inside) UV-treated, thick polythene bags filled with sanitized coconut fiber. These bags are sealed at the base and attached to a small PVC pipe at the top. They are suspended vertically from an overhead support above a nutrient solution collection channel. This method is also known as the "verti-grow" method. Seedlings or other planting materials established in net pots are inserted into openings on the sides of the hanging bags. The nutrient solution is pumped to the top of each hanging bag through a micro-sprinkler attached inside at the top. This micro-sprinkler evenly distributes the nutrient solution within the hanging bag. The solution drips down, wetting the coconut fiber and plant roots. Excess solution is collected in the channel below through openings made at the base of the hanging bags and flows back to the nutrient solution stock tank. This system can be established in open spaces or in secured structures. In secured structures, the hanging bags in rows and between the lines must be spaced apart to allow adequate sunlight to reach the bags in the inner rows. This method is suitable for leafy vegetables, strawberries, and small flower plants. Black pipes should be used for nutrient solution delivery to prevent mold growth.
In the grow bag technique, 1 to 1.5-meter-long white (with black inside), UV-resistant polythene bags filled with old, disinfected coir dust are used. These bags are around 6 cm in height and 18 cm wide. They are arranged end to end in rows on the floor, allowing walking space in between. The bags can be placed in paired rows depending on the crop to be grown. Small openings are made on the upper surface of the bags, and seedlings or other planting materials established in net pots are pressed into the coir dust. Two to three plants can be established per bag. Two small cuts low on each side of the bags allow for drainage. Fertigation is conducted using a dark narrow pipe leading from the main supply line to each plant. The entire floor is covered with white UV-resistant polythene before setting the bags. This white polythene reflects sunlight onto the plants and reduces humidity between plants, thereby decreasing the incidence of fungal diseases.
In the trench or trough technique, plants are grown in narrow channels in the ground or in above-ground troughs made with bricks or concrete blocks. Both channels and troughs are lined with waterproof materials (thick UV-resistant polythene sheets in two layers) to separate the growing media from the surrounding ground. The width of the channel or trough can be chosen based on ease of operation; wider channels or troughs allow for two rows of plants. The depth varies depending on the plants to be grown, with a minimum of 30 cm typically required. Old coir residue, sand or gravel, peat, vermiculite, perlite, old sawdust, or a mix of these materials can be used as the media for this culture.
Sure! Here’s the revised text:
Figure 8: The trench or trough technique involves a dribble water system framework, although manual application is also feasible depending on work availability. A well-punctured channel of 2.5 cm in diameter may be placed at the bottom of the trough to drain excess nutrient solution. Tall-growing vine plants, such as cucumbers and tomatoes, require additional support to bear the weight of the fruits.
Pot Method: The pot method is similar to trough culture, but the growing medium is filled in mud or plastic pots. The volume of the container and growing media depends on the crop's growth requirements, typically ranging from 1 to 10 liters. The growing media, nutrient solution supply, and plant support are comparable to those in trough culture.
Aeroponic: Aeroponics is a method of growing plants where they are held in holes in Styrofoam boards, with their roots suspended in air below the board. The boards create a sealed box to prevent light penetration, aiding root development and inhibiting algae growth. The nutrient solution is misted in fine droplets to the roots, with moistening occurring for a few moments every 2 to 3 minutes. This is sufficient to keep the roots moist while allowing nutrient solution circulation. Plants receive nutrients and water from the film of solution that clings to the roots. Aeroponic culture is typically practiced in controlled environments and is suitable for low leafy vegetables like lettuce and spinach. A key advantage of this method is the maximized use of space, allowing for twice as many plants per unit floor area compared to other systems. Another potential use of this method is for producing soil-free plants from cuttings for exports.
Figure 9: The aeroponic system is likely the most advanced type of hydroponic planting. In this system, the growing medium is primarily air, with roots exposed to the air and moistened with nutrient solution. Since the roots are similar to those in NFT systems, they can dry out quickly if the misting cycles are interrupted.
Conclusion: Hydroponic culture is rapidly gaining momentum and popularity as the fastest-growing sector of agriculture. It is particularly recognized and accepted in some countries, especially for commercial vegetable production, and is quickly gaining traction in other parts of the world. However, in developing countries, this method has not yet gained popularity among farmers. The primary bottleneck is the lack of standardized information and poor dissemination of available technologies. This review article aims to provide methods for hydroponic techniques to farmers and raise awareness in potential areas at the national level.
