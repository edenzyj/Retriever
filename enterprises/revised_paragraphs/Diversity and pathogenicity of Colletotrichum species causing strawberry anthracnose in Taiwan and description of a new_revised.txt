Diversity and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan and description of a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov.
Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. However, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum species were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis using various genetic markers, including internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), was identified, along with Colletotrichum karstii (6%) and three known species: Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%). The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. In contrast, Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will aid in disease management and resistance breeding.
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) is a popular small fruit crop with high economic and nutritive value, and it is in high demand globally. From 2008 to 2018, the annual worldwide cultivation of strawberries increased from approximately 400,000 to 483,000 hectares. Although strawberries are native to temperate regions, they can also be cultivated in tropical and subtropical areas, sometimes under high-altitude conditions. The land areas devoted to strawberry cultivation in Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Taiwan in 2018 were 1,482 ha, 1,453 ha, 690 ha, 522 ha, and 506 ha, respectively. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum serve as the major inoculum, leading to epidemics of strawberry anthracnose. Upon landing on plant surfaces, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and subsequently penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum species can infect various strawberry tissues, causing black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses may be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can cause the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in the field. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, and the high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall during th
City 10617, Taiwan. *email: thhung@ntu.edu.tw; sst@ntu.edu.tw; clchung@ntu.edu.tw. This period provides a suitable environment for epidemics. From 2010 to 2016, anthracnose crown rot caused the loss of 30–40% of seedlings and approximately 20% of plants after transplanting. Colletotrichum spp. have traditionally been classified based on the shape of the conidia and appressorium, the presence of a seta or perithecium, and cultural characteristics. Using these criteria, early studies reported C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae as strawberry anthracnose pathogens. However, Colletotrichum spp. share similar features, and morphological characteristics can be influenced by environmental factors including culture media, light, and temperature. Therefore, a polyphasic approach based on morphology and genetic characteristics was proposed for the identification of Colletotrichum species. A combination of multiple gene sequences, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), can provide more molecular features to resolve different species in a Colletotrichum species complex. Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex); C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex); and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to be C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and sequences of these species is insufficient for species identification. Recently, based on analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot. To provide accurate information for disease control and resistance breeding, in this study, we aimed to reveal the population composition of the infectious agents associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. Samples collected from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan from 2010 to 2018 were subjected to morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at different temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium as well as the ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the UK and China (Anhui, Hainan—only one isolate, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces, and Beijing and Shanghai cities), which, with the exception of Hainan, are geographical regions located at higher latitudes (30–53°N) relative to Taiwan (24.5°N), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracno
Molecular identification and phylogenetic analysis. Colletotrichum spp. isolates were first identified at the species complex level. Among 52 Colletotrichum spp. isolates sampled from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan, 45 (86.5%) isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 4 (7.7%) belonged to the C. boninense species complex, and 3 (5.8%) belonged to the C. acutatum species complex. To further analyze the C. acutatum species complex, 3 isolates, together with 40 reference isolates, including the outgroup C. orchidophilum, were used to construct phylogenetic trees with five gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, and TUB2). The final data matrix contained a total of 1,821 characters with gaps (ITS: 1–540, GAPDH: 541–799, CHS-1: 800–1,081, ACT: 1,082–1,329, TUB2: 1,330–1,821), of which 237 characters were parsimony informative, 174 parsimony uninformative, and 1,410 constant. After 2,000,000 generations of topological convergence via Bayesian inference (BI) analysis, 2,378 trees were obtained. The first 25% of the trees were discarded, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, and the remaining trees were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. The maximum likelihood (ML) analysis resulted in a best scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of −6,726.174303. The most parsimonious tree from the maximum parsimony (MP) analysis had a tree length of 692, consistency index (CI) = 0.714, and retention index (RI) = 0.843. All three isolates (ML1040, ML1042, ML1794) were grouped in a distinct clade with significant statistical support in the multilocus phylogenetic analysis (1/100/100, BI/ML/MP) and the single gene trees of GAPDH, CHS-1, and TUB2. This clade was distinct from all other known species and is herein described as a new species, C. miaoliense sp. nov.
To analyze the phylogeny of the C. boninense species complex, six gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, and CAL) from 4 isolates, together with 31 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. gloeosporioides, were
The provided data includes a list of species, their respective isolates, and collection details. The species belong to various complexes, such as C. boninense, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum. Each entry includes the isolate number, type of tissue (e.g., leaf, root, crown), the date of collection, the sampling site (mostly in various townships of Miaoli County), and GenBank accession numbers for further genetic information.
For instance, the C. boninense species complex includes multiple isolates collected from leaf tissues in different townships, such as Renai and Taian, over various dates. The C. gloeosporioides complex also lists isolates primarily from Shitan Township, with details on their collection dates and types. Similarly, the C. acutatum complex outlines various crown and root samples collected in the same region, indicating a diverse representation of fungal species collected systematically over time.
The isolate MK908443 was collected from the crown of a strawberry plant in Dahu Township, Miaoli County, on August 15, 2012. Following that, MK908444 was obtained from the leaf in Gongguan Township, Miaoli County, on September 12, 2012. Other samples collected on the same date include MK908445 from the crown, MK908446 from the root, and MK908447 from the crown in Shitan Township. Subsequent samples, such as MK908448 and MK908449, were also collected from crowns in Dahu Township on September 18, 2012, along with MK908450 from the root. More samples, including MK908451 and MK908452, were collected from crowns in Dahu Township on the same day. The last noted sample, MK908453, was collected from the crown in Guoxing Township, Nantou County, on October 4, 2012.
In the single gene trees of GAPDH and CAL, along with the multilocus phylogenetic tree, the isolate ML521 clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 123755 and related isolates of C. boninense. To identify species in the C. gloeosporioides species complex, a combination of seven gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT) from 45 isolates, along with 47 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. boninense (CBS 123755), were utilized to construct phylogenetic trees. The final data matrix comprised a total of 3,571 characters with gaps, of which 655 characters were parsimony informative, 735 were parsimony uninformative, and 2,181 were constant. After 6,574,000 generations of topological convergence through Bayesian inference analysis, 9,864 trees were obtained. The initial 25% of trees were discarded as part of the burn-in phase, and the remaining trees were used to calculate Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree. The maximum likelihood analysis yielded a best scoring RAxML tree with an optimized likelihood value of -18,514.217014. The most parsimonious tree from the maximum parsimony analysis had a tree length of 2,400, a consistency index of 0.722, and a retention index of 0.876. In the single gene trees of TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT, as well as the multilocus phylogenetic tree, 39 isolates clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 130417 and related isolates of C. siamense. The 39 isolates formed a subclade with a high support value. In the single gene trees of GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT, six isolates clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 130416 and related isolates of C. fructicola.
Based on morphological traits and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, the 52 isolates were assigned to five Colletotrichum species, including one new taxon (C. miaoliense sp. nov.), one newly recorded taxon in strawberry (C. karstii), and three species known to be ass
The table summarizes the isolates of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, including information about their collection sites, collection dates, and corresponding gene sequences. Each isolate is listed with its collection information, specifying whether it is a crown, stolon, or leaf sample, and the location in Miaoli or Chiayi County. Notably, isolates in bold are representatives selected for mycelial growth and pathogenicity assays. The abbreviations for genetic markers are explained: ITS refers to the internal transcribed spacer, GAPDH is glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CHS-1 stands for chitin synthase, ACT indicates actin, TUB2 represents beta-tubulin, CAL is calmodulin, and ApMAT refers to the intergenic sequence between Apn2 DNA lyase and MAT1-2-1. The entry marked with a dash indicates that data is not available.
The colony characteristics observed at 25 °C on PDA and 1/4 PDA were predominantly white to grey, with orange conidia exuding from the cultures. Notably, C. siamense ML133 and C. karstii ML351 produced a significant amount of conidia when grown on 1/4 PDA at 25 °C, while C. boninense ML521 yielded more conidia on PDA at the same temperature. Conversely, C. fructicola ML348 and C. miaoliense ML1040 sporulated more on 1/4 PDA at 30 °C. Supplementary Table S2 provides measurements of conidia and appressoria for the five Colletotrichum species examined in this study, with the conidia of C. miaoliense ML1040 being notably longer, exhibiting a length-to-width (L/W) ratio of 3.4 compared to 2.3–3 for the other species.
The new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov., was described by P. C. Chung and H. Y. Wu, with the MycoBank number MB835424. The epithet "miaoliense" refers to Miaoli County, Taiwan, the location of its discovery. The sexual morph was not observed; however, the asexual morph was seen on 1/4 PDA. The vegetative hyphae measured 3–6 µm in diameter, were hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not detected, but sporodochia formed, with conidiophores directly arising from hyphae. These conidiophores were hyaline, smooth-walled, and could be simple or branched. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth-walled, and varied in shape, often integrated or occasionally polyphialidic. Phialides were discrete, measuring 5.9–26.4 µm in length, with an apical opening of 1.1–2.6 µm in diameter. The conidia were hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, a
A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of the C. acutatum species complex was constructed using concatenated sequences of the ITS and the GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1, and TUB2 genes. Bayesian inference (BI) posterior values above 0.9 and bootstrap support values from maximum likelihood (ML) and maximum parsimony (MP) above 70% are indicated at each node (BI/ML/MP). C. orchidophilum CBS 632.80 served as the outgroup. Ex-type strains are marked with an asterisk, and strains isolated in this study are presented in bold.
Seta is absent. Appressoria are single or in loose clusters, pale brown, smooth-walled, elliptical to clavate in shape, with entire edges measuring 5.9–9.1 × 4–6.0 µm (average = 7.5 ± 1.1 × 5 ± 0.6 µm, n = 27), resulting in a length/width ratio of 1.5.
Culture features show that colonies on PDA are flat to somewhat raised with entire margins; the mycelium is partly floccose and varies from white to pale olivaceous grey. Sporodochia are orange and scattered in rings, with the reverse being bright orange to orange. The average diameter after 7 days at 25 °C is 4.2 cm. Conidia ooze was visible as an orange mass.
Material examined includes samples from Taiwan, specifically Miaoli County, Shitan Township, taken from crown rot of Fragaria × ananassa on 28 Oct. 2016, by P.-C. Chung; the holotype is NTUH 20-001-1, with ex-holotype living culture BCRC FU31304 (= NTUCC 20-001-1, ML1040). Additional materials from Nantou County, Renai Township, collected from leaf spots of Fragaria × ananassa on 24 Nov. 2016, and 4 Jul. 2018, are listed as NTUH 20-001-2 and NTUH 20-001-3, respectively, with corresponding living cultures.
Known distribution includes Miaoli and Nantou Counties in Taiwan. Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from these regions. Multi-locus analysis demonstrated that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade, distinct from all other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species reported as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is phylogenetically most closely related to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidia size (16.1 ± 2.3 × 4.9 ± 0.7 µm versus 14.2 ± 1.1 × 4.1 ± 0.34 µm), shape (one end rounded and the other acute versus both ends acute), and appressoria size (8.7 ± 2.5 × 5.5 ± 1.0 µm versus 7.5 ± 1.0 µm).

The shape of appressoria varies among species; for instance, C. miaoliense and C. simmondsii appressoria are elliptical to clavate, while C. nymphaeae appressoria are clavate or irregular in outline, entire, and have an undulate to lobate margin. Compared with C. simmondsii, the conidia of C. miaoliense are longer (mean length 14.2 µm versus 8.1 µm). Additionally, the conidia of C. simmondsii are cylindrical with one end rounded and the other acute, or both ends acute. Although the appressoria of C. miaoliense and C. simmondsii are similar in shape and length-to-width ratio, the appressoria of C. simmondsii are larger.
Effect of temperature on mycelial growth. A representative isolate from each of five Colletotrichum species was grown on PDA at temperatures ranging from 18 °C to 32 °C. The maximum growth rate of C. siamense ML133 was estimated at 27.9 °C, while the maximum growth rates for C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were at 26.0 °C, 26.9 °C, 24.0 °C, and 26.5 °C, respectively. The growth rate of C. boninense ML521 drastically decreased at 32 °C. C. miaoliense ML1040 exhibited the slowest growth rate across all tested temperature regimes, except at 32 °C. The ranking of species by growth rates at higher temperatures (28 °C, 30 °C, and 32 °C) is as follows: C. siamense ML133 > C. fructicola ML348 > C. karstii ML351 and C. boninense ML521 (28 °C and 30 °C) > C. miaoliense ML1040 > C. boninense ML521 (32 °C). The growth rates of C. siamense ML133 were also compared with those of two other representative isolates selected from C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense. The ranking of isolates by mycelial growth rates at both 25 °C and 30 °C on PDA was: C. siamense ML133 and ML540 > C. siamense ML612 and C.
Virulence of the five selected isolates was subsequently assayed using wounded and non-wounded detached leaves at 25 °C and 30 °C. For all five isolates, inoculation of wounded leaves resulted in typical anthracnose lesions, which were first observed at 2–4 days post inoculation (dpi). C. siamense ML133 caused the largest brown necrotic lesions, sometimes with chlorotic or reddish margins. The necrotic lesions caused by C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were significantly smaller, with C. fructicola ML348 being slightly more virulent than C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040. At 7 dpi, C. siamense ML133 caused significantly larger lesions at 30 °C (1.26 cm in diameter) compared to 25 °C (0.65 cm in diameter), whereas the sizes of lesions caused by other Colletotrichum species were similar (0.07–0.35 cm in diameter) at different temperatures. Regarding inoculations of unwounded leaves, necrotic lesions caused by C. siamense ML133 and C. fructicola ML348 first appeared at 4–7 dpi, but no lesions occurred in the plants inoculated with the other three Colletotrichum spp. isolates. Inoculation of unwounded leaves with C. siamense ML133 resulted in larger lesions than inoculation with the other Colletotrichum spp., and the lesion sizes at 14 dpi were significantly larger at 30 °C (1.35 cm in diameter) than at 25 °C (0.35 cm in diameter). Inoculations of wounded leaves were conducted at 30 °C for C. siamense ML133, C. boninense ML521, and two additional representative isolates of C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense. The results showed that C. siamense (ML133, ML540, ML612) and C. fructicola ML356 caused significantly larger lesions (1.21–1.74 cm in diameter at 7 dpi; 3.06–3.47 cm in diameter at 14 dpi) than C. fructicola ML368, C. karstii (ML442, ML1792), and C. miaoliense (ML1042, ML1794) (0.42–0.76 cm in diameter at 7 dpi; 1.06–2.15 cm in diameter at 14 dpi).
Over the past decade, our knowledge of fungi and their relationships with plant hosts has seen exponential growth due to progress in bioinformatics and molecular phylogenetics. Cryptic taxa identification is progressing rapidly, and groups of fungi, including important plant pathogens, are now mainly classified using molecular data-based phylogenetic inference. For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20 species. Several Colletotrichum spp. with the capacity to cause strawberry anthracnose in temperate regions have been reported; however, knowledge of the composition of the pathoge
Inoculation of Colletotrichum spp. on detached wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves at different temperatures showed significant results. Lesions were observed at 7 days post-inoculation (dpi) on wounded leaves and at 14 dpi on non-wounded leaves, with incubation temperatures of 25 °C and 30 °C. The left side of each leaflet was inoculated with 10 μl of spore suspension (10^6 spores/ml), while the right side served as a control with water. Lesion sizes resulting from the inoculation of both wounded and non-wounded leaves were analyzed together at the same temperatures. Data presented as mean ± standard error indicated significant differences based on Tukey’s range test at P < 0.05 (n = 12). For each species, differences between 25 °C and 30 °C were analyzed using Student’s t-test, with asterisks denoting P < 0.05.
The study identified several Colletotrichum species, including C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. siamense, as well as a new species, C. miaoliense, and one not previously known to infect strawberries, C. karstii. Notably, C. karstii had been isolated from a range of other plants, but not from strawberries. In this research, C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. miaoliense were isolated from different plant tissues, confirming the pathogenicity of all five Colletotrichum species to strawberry leaves and crowns. This lack of tissue specificity aligns with previous findings regarding C. acutatum in strawberries.
The predominance of C. siamense (75%) and C. fructicola (11%) in the strawberry anthracnose pathogen population in Taiwan can be attributed to their greater pathogenicity and aggressiveness. While all five Colletotrichum spp. were pathogenic to wounded leaves, only C. siamense and C. fructicola caused lesions on non-wounded leaves. Furthermore, C. siamense and C. fructicola produced significantly larger lesions at both 25 °C and 30 °C. A similar trend was observed in Zhejiang, China, where C. fructicola dominated the population and exhibited the highest pathogenicity.
Although C. boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense were less virulent, natural and human-induced wounds could create potential infection sites for these pathogens, allowing them to overcome the plant's defenses. Among the identified Colletotrichum species, C. siamense displayed superior mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar (PDA), particularly at elevated temperatures. This adaptability in warmer climates may explain the geographical distribution of C. siamense, which is predominantly reported in tropical and subtropical regions, while other species are found across various latitudes.
Temperature plays a crucial role in pathogen survival, and recent studies indicate significant latitudinal shifts in crop pests and pathogens due to climate change. More research is needed on the genetic and biological characteristics of different Colletotrichum species across diverse geographical areas to understand the emergence and spread of anthracnose diseases. With rising global temperatures, monitoring the expansion of heat-adapted C. siamense into higher latitudes will be essential.
C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in different countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum spp. from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could not only infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean but also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is worth investigating whether the five Colletotrichum spp. identified could colonize the weeds commonly present in and nearby strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be required to understand the host range of the new species C. miaoliense. Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other areas. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50–80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings offer precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether it was inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30 °C than at 25 °C, which is meaningful in subtropical Taiwan and areas with a similar phenology. Because no significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, higher disease severity at 30 °C could be due to reduced resistance of strawberry against anthracnose at higher temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Development of temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be particularly important for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating the fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to aid the production of strawberry seedlings without latent infection of major Colletotrichum species.
Methods for sample collection and pathogen isolation involved collecting different strawberry tissues (including leaf, stolon, fruit, root, and crown) showing anthracnose disease symptoms from 24 farms and nurseries located in Miaoli, Hsinchu, Nantou, and Chiayi Counties in Taiwan between 2010 and 2018. From 2009 to 2018, the strawberry-cultivated areas in Miaoli, Hsinchu, Nantou, and Chiayi accounted for approximately 89.6%, 2.8%, 2.6%, and 0.2% of the total strawberry-cultivated area in Taiwan, respectively. Pure cultures of all fungal isolates were obtained using the single hyphal tip isolation method. Approximately 2 × 2 mm fragments bordering healthy and necrotic zones in diseased tissues were surface-sterilized with 0.5–1% sodium hypochlorite, rinsed with sterile deionized water three times, and then placed onto 1.5% water agar. After 2–3 days of incubation at 25 °C, single hyphal tips were transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) and cultured for further use. A total of 52 samples were collected.
Colletotrichum spp. isolates were used in this study. Of the total isolates, 26 (50%) were obtained from crowns, 11 (21.2%) from leaves, 5 (9.6%) from fruits, 5 (9.6%) from roots, and 5 (9.6%) from stolons. Type specimens from this study were deposited in the herbarium of the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University. Ex-type living cultures were stored in the Culture Collection of the Department of Plant Pathology and Microbiology, National Taiwan University, Bioresource and Collection Research Center, and Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station. Nomenclature and taxonomic information were deposited in MycoBank. Colletotrichum spp. were preserved as mycelium discs in distilled water at 4 °C for short-term storage and in 10% glycerol with 5% lactose at −80 °C for long-term storage. Before experiments, each isolate was revived by culturing on PDA for 5–7 days at 25 °C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod.
For DNA extraction, PCR amplification, and sequencing, mycelium was taken from a 7-day-old culture grown on PDA medium. The mycelium was frozen in liquid nitrogen and ground into a fine powder using a sterile mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA was extracted using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System Kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Seven genetic fragments—ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT—were amplified with specific primers using the Biometra Thermal Cycler. Each PCR reaction contained 1 μl of genomic DNA (20–50 ng), 5 μl of 10X reaction buffer, 2 μl of dNTPs (2.5 mM each), 1 µl of 10 µM forward primer, 1 µl of 10 µM reverse primer, 0.5 μl (2.5 U) of Prime Taq DNA Polymerase, and 39.5 μl of distilled water. The thermal cycling parameters included 1 cycle at 95 °C for 4 min and 30–35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 s, 52–62 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 60 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. The optimal annealing temperatures for different genetic regions were: ITS: 58 °C, GAPDH: 52 °C, CHS-1: 58 °C, ACT: 58 °C, TUB2: 58 °C, CAL: 59 °C, and ApMAT: 62 °C. Amplicons were bidirectionally sequenced using the dideoxy termination method. Raw sequence chromatograms were manually examined, and the sequences of each fragment were assembled in ApE.
For multilocus phylogenetic analysis and species recognition, newly generated sequences from each isolate were compared against the GenBank nr database, focusing on type materials for initial species determination. Related gene sequences of Colletotrichum spp. from recent publications were downloaded. For each gene, sequences from isolates belonging to the same species complex were aligned using MAFFT, and the aligned sequences were man
BI, ML, and MP approaches for each individual locus and the concatenated sequences were used to identify closely related taxa. Best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were selected using the Akaike information criterion implemented in MrModeltest v.2.458 and run in PAUP v.4.059. BI analyses were performed using MrBayes v.3.2.660. Two independent analyses of four Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chains (3 heated, 1 cold) were run from a random tree for 2 × 10^6 (for the C. acutatum species complex), 4 × 10^6 (for the C. boninense species complex), and 6 × 10^6 (for the C. gloeosporioides species complex) generations or until the average standard deviation of split frequencies was below 0.01. The analysis was sampled every 1,000 generations, and the first 25% of the generations were discarded as burn-in. The effective sample size and convergence were monitored with Tracer v1.7.161. MP analyses were performed in PAUP v.4.059 using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection branch swapping and 100 random sequence additions. Maxtrees were set to 5,000, and bootstrap analysis was performed with 1,000 replicates. ML analyses were performed in RAxML v8.2.1062 using the GTR-gamma substitution model with 1,000 bootstrap replicates. Phylogenetic trees were visualized in FigTree v1.4.3. The concatenated alignments and phylogenetic trees were deposited in TreeBASE with the study ID 26665. We applied the Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) method for species delimitation of Colletotrichum taxa. A novel species was considered novel if the clade was strongly supported as monophyletic by BI (posterior probability ≥ 0.95), ML (bootstrap ≥ 70%), and MP (bootstrap ≥ 70%) analyses in the multilocus phylogenetic tree and in the majority of individual gene trees.
Morphological characterization of one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species was conducted following the procedures of Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012). Cultures were grown on PDA and 1/4-strength PDA (1/4 PDA) for 2–3 weeks at 25 °C and 30 °C under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. Our preliminary tests showed that compared with PDA, the low nutrient medium 1/4 PDA could stimulate sporulation without affecting the size and shape of conidia. The experiment was performed in two independent trials, each consisting of two to three plates per isolate. Conidiomata were investigated using a dissecting microscope (Leica M125). Conidia, conidiophores, setae, asci, ascomata, and appressoria were examined using a light microscope (Leica DM2500). To induce the formation of appressoria, 20–30 µl of conidial suspension (prepared using sterile dH2O) was dropped onto a microscope slide, covered with a cover slip, then incubated in a moist chamber at 25 °C for 2–3 days. The lengths and widths of 55 conidiogenous cells, 100 conidia, and 30 appressoria were measured using ImageJ software.
Mycelium-agar discs (6 mm in diameter) were cut with a sterilized
The mycelial growth rate was measured after 7 days of incubation at different temperatures under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark photoperiod in a growth chamber. The growth rate (mm/day) was calculated as “(the diameter of the colony - the diameter of the mycelium-agar disc) / 7.” For one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species, the mycelial growth rates at 18 °C, 22 °C, 25 °C, 28 °C, 30 °C, and 32 °C were determined in two to three independent trials, each consisting of three PDA plates per isolate per temperature. The optimum temperature for the mycelial growth rate was estimated using a Gaussian process for nonlinear regression. Growth of two additional representative isolates of each Colletotrichum species, selected based on multilocus phylogenetic analysis, was measured at 25 °C and 30 °C in two independent trials, each consisting of four PDA plates per isolate per temperature.
For the pathogenicity assay, the susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ was used for all inoculation tests. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. was examined via Koch’s postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff and by applying 1 ml of spore suspension on the crown region after removing one to two old leaves. After inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags to maintain over 90% relative humidity for 3 days at 30 °C, then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30 °C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark photoperiod. The fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased tissues using the single hypha tip isolation method and identified based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequences. The virulence levels of different Colletotrichum spp. isolates were determined by inoculating wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Fully expanded healthy leaves were collected from seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage. For inoculation of wounded leaves, each leaflet was punctured with a sterile syringe needle on both sides of the midrib, and 10 μl of a spore suspension was deposited on the left wound site, with sterile dH2O as a control on the right. Non-wounded leaves were inoculated in the same manner. After inoculation, the leaves were kept in a moist chamber at 25 °C or 30 °C under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark photoperiod. Lesion size was measured at 7 and 14 days post-inoculation (dpi), with lesions smaller than 0.1 cm in diameter considered unsuccessful infections. The same isolates used for the mycelial growth test were employed in the pathogenicity assay. For one selected isolate from each Colletotrichum species, inoculations of wounded and non-wounded leaves were performed at 25 °C and 30 °C in three independent trials, each consisting of 12 leaflets (4 leaves from 4 seedlings) per isolate per treatment. Two additional representative isolates of each Colletotrichum species were used for wound inoculation at 30 °C in two independent trials, each with 12 leaflets per isolate per treatment. Data were analyzed using analysis of variance (ANOVA) with
Tukey’s range test or Student’s t-test was used to test for significant differences among or between different treatments at a significance threshold of P < 0.05. Received: 9 June 2020; Accepted: 3 August 2020.
