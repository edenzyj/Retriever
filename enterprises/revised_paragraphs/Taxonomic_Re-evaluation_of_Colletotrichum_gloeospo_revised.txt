For the past two decades, the causal agent of anthracnose occurring on strawberry in Korea was considered to be Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, recent molecular analyses have shown that the genus Colletotrichum has undergone many taxonomic changes with the introduction of several new species. As a result, it has been revealed that C. gloeosporioides actually consists of more than 20 distinct species. Therefore, the Korean pathogen isolated from strawberries should be reclassified. The shape and size of the conidia of the pathogen were not distinctly different from those of C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola, but it differed in the shape of the appressoria. A combined sequence analysis of partial actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, and the internal transcribed spacer regions showed that the strawberry isolates formed a monophyletic group with authentic strains of C. fructicola. Based on these results, the anthracnose fungi of domestic strawberries in Korea were identified as C. fructicola and distinguished from C. gloeosporioides.

Anthracnose crown rot, to which all currently grown strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) cultivars are susceptible, is a major disease affecting over 30% of nurseries and the transplanting stage in Korea. The causal pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was first reported by Kim et al. in 1992. C. gloeosporioides occurs in many crops and is a species aggregate containing a number of polymorphic subgroups that show varying degrees of pathogenicity, host specificity, and genetic homogeneity. However, the recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides has enabled accurate classification through comparative analysis with pathogens isolated from various plants. The sequence analysis of the type strains has been an important element in the research of identification and phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum. Anthracnose pathogens previously reported as Colletotrichum sp. that occur on coffee in Thailand have been identified as three new species: C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense, based on multi-gene sequence analysis and morphological characteristics. In recent years, anthracnose pathogens from tropical fruits that were identified as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological characteristics have been subdivided into C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. horii, C. kahawae, and C. gloeosporioides by comparing nucleotide sequences with that of the C. gloeosporioides epitype. Consequently, many species of Colletotrichum, including C. gloeosporioides, have been defined primarily based on results from molecular phylogenetic analysis. Although the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequence does not separate the C. gloeosporioides complex, some single genes or combinations of genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and glutamine synthetase, can reliably distinguish most taxa.
Therefore, C. gloeosporioides, previously reported as a pathogen on strawberries in Korea, needs to be re-evaluated, considering the changed species boundary and the recent phylogenetic results of the genus Colletotrichum.
Isolation and culture of strains involved eleven strains isolated from strawberry plants between 2005 and 2011. Diseased petiole, roots, and crown tissues were surface sterilized by dipping in 2% NaOCl for 2 minutes, rinsed three times with sterile water, and dried on sterile tissue paper. Samples were then placed on water agar and incubated at 27 °C. The growing edges of any fungal hyphae that developed from the tissue were aseptically transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA). Single spore isolations were carried out using the procedure described by Prihastuti et al. (2009). Pure cultures were stored at 4 °C on PDA slants.
For the pathogenicity test, each isolated pathogen was prepared at a concentration of 1 × 10^5 conidia/mL and sprayed with 1 mL per plant on the Seolhyang cultivar of strawberry plants. Six plants per isolate were used for the test. The inoculated plants were incubated in a dew plastic house at 27 °C and 100% relative humidity (RH) for two days, after which they were moved to a plastic house held between 24 °C and 30 °C. After 60 days, the disease index on each plant was rated on a scale of 0–4: 0 for healthy, 1 for less than 50% of petioles affected, 2 for more than 50% of petioles affected, 3 for wilted, and 4 for necrosis formed on the entire plant. Disease index data from isolates were subjected to analysis of means and standard error, performed using the Costat program. All isolates caused anthracnose symptoms on the Seolhyang strawberry cultivar. The disease index of the isolates was highest (DI > 3) for CGF071204, CGF100713, and CGF110101.
Smith and Black (1990) showed that the pathogenicity of C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae can be differentiated by factors such as strawberry tissue and cultivars. C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were reported to have a wide host range, while C. fragariae was restricted to strawberry plants. Colletotrichum isolated from strawberries in Korea and Japan was pathogenic to strawberry and apple fruit, and also to avocado, broad bean, common sowthistle, cyclamen, pea, and strawberry under non-wound inoculation conditions.
Morphological and cultural characteristics of the isolates were measured for colony characteristics, as well as the shape and size of the colonies.
In the study, various Colletotrichum isolates were tested for their pathogenicity and morphological characteristics. The isolates were categorized based on the year they were collected, the cultivar of strawberry they were associated with, the plant part from which they were isolated, and their origin. Each isolate's pathogenicity was assessed using a disease index (DI) that ran

Colletotrichum was isolated from strawberry after 7 days of incubation on PDA media. The colony diameters were measured daily for 7 days, and the growth rate for these 7 days was calculated as the average of mean daily growth (mm per day). The colors of the conidial masses and zonation were recorded at 7 days. Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, where a conidial suspension was placed in a hole on the glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The slide was placed in an empty Petri dish with wet filter paper and incubated at 28 °C for 2–4 days. Colonies of the isolates on PDA first appeared as white, then became grey to dark grey at the center over time, with a growth rate of 9.98 ± 1.8 mm per

Nam et al. were different from circular to slightly irregular in the latter species. The size of conidia and appressoria of the strawberry isolate differed from C. fragariae as noted by Gunnell and Gubler (1992). Therefore, Colletotrichum isolates from strawberries in Korea were similar to C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola in shape and size of conidia, but the shape of the appressoria was closer to C. fructicola rather than C. gloeosporioides.
For phylogenetic analysis, sequences of eleven strains from strawberry and the ex-type or authentic strains of anthracnose available from GenBank were used in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted using the method of Park et al. (2005). Amplification of the ITS, partial actin (ACT), and GAPDH genes utilized three different primer sets: ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990); ACT512F and ACT783R (Prihastuti et al., 2009); and GDF1 and GDR1 (Peres et al., 2008). The amplification was performed with Maxime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PreMix (I-Taq, iNtRoN BioTechnology, Korea) in a final volume of 20 μl containing 10 pmol of each primer set, with PCR conditions as described by Prihastuti et al. (2009). PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified using a PCR quick-spin purification kit (iNtRON BioTechnology, Korea) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Nucleotide sequences were determined by Bioneer Corporation (Chungwon, Korea). The sequences were proofread, edited, and merged onto comparable sequences using the PHYDIT program version 3.2 (Chun, 1995).
To determine the phylogenetic positions of the Colletotrichum isolates, the alignments of the three gene sequences of 11 Korean isolates and 34 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank were performed with Clustal X 1.81 (Thompson et al., 1997). Nucleotide sequences were aligned manually where necessary. A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in MEGA v. 5.05, using TN93+I, which was selected as the most suitable nucleotide model by Modeltest (Tamura et al., 2011). Bootstr
Korean isolates (K2) were analyzed for 3nt polymorphic characters at positions 47, 57, and 117. The GAPDH sequence of K1 showed a 99.5% similarity with C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921, while K2 exhibited a 99.1% similarity with C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and C. fructicola ICMP 18646. The combined analysis revealed that the 11 strains isolated from Korea formed a monophyletic group with authentic C. fructicola strains (ICMP 18581, ICMP 18646, and ICMP 17921) and were clearly distinct from other members of the C. gloeosporioides complex. All isolates were divided into two subgroups: the first subgroup (K1) included two Korean isolates and C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921, with a bootstrap value of 77%. The second subgroup (K2) comprised nine Korean isolates along with C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and C. fructicola ICMP 18646, showing a bootstrap value of 63%.
C. fructicola was first isolated from Coffea arabica berries in Chiang Mai, Thailand (Prihastuti et al., 2009), and has since been found in tropical fruits such as chili, papaya, and longan (Phoulivong et al., 2010). Recently, G. cingulata var. minor and C. ignotum were synonymized with C. fructicola (Weir et al., 2012). K1 was more closely related to C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921 (syn. G. cingulata var. minor) from Ficus than K2, while K2 grouped with C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and C. fructicola ICMP 18646 (syn. C. ignotum).
