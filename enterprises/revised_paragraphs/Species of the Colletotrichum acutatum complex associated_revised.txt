Abstract
Although C. acutatum was recently investigated and shown to be a species complex comprising about 30 species, the name is still used in its broad sense for anthracnose pathogens of fruits in Brazil. In this study, a multilocus molecular analysis was conducted based on a dataset of ITS, HIS3, GAPDH, CHS-1, TUB2, and ACT sequences of Colletotrichum strains belonging to the C. acutatum species complex from fruits collected in different regions in Brazil, combined with sequences of ex-type and other reference strains of species belonging to this complex. The strains were found to belong to C. nymphaeae, C. melonis, C. abscissum, and one new species, namely C. paranaense, from apple and peach. Morphological descriptions of the new species and a strain closely related to but diverging from C. melonis are provided. From the available data, the most common species on apple fruits in Brazil is C. nymphaeae. In a pathogenicity test, strains of all four species caused lesions on detached apple, peach, and guava fruits, except for strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava fruits.

1. Introduction
Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, especially in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts. The most common symptoms associated with Colletotrichum infections are sunken necrotic lesions, on which orange conidial masses are often produced, referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum species are major pathogens associated with pre- and post-harvest fruit diseases, causing yield losses primarily in tropical and subtropical areas. For example, bitter rot is considered one of the most important diseases of apple fruit, which can cause up to 50% yield loss.
In the pre-molecular era, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species was predominantly based on morphological and cultural characters such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, colony color, and growth rate. However, these characteristics are not always reliable for species differentiation due to their variability under changing environmental conditions. To date, much attention has also been given to conidium morphology, particularly shape and dimensions. For instance, the acute conidial ends resulting in the typical fusiform shape are considered one of the most important morphological features of C. acutatum. However, the name C. acutatum was applied to many species with various fusiform conidia, most of which are closely related to C. acutatum sensu stricto. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation within the species and even among strains of the same species.
Several studies have demonstrated that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For example, isolates from Lupinus spp. formed different proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in rather cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent study, many strains previously identified as C. gloeosporioides based on their cylindrical conidia were revealed to belong to different species of the C. acutatum complex. Furthermore, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae.
Colletotrichum acutatum is known to be genetically highly variable and has been divided into infraspecific groups based on molecular data. It was later suggested to be a species complex, with separate species accepted, including C. clavatum, C. fioriniae, and C. phormii. Recently, the C. acutatum species complex was revised using a multilocus molecular approach on a large number of strains from numerous hosts worldwide, recognizing 31 species. Bitter rot of apple is a serious disease of this crop caused by numerous species within the C. acutatum species complex. Colletotrichum fioriniae seems to be the species most frequently associated with apples in the USA, while strains from New Zealand belong to C. acerbum, C. fioriniae, C. pyricola, and C. salicis. Most of the Colletotrichum strains from apple causin
C. fioriniae and some as C. clavatum (synonym of C. godetiae) based on ITS sequences (Ivic et al. 2012). A first report of apple bitter rot in the United Kingdom has also been associated with C. godetiae (Baroncelli et al. 2014). A further strain had the same ITS sequence as strains BBA 65797 and IMI 345581, the latter previously identified as C. salicis by Damm et al. (2012). However, related species may have the same ITS sequence, as this locus is not always informative at the species level in the C. acutatum species complex. Other strains from apples in Europe included in the study of Damm et al. (2012) also belong to C. fioriniae and C. godetiae. In contrast, strains from apple in Japan identified by Sato and Moriwaki (2013) based on a multilocus analysis belong to C. nymphaeae and C. godetiae. Strains from bitter rot of apple in Korea in the study of Lee et al. (2007) probably belong to C. fioriniae and a species of the C. acutatum clade 2 (C. nymphaeae and related species) according to Damm et al. (2012). However, previously isolated strains from apple and other fruits from Brazil belonging to the C. acutatum species complex were only identified as C. acutatum s. lat. (González et al. 2006; Giaretta et al. 2010). If sequences of these strains were generated at all, only ITS sequences are available that do not allow accurate species identification within this complex. Therefore, the name C. acutatum is still used in its broad sense in Brazil (Serra et al. 2011; De Souza et al. 2013; Barquero Quirós et al. 2013; Ciampi-Guillardi et al. 2014). To date, only a few studied species within the C. acutatum species complex occurring in Brazil have been identified, including a disease report of C. nymphaeae causing apple bitter rot in southern Brazil (Velho et al. 2014). The aim of the present study, therefore, was to identify Colletotrichum strains belonging to the C. acutatum species complex associated with different fruit crops from different localities in Brazil by means of multilocus molecular as well as morphological data, and to describe the new species encountered.
The conditions for PCR of ITS were the same as described by Woudenberg et al. (2009), while those for the other genes were carried out with an initial denaturation step at 94 °C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94 °C, 30 seconds at 52 °C, and 30 seconds at 72 °C, with a final step at 72 °C for 7 minutes. The amplicons were visualized in 1% agarose gels stained with GelRed™. Sequencing was performed using the BigDye terminator sequencing kit v.3.1 and an ABI PRISM® 3100 DNA sequencer. The forward and reverse sequences generated were assembled using the software SeqMan v.9.0.4. Sequences of 59 ex-type and other reference strains of species belonging to the C. acutatum complex, as well as C. orchidophilum CBS 632.80 (as outgroup), all available on GenBank, were added to the dataset, and the sequences aligned with MAFFT v.6.7. The multiple sequence alignment was manually edited with MEGA v.5.2. Evolution models were estimated in MrModeltest v.3.7 using the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each locus. A Bayesian inference was used to reconstruct the phylogeny based on the multilocus alignment (ITS, HIS3, GAPDH, CHS-1, TUB2, and ACT). The partitioned analysis was performed twice in MrBayes v.3.2 using the Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian posterior probabilities. Four MCMC chains were run simultaneously for random trees for 1 × 10^7 generations. Samples were taken every 1000 generations. The first 25% of trees were discarded as a burn-in phase of each analysis, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. Sequences derived in this study were lodged in GenBank, the alignment in TreeBASE, and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank.
Strains were cultivated on synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA) with autoclaved filter paper and Anthriscus sylvestris stems placed on the surface, as well as on oatmeal agar medium (OA). The cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements of morphological characters were made according to Damm et al. (2007). Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, and 30 measurements per structure were made for each strain using a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope and a Nikon Eclipse 80i compound microscope with differential interference contrast illumination. Appressoria were observed on the reverse side of the plates containing SNA medium. Unless mentioned otherwise, descriptions are based on the ex-type strains, and only conidia from conidiomata were included in the morphological examination. Colony characteristics on SNA and OA medium were observed after the incubation period. To calculate the growth rates, the diameters of colonies were measured after 7 and 10 days. Colony colors were determined according to Rayner.
To verify whether the species identified in this work are different in virulence or aggressiveness, a pathogenicity test was conducted by inoculating physiologically mature peach (Prunus persica cv. ‘Chimarrita’), apple (Malus domestica cv. ‘Gala’), and guava (Psidium guajava cv. ‘Pedro Sato’) fruits. The maturation stage of the fruits was standardized based on peel color and pulp firmness using a colorimeter and a penetrometer, respectively. Prior to inoculation, the fruits were immersed in a 0.5% sodium hypochlorite solution for 3 minutes, then rinsed twice in sterile distilled water and air-dried in the laminar flow cabinet. Strains CBS 134727, CPC 20897, CPC 134729, CPC 134730, CPC 134728, and Col 20 were grown on PDA for 7 days at 26 °C under near UV light (12-hour photoperiod) to induce sporulation. After incubation, spores were harvested by adding 10 ml of sterile distilled water to each culture and scraping the surface with a sterile brush. The resulting spore suspensions were filtered through sterile cheesecloth, and the spore concentration was adjusted to 1 × 10^5 mL^-1 using a hemocytometer. The fruits were placed in a plastic box with a lid containing water-soaked cotton wool and inoculated by wounding the fruits with a sterile needle and placing 40 µL of spore suspension on the wound. Control fruits were inoculated with sterile distilled water. The plastic boxes were kept in an incubation room at 25 °C with a 12-hour photoperiod. After 48 hours, the lid of the box was removed, and the boxes remained in the room for another 5 days. On the 7th day, the lesion size was measured, and the fungus was re-isolated from the margin of the lesion. The experimental design was randomized with 10 fruits (replicates). Lesion length data were subjected to analysis of variance using the statistical program “R” v. 3.0.1, and the means of each treatment were compared using Tukey’s test at 95% probability.
The molecular analysis of 76 isolates of C. acutatum s. lat. and the outgroup (C. orchidophilum, strain CBS 632.80) was performed on a sequence alignment with 2222 characters, of which 1702 were conserved, 200 were parsimony-uninformative, and 320 were parsimony-informative. The gene boundaries were: ITS: 1–549, HIS3: 550–936, GAPDH: 937–1203, CHS-1: 1204–1482, TUB2: 1483–1974,
CBS 134728 from Prunus, also grouped (BPP of 0.97) with this clade, was recognized as a new species named C. paranaense. Strain CBS 134727 from Psidium grouped with two isolates described in previous studies as the causal agents of postbloom fruit drop (PFD) of sweet orange in Florida, USA, and with a strain also from sweet orange but isolated in Brazil, recently described as C. abscissum.
3.2. Taxonomy
Based on the multilocus molecular analysis, the strains studied here belong to four species within the C. acutatum species complex, including one species that is new to science and is described below. Additionally, descriptions are provided for strain CBS 134730, treated as C. cf. melonis, and the strain CBS 134727, recognized as the new species described by Pinho and Pereira (2015).
3.2.1. Colletotrichum cf. melonis
Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 1.5–4 µm in diameter, hyaline to buff, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, unbranched, and up to 9 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, ampulliform to cylindrical, often constricted at the base, measuring 3.5–4 x 5.5–17.5 µm, with openings 1–1.5 µm in diameter and a collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, with visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical to clavate, with both ends acute, and sometimes one end rounded, measuring (7–)9–13(–16) x (3–)3.5–4.5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.1 ± 2.2 x 3.9 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 2.8. Appressoria are single, medium to pale brown, bulbous-shaped to clavate, and sometimes globose to obovoidal, with edges entire or sometimes lobate, measuring (4.5–)6–14.5(–20.5) x (4–)4.5–6(–7) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.4 ± 4.1 x 5.4 ± 0
The blastn searches on GenBank with the TUB2, ACT, and HIS3 sequences of strain CBS 134730 (99% identity) revealed that none were identical; they differ in 4 nucleotides (nt), 1 nt, and 3 nt, respectively. The GAPDH and ITS sequences of strain CBS 134730 were identical to those of Colletotrichum strain CBS 129823 from Passiflora edulis, while its CHS-1 sequence matched 100% with a sequence from strain CBS 330.75 from Coffea arabica, the ex-holotype strain of C. costaricense. Despite these sequence differences, we refrain from describing strain CBS 134730 as a new species here, as it is only known from a single strain; it is possible that intermediate strains exist between Col 20 and CBS 134730, as both strains were isolated from apple in Brazil.
3.2.2. Colletotrichum paranaense C.A.D. Bragança & Damm, sp. nov. (MycoBank no.: MB814541). Etymology: Named after the state of Brazil where the species was found, Paraná. Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–2.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata not developed; conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, unbranched, and 5–21 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, elongate-ampulliform to subcylindrical, measuring 4.5–21.5 x 1.5–2 µm, with an opening of 1 µm in diameter, and a collarette of 1–1.5 µm long, sometimes not visible; periclinal thickening is sometimes visible. Conidiogenous cells of strain IMI 384185 differ by being broader, measuring 7–14 x 2–3.5 µm, and frequently forming polyphialides. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, cylindrical, sometimes slightly constricted in the middle, with both ends slightly acute or one end round, measuring (4–)8–15(–22.5) x (2–)3–4(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 11.4 ± 3.6 x 3.4 ± 0.6 µm and a length/width ratio of 3.4. Appressoria are single, medium to pale brown, ellipsoidal to obovoidal, with edges that are entire or sometim
Prunus persica, 2010, H. Tozze, culture CBS 134728 = CPC 20928 = Col 49. Notes: The closest described species to C. paranaense were C. limetticola, C. costaricense, and C. melonis. The original strain of C. limetticola exhibited longer and branched conidiophores, with polyphialides rarely observed and a greater length/width (L/W) ratio. C. costaricense also showed branched conidiophores, a greater L/W ratio, larger conidia, appressoria observed in small groups, setae present, and undeveloped conidiomata. C. melonis displayed branched conidiophores that degenerated rapidly, with visible periclinal thickening, no observed polyphialides, and smaller, rarely acute conidia. Colletotrichum paranaense can be distinguished from other Colletotrichum species by its unique TUB2 and HIS3 sequences. The closest matches in BLASTN searches on GenBank with the TUB2, GAPDH, and HIS3 sequences of strain CBS 134729 were sequences from Colletotrichum strain IMI 384185, associated with Caryocar brasiliense, that is included in this study and considered as C. paranaense. However, the TUB2 and HIS3 sequences also matched with C. abscissum (99% identical, 4 nucleotide differences) and C. cuscutae (1 nucleotide difference). The GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 134729 was identical to that of Colletotrichum strain CBS 129821 from Passiflora edulis. The CHS-1 sequence was the same as that of C. costaricense and was 99% identical to C. paranaense strain IMI 384185. The ITS region shows intraspecific differences; CBS 134728 has an identical sequence to C. limetticola CBS 114.14, while the other two strains (CBS 134729 and IMI 384185) have unique sequences showing two different nucleotides compared to the dataset used in this study.
3.2.3. Colletotrichum abscissum. Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae are 2–3.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores are not observed. Conidiomata are not developed, and conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, sometimes branched, and range from 10 to 29 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, elongate-ampulliform, measuring 5–17.5 x 2–3 µm, sometimes integrate
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire edge, buff in color, and the filter paper is partly covered by olivaceous felty aerial mycelium. The stem of Anthriscus is partly covered by felty aerial mycelium and partly orange due to conidia mass; the reverse side displays the same colors. The growth rate is 21–22.5 mm in 7 days and 31–32.5 mm in 10 days. Colonies on OA are flat to umbonate with an entire edge, olivaceous to pale olivaceous, and partly covered by white to olivaceous grey floccose-felty aerial mycelium; the reverse is pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey. The growth rate is 17–17.5 mm in 7 days and 28–28.5 mm in 10 days. Conidia appear in mass as saffron.
Specimen examined: BRAZIL, Paraná, Cafelândia, from fruit anthracnose of Psidium guajava, 2008, H. Tozze.
Notes: Colletotrichum abscissum was described by Pinho et al. from Citrus sinensis, causing postbloom fruit drop in Brazil. Two strains examined by the authors grouped in a well-supported clade with the ex-type strain COAD 1877. Differences were found between the original strain described by Pinho & Pereira and the strain described in this study. The original strain did not show polyphialides, and the conidia were smaller; appressoria from CBS 134727 were larger and some were clavate. The sequences from the strain examined in this study matched 100% with C. abscissum. The TUB2 sequence matched with those of C. costaricense (99% identity) and Colletotrichum sp. strain CBS 129810 (99% identity). The closest matches with the CHS-1 sequence were Colletotrichum strains CBS 129810 from Solanum betaceum (100% identity) and CBS 101611 from a fern (99% identity). The ITS sequence is identical to strain GM59a and 99% identical to Colletotrichum strain Q003 from Rubus glaucus in Colombia.
Damm et al. described a species from guava in India, C. guajavae, which belongs to a different clade within the C. acutatum species complex than C. abscissum. Morphological differences were also observed, as setae were present in C. guajavae but not in C. abscissum. Peres et al. isolated a C. acutatum strain from guava in Brazil with the same ITS sequence as C. guajavae. Another Colletotrichum species on guava, C. psidii, was described in Italy and belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex.
Aggressiveness test: All tested strains were able to infect their original host and all other hosts included, except for C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava fruits, while no lesions were formed on control fruits. However, there were differences in the size of the lesions and the frequency of infected fruits. None of the strains formed larger lesions on their original host com
Colletotrichum melonis (Col 20) caused larger lesions on peach than C. paranaense (CBS 134728), C. abscissum (CBS 134727), and C. nymphaeae (CPC 20897). Colletotrichum abscissum showed no difference in lesion size between peach and guava. That strain infected only one apple, with lesion sizes smaller than those caused by most other strains tested. Colletotrichum melonis strain Col 20 infected all inoculated guava fruits, while C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730 infected only peach and apple. Additionally, C. nymphaeae strain CPC 20897 formed smaller lesions on guava fruits than C. paranaense strain CBS 134728.
Discussion
A large number of Colletotrichum species belonging to the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes were recently differentiated, some of them being associated with fruit diseases of apple, including bitter rot. In most previous studies on apples in Brazil, the causal agents of bitter rot were reported as C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum (or its sexual morph Glomerella acutata), referring to these species in their broad sense as species complexes. Some of these studies have shown high genetic variability among strains causing apple bitter rot in Brazil. Based on ITS sequences, strains from bitter rot of apple were differentiated into five main clades, indicating the disease is caused by several species within the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides complexes. Our study on C. acutatum s. lat. strains from fruits in Brazil confirms at least three species of this complex associated with apple fruit diseases.
In the study of Damm et al. (2012), most of the C. acutatum s. lat. strains from apple (mainly originating from the USA) were identified as C. fioriniae, with a few strains each as C. acerbum, C. godetiae, C. salicis, and C. nymphaeae, the latter appearing more important on other hosts, especially strawberries. The only C. nymphaeae strain from apple included in Damm et al. (2012) was also the only strain from apple in South America in their study and originated from Brazil. Velho et al. (2014) tested strains of this species collected in southern Brazil for their ability to cause apple bitter rot. Our study suggests C. nymphaeae to be the most important species of the C. acutatum complex associated with anthracnose diseases of apple in Brazil.
Based on ITS sequences, more than half of the C. acutatum strains from apple in the study by Giaretta et al. (2010) and strains from a disease report of bitter rot of apple in Uruguay belong to the same main clade within this species complex and might represent C. nymphaeae as well. The C. nymphaeae strains from Brazil included in this study formed a subclade within C. nymphaeae that slightly separates them from strains from other host plants. Furthermore, sequences of strains in this study formed additional subclades, showing the genetic diversity within the species.
Colletotrich
Damm et al. (2012) describes closely related species predominantly occurring on various hosts in Central and South America, well distinguished by GAPDH and TUB2 sequences. C. lupini, originally described as Gloeosporium lupini on Lupinus albus in Brazil (Bondar 1912), is a commonly occurring species worldwide (Nirenberg et al. 2002; Damm et al. 2012). It is likely that the speciation of C. lupini developed in South America and spread with the host plant to other parts of the world. Some strains from apple in this study were identified as C. melonis and a new species, C. paranaense. ITS sequences place the remaining strains occurring on apple in Brazil, as studied by Giaretta et al. (2012), in the same main clade, although identification at the species level is not possible based on this data. No species in this main clade of the C. acutatum species complex was previously associated with diseases of apple, peach, or guava fruits. Additionally, none of the other four species of the C. acutatum complex from apple reported by Damm et al. (2012) from other regions was found to be associated with apples in Brazil. These species (C. acerbum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, and C. salicis) were not reported from South America, except for a few C. godetiae strains from other hosts in Chile, Colombia, and Mexico, which formed an interspecific clade within C. godetiae. Thus, the species composition of the C. acutatum complex associated with apple bitter rot in Brazil (and possibly in South America) differs from other regions in the world, which may be significant for plant quarantine.
Strain CBS 134727 of C. abscissum grouped with strains causing citrus postbloom fruit drop. This strain was collected from guava fruit with anthracnose in a commercial orchard in Cafelândia city. A previous study revealed that this strain is pathogenic to citrus, causing citrus postbloom fruit drop in 70% of inoculated flowers (Ramiro et al., unpublished data). Guava volatiles are repellent to Diaphorina citri, the vector of citrus huanglongbing (HLB) (Zaka et al. 2010), and intercropping citrus with guava is considered a strategy to control HLB (Beattie et al., 2006). However, the fact that guava can host C. abscissum has obvious epidemiological consequences for citrus postbloom fruit drop outbreaks.
All strains tested for pathogenicity on fruits in this study were able to infect different fruit hosts, though they differed in their aggressiveness. Several studies have demonstrated the lack of host specificity among Colletotrichum species infecting fruits (Peres et al. 2002; MacKenzie et al. 2009; L
Regarding the species isolated from apple, none seemed to be specific to apple fruits. Based on our pathogenicity data, they can potentially infect peach and guava (with the exception of C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava at all), and there is no difference in virulence among the three species on apple. Colletotrichum nymphaeae was recently identified among strains in the NIAS Genbank from multiple hosts, including several strains from apple and peach in Japan (Sato & Moriwaki 2013). This species caused lesions on fruits of all three hosts tested and apparently also occurs on all of them in nature. Although C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae both have a large host range, with some overlapping hosts, there could still be differences in pathogenicity and aggressiveness, as suggested by the results of MacKenzie et al. (2009).
The species newly reported in this paper have so far only been isolated from apple, peach, and pequi (Caryocar brasiliense). However, they were found to be potentially pathogenic also on guava in this study. Future studies will determine if C. paranaense occurs on this host in nature. Understanding the cross-infection ability of a species is important for investigating its potential host range and supporting quarantine measures (Phoulivong et al. 2012). The possible plurivorous nature of the species identified in this study might be one reason for the cross-pathogenicity of the tested strains. Another reason could be the inoculation technique and incubation conditions of the pathogenicity test, which might create more favorable conditions for infection than typically occur in nature. Although wound infection is common in pathogenicity tests on fruits (Cai et al. 2009; Peng et al. 2013), it could have influenced the virulence of the strains. For example, inoculation experiments by von Arx and van der Velden (1961) showed that the number of fruit hosts infected by C. orbiculare and "Glomerella cingulata" (likely C. gloeosporioides s. lat.) was much higher after wound inoculation compared to non-wounding.
The Bayesian tree obtained in this study suggests high genetic variability among the species occurring in Brazil. This can be important knowledge for developing control strategies. For instance, a plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information can be used to predict how long a control measure is likely to remain effective (McDermott & McDonald 1993). Additionally, correct identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific groups of chemical compounds than others (Freeman et al. 1998; Wong & Midland 2007; Sanders et al. 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al. 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for their sensitivity to specific fungicides. Furthermore, accurate identification of pathogens can enhance our understanding of their epidemiology and infection strategies, providing crucial knowledge for breeding resistant cultivars.

The table outlines the pathogenicity test of various Colletotrichum species on peach, guava, and apple fruits. Each species is identified by its strain and original host, with measurements of lesion size (in mm²) and frequency of infection presented for each fruit type. For instance, C. melonis exhibited the largest lesions on apple, while C. cf. melonis showed a notable size difference between apple and guava, with guava having no lesions. The frequency of infection details the number of infected fruits relative to those inoculated, providing insights into the virulence of each species across the three fruit types. Statistical significance is indicated with letter annotations, where lowercase letters denote differences within columns and uppercase letters indicate differences within rows, both at a p-value of 0.05 or lower.
