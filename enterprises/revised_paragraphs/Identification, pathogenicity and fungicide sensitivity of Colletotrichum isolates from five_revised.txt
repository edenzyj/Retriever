Abstract
Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an economically important woody nut and edible oil tree worldwide. However, walnut production is limited by walnut anthracnose, a devastating disease that causes significant yield losses. Studying the etiology of anthracnose on walnut and the pathogens' virulence and sensitivities to fungicides is beneficial for effective control. This study aimed to identify the pathogen of walnut anthracnose and reveal the population diversity of pathogens through virulence, sensitivities to fungicides, and genetic variation. A total of 13 single-spore Colletotrichum isolates were collected from walnut anthracnose-diseased fruits and leaves from 13 walnut commercial orchards in Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces in China. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) based on multilocus phylogenetic analyses (internal transcribed spacer, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase), morphological and cultural characteristics, and pathogenicity. When the same walnut tissue was inoculated with different isolates, the disease lesion sizes varied. The results showed that the virulence of all isolates was significantly different, with no correlation to geographic origins. Virulence to walnut leaves and fruits inoculated with the same isolate was also significantly different. Based on virulence to walnut leaves and fruits, the 13 isolates were divided into three groups. Virulence of 69.2% of the isolates to walnut fruits was higher than that to leaves; 15.4% of isolates showed no difference in pathogenicity, while 15.4% had higher virulence to walnut leaves. Tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim inhibited the growth of fungal mycelia, with the concentrations for 50% maximal effect (EC50) values ranging from 0.4 to 20.5, 0.6 to 2.6, 0.2 to 1.6, and 0.002 to 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, with average values of 6.5 ± 6.9, 1.5 ± 0.6, 0.9 ± 0.4, and 0.1 ± 0.05 mg/ml. All isolates were more sensitive to difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim than to tebuconazole (P < 0.01). Sensitivities to the same fungicide varied among isolates. Isolates SL-31 and TS-09 were the least sensitive to carbendazim and tebuconazole, respectively, with resistance ratios of 87.3 and 51.6. Sensitivities to difenoconazole and flusilazole were largely consistent among all isola
Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an important woody nut and edible oil tree worldwide. Walnut trees are primarily cultivated for their nuts, which are mainly used for food and oil production. However, walnut production is threatened by several insects and diseases. Among these, anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a significant constraint to walnut production in many growing regions, often resulting in substantial yield losses and, in some orchards, complete losses. In Shandong Province, China, walnut anthracnose occurs from late June to harvest. The lesions typically measure about 5 to 10 mm in diameter by mid to late July. By mid-August, some spots merge into larger necrotic areas, leading to abnormal development or premature dropping of fruits and leaves. Fruits and leaves infected in August can shed extensively before harvest (late August to early September).
The genus Colletotrichum is one of the most destructive plant pathogens globally. Scientifically and economically, it is regarded as the eighth most important group of phytopathogenic fungi, capable of attacking over 3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants, including various cereals, fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals. Several Colletotrichum species have been isolated from J. regia, such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato in Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa; Colletotrichum sp. in Mexico; and C. gloeosporioides from walnut fruits in Slovenia, which causes spots on green walnut fruits. Other species include Colletotrichum godetiae and Colletotrichum acutatum in Australia, as well as an unidentified C. acutatum sensu lato with unknown geographic origin and pathogenicity. In France, Colletotrichum fioriniae, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides sensu lato were isolated from walnut leaves, nuts, and buds and were confirmed as pathogens of walnut anthracnose through multigene phylogenetic analysis. In Brazil, C. nymphaeae caused walnut anthracnose. In China, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, Colletotrichum siamense, Colletotrichum fructicola, and Colletotrichum viniferum have all been isolated from walnuts. The pathogens responsible for walnut anthracnose include not only C. gloeosporioides but also C. fructicola and C. siamense.
C. fioriniae could infect walnut leaves, and the symptoms were similar to anthracnose. C. viniferum only infected walnut leaves, and the symptoms were not typical. There was a difference in pathogenicity among Colletotrichum isolates. Researchers considered that the pathogenicity of the genus Colletotrichum from different sources to the same litchi cultivar varied. The virulence of C. siamense to walnut fruits was not consistent with that to leaves. Chemical control methods are the most commonly used strategies against anthracnose. Reports indicated that C. gloeosporioides causing grape ripe rot was resistant to thiophanate-methyl and diethofencarb. Isolates of C. gloeosporioides from mango, litchi, and longan in Hainan province exhibited high resistance to carbendazim. However, differences in fungicide sensitivities of isolates causing walnut anthracnose remain unknown. There is considerable interspecies and intraspecific diversity within these populations. The genetic diversity of grape anthracnose pathogens in Yunnan province was complex and did not correlate with geographic origins, host specificities, colony or spore morphologies, or pathogenicity to red globe grape. The diversity of populations of the isolates causing anthracnose in tea and other woody plants in Fujian province aligned with host specificities rather than geographic origins. The genetic differences of walnut anthracnose pathogens are largely unknown.
The objectives of this study were (i) to identify the species of the genus Colletotrichum causing walnut anthracnose using multilocus phylogenetic analyses and morphological characteristics, (ii) to determine the pathogenicity of the isolates obtained from walnut fruits and leaves in China, and (iii) to examine the sensitivity of isolates to four fungicides (tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim) using in vitro methods.
From 2013 to 2014, walnut fruits and leaves with anthracnose symptoms were collected from 13 walnut orchards in Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Shandong provinces in China. Pure cultures were obtained from diseased walnut fruits and leaves as well as from single-spore isolation. The walnut fruits and leaves were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, and the margins of the healthy and diseased tissues were cut into 3- to 4-mm² segments. The segments were sterilized with 1% NaOCl for 60 seconds and 70% ethanol for 60 seconds, and they were washed in sterile distilled water three times. Five segments were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA; 1.5%) and incubated at 28°C. Seven days later, hyphae were transplanted to PDA plates for sporulation. Using serial dilution, monosporic isolates were obtained and stored at 4°C on PDA slants. Most of the isolates were stored and preserved in the China Forestry Culture Collection Center.
The isolates were cultured on PDA at 28°C for 5 days. The colony color, conidial masses, and zonation were observed and documented. A drop of sterile water was placed on a glass slide, and then three acervuli were placed on the slide and gently crushed under a cover glass; a few drops of cedar oil were added under the cover glass to decrease water evaporation. Appressoria developed on the surfac
DNA extraction, amplification, sequencing, and phylogenetic analyses were conducted on mycelia that had been growing for 5 days on PDA. The mycelia were dried with sterile filter paper and collected in a sterile centrifuge tube. Mycelial powder was obtained using the trituration method in liquid nitrogen.
The walnut anthracnose sample geographic distribution, walnut varieties, and damage degree are as follows:
The samples were identified by their isolate numbers, orchard locations, geographic coordinates, walnut varieties, damage degrees, and the type of disease sample. The data revealed a range of damage levels across different locations and varieties, with some samples showing severe incidences.
The mycelial powder was dissolved in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer, which consisted of 2% (wt/vol) CTAB, 1.42 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), and 0.2% (wt/vol) β-mercaptoethanol, and incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes. Genomic DNAs of all isolates were extracted following the method described by Freeman et al. (1996). PCR amplifications were conducted with the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) genes. Four loci were amplified: the ribosomal DNA region using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 for ITS, the GAPDH gene using primers GDF-1 and GDR1, the CHS-1 gene using primers CHS-79F and CHS-354R, and the ACT gene using primers ACT-512F and ACT-783R.
The PCR reaction system consisted of a total volume of 25 μl, mixed with Taq DNA polymerase mix (12.5 μl), primer-F (1.0 μl), primer-R (1.0 μl), genomic DNA (2.0 μl), and ddH2O (8.5 μl). The PCR amplification procedure included 36 cycles. Information about initial denaturation, denaturation, annealing, extension, and final extension was documented. After PCR, all amplification products were sequenced by Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. All sequences were deposited in GenBank. The ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences were
The sequences of 46 Colletotrichum isolates were downloaded from GenBank, and Colletotrichum boninense MAFF 305972 was used as an outgroup. This isolate was an ex-holotype culture obtained from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum. The sequences of each locus were aligned for analysis.
The study utilized various strains of the genus Colletotrichum, detailing their characteristics in a table. The species, culture accession numbers, host plants, countries of origin, and corresponding GenBank accession numbers for the loci ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 were included. For example, Colletotrichum aenigmay (ICMP 18608) was sourced from Persea americana in Israel, while Colletotrichum gloeosporioides had multiple isolates from different hosts and countries, such as Citrus sinensis from Italy and Juglans regia from China. The table highlights the diversity of isolates used in the study, with each strain's details contributing to the overall understanding of the genus. Ex-type strains or authentic cultures are indicated in bold, while strains collected in this study are marked accordingly.
Using MEGA 7.0, the gaps were considered as missing data, and the alignments were adjusted manually for maximum alignment and maximum sequence similarity. Four genes per region were concatenated in the order of “ITS-GAPDH-ACT-CHS-1” using Fasta alignment joiner software. Phylogenetic analyses were performed with the concatenated sequence dataset using MEGA 7.0 software (Kumar et al. 2016), and two multilocus phylogenetic trees were generated using the neighbor-joining method or maximum parsimony method. The phylogenetic trees were drawn to scale, and the optimal tree with the sum of branch length was measured according to the number of substitutions per site to evaluate the relative stability of the branches.
Pathogenicity experiments were conducted at the experimental station of the Research Center for the Prevention and Control of Invasive Forest Pests of Shandong Province. Healthy fruits (cultivar Xiangling, 1 month old) and leaves (fully expanded) were inoculated in vitro with plugs (⌀ = 5 mm) of isolates cultured for 5 days. Thirteen isolates were used. In total, 280 fruits and 168 leaves were rinsed with running tap water for 60 seconds, surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, and rinsed with sterile distilled water three times. All of the fruits and leaves were punctured with a red-hot needle (⌀ = 0.5 mm) on the surface. The leaves were inoculated with two hyphal plugs, and the fruits were inoculated with one hyphal plug; the needle-wounded leaves and fruits were inoculated with blank agar plugs as a control. Each isolate was inoculated to 20 fruits and 12 leaves; an additional 20 fruits and 12 leaves were treated with blank agar plugs as controls. All treatments and controls were placed into sterile tissue culture bottles (⌀ = 92 mm, h = 274 mm, v = 690 ml) containing two layers of wet paper towels to keep them moist at 28°C under a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Anthracnose symptoms were evaluated on the seventh day after inoculation. The fungus was reisolated from symptomatic lesions using the aforementioned method.
The table provided details various species of Colletotrichum along with their culture accession numbers, host plants, countries of origin, and GenBank accession numbers for four genes (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1). Notably, several isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides were collected from Juglans regia in China, with their respective accession numbers listed. Other species such as Colletotrichum grevilleae and Colletotrichum grossum are also included, showing a diversity of hosts and geographic origins.

Results
Description of symptoms in the field. In major walnut production areas, walnut anthracnose disease primarily affected leaves and fruits. When leaves were infected, the spots were nearly round or irregular, water-soaked, and ranged from brown to dark brown. The spots expanded along the veins, forming long strip lesions. In later stages, older lesions became necrotic and perforated, leading to early defoliation. When fruits were infected, sub-circular or irregular spots appeared initially. These spots were water-soaked, sunken, and brown to black. Some spots enlarged and merged into large necrotic areas. Within these necrotic areas, acervuli formed in concentric rings and oozed gelatinous pink conidial masses. In severe cases, multiple spots merged and spread over the entire fruit, with the pathogen reaching the immature endocarp (nut shell). The fruits failed to develop normally; most dropped prematurely, and the kernels (nutmeat) were inedible. The severity of walnut pericarp damage was closely associated with the condition of walnut kernels. Initially, the spots were confined to the walnut pericarp without affecting the kernels, so the quality of the walnut kernels remained unaffected by walnut anthracnose. However, once the walnut pericarp spot area reached one-fourth of the whole fruit, the kernels became infected, leading to visible spots on the kernels. At this stage, both the quality and quantity of the kernels were compromised.
Isolate collection. The incidence varied across the 13 orchards, with the highest incidence found in orchards 2 and 3, where the walnut variety was Xiangling. A total of 59 isolates were obtained from diseased fruits and leaves. In orchard 7, genera Colletotrichum and Fusarium were isolated. The genera Colletotrichum and Alternaria were identified in orchards 4, 6, and 8, while Colletotrichum and Xanthomonas were isolated from orchards 10 and 11. One Colletotrichum isolate was chosen to represent each orchard, and 13 isolates were preserved.
Morphological characteristics. On potato dextrose agar (PDA), the aerial mycelium was dense and cottony; colonies appeared milky, pale gray to medium gray towards the center, and gray to olivaceous gray at the center with sporadic dark gray flecks on the edges. Colonies had an entire margin, with orange conidial masses visible in acervuli. Sexual morph was absent, while asexual morph was present on PDA. Hyphae were hyaline to medium brown, smooth, septate, and branched. Acervuli were observed. Setae were not detected. Conidiophores were hyaline, smooth-walled, and occasionally branched. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth, and cylindrical, often featuring a septum.
Conidia were straight and mostly cylindrical with broadly rounded ends that were sometimes slightly and gradually acute to the end. The size ranged from 14.8 to 19.5 µm in length and from 4.3 to 6.1 µm in width, with an average of 16.9 ± 1.0 × 5.2 ± 0.4 µm (n = 51), resulting in a length-to-width ratio (L/W) of 3.3. Appressoria were simple or in small groups, subglobose or ellipsoid, and rarely irregular. The size ranged from 5.2 to 8.9 µm in length and from 2.7 to 7.1 µm in width, with an average of 7.2 ± 1.1 × 5.4 ± 1.0 µm (n = 26), yielding an L/W ratio of 1.3. Consequently, the isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
Using the Blast option in the Q-Bank, all ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences were compared with the sequences of known species. Compared with the sequences of C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto isolates ICMP 17821 and ICMP 12939, the similarity of ITS sequences ranged from 99.3% to 100%; the CHS-1 sequences of all isolates showed 99.2% to 100% similarity. The similarity of GAPDH sequences ranged from 89.9% to 98.6%, and the ACT sequences of isolates SL-30, LZ-02, SQ-141, ZZ-27, YT-172, SL-31, HB-49, SL-37, SL-34, SMX-42H, and ZQ-29 exhibited 100% and 99.6% similarity with C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates ICMP 17821 and ICMP 12939, respectively. To compare with the sequences of 46 isolates downloaded from GenBank, ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences of all isolates were concatenated using the Fasta alignment joiner software. The aligned sequence was 98.0% to 99.5% homologous to ex-type C. gloeosporioides s.s. ICMP 17821. The multilocus phylogenetic trees were generated using neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods. There were a total of 1,061 sites in the final dataset, with 715 conserved sites, 312 variable sites, 163 parsimony informative sites, and 140 singleton sites. In the maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree, the tree length was 465, the consistency index was 0.56, and the retention index was 0.84. The composite indices were 0.57 for all sites and 0.47 for parsimony informative sites. The isolates tested clustered with C. gloeosporioides s.s. with 98% bootstrap support. In the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, the sum of the branch length was 0.57. All 13 isolates studied were clustered with C. gloeosporioides s.s., including its ex-type, with 100% bootstrap support. The multilocus phylo
Tode was the first to observe the genus Colletotrichum in 1790, and Corda legitimately described it in 1831. Since 2009, Cai et al. have proposed a systematics approach for Colletotrichum based on multigene phylogeny, comparing the isolates under study with type specimens. A clearly defined phylogenetic lineage should be combined with decipherable polyphasic characters, including morphology, physiology, pathogenicity, cultural characteristics, and secondary metabolites. The taxonomy of the genus Colletotrichum has undergone significant changes and numerous revisions, resulting in the addition, typification, and synonymy of many species. Some new species have been introduced, some species have been segregated, and others have been abolished. As of 2019, there are 213 accepted species in the genus Colletotrichum. Most members of this genus are important plant pathogens. Colletotrichum spp. may cause walnut anthracnose. Before 2015, the pathogen was identified as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological characters or ITS data analysis in China. C. gloeosporioides is a species complex that includes 38 closely related species. These reports often failed to determine the specific species to which the pathogens belonged within C. gloeosporioides s.l. Subtle differences in colony morphology exist among the sibling species, while the colonies of different isolates of the same species can be morphologically distinct. Different Colletotrichum species may infect the same host, and the same species could infect different hosts. Several mycologists who worked on Colletotrichum taxonomy have opined that the taxonomic system based on morphological characteristics, host range, and ITS data is confusing, leading to problematic identification results. Proper identification of the pathogen is crucial for developing effective management strategies, making it essential to accurately distinguish the species from one another. In this study, we confirmed that C. gloeosporioides s.s. is one of the species of the genus Colletotrichum responsible for walnut anthracnose in China, using multigene phylogeny, morphological characters, and cultural properties. Several Colletotrichum species associated with walnut anthracnose include C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. fioriniae, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides s.l. It is safe to say that walnut anthracnose is a complex disease. With an increasing number of walnut anthracnose samples collected from various walnut orchards across wider geographic areas in China, it is likely that
The resistance ratio of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto isolates to four fungicides—carbendazim, flusilazole, difenoconazole, and tebuconazole—was analyzed. The primers used in this study, including their sequences, amplicon sizes, sources, and PCR conditions, are detailed as follows:
For the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, the primer ITS1 (5¢-TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG-3¢) produces a 500 bp amplicon, with an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes, denaturation at 94°C for 0.5 minutes, annealing at 58°C for 0.5 minutes, extension at 72°C for 1.5 minutes, and a final extension at 72°C for 7 minutes. The primer ITS4 (5¢-TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC-3¢) complements this.
For the actin gene, the forward primer ACT-512F (5¢-ATGTGCAAGGCCGGTTTCGC-3¢) and the reverse primer ACT-783R (5¢-TACGAGTCCTTCTGGCCCAT-3¢) yield a 300 bp product, using similar PCR conditions with an annealing temperature of 59°C.
The glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene utilizes forward primer GDF-1 (5¢-GCCGTCAACGACCCCTTCATTGA-3¢) and reverse primer GDR1 (5¢-GGGTGGAGTCGTACTTGAGCATGT-3¢) to produce a 300 bp amplicon with an annealing temperature of 56°C.
For the chitin synthase (CHS-1) gene, forward primer CHSI-79F (5¢-TGGGGCAAGGATGCTTGGAAGAAG-3¢) and reverse primer CHSI-354R (5¢-TGGAAGAACCATCTGTGAGAGTTG-3¢) also yield a 300 bp product with an annealing temperature of 56°C.
Further studies are necessary to clarify the infection time, the independent or collaborative infection of walnut, and the disease occurrence patterns of C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. gloeosporioides s.s. Notably, there was significant variability in virulence among isolates of the same species (C. siamense, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae) that caused walnut anthracnose. This paper observed varying virulence among isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. when inoculated on walnut leaves or fruits. The virulence of C. siamense isolates towards walnut fruits was consistent, while C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates exhibited significant differences.
Even among isolates from the same geographic origin, virulence towards walnut leaves or fruits showed substantial variability, suggesting that virulence differences were not correlated with geographic origins. Compared to leaves, both *C. glo
For controlling walnut anthracnose, the main management strategy was to rely mainly on the timely application of fungicides. We determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim, in this paper. Although the number of isolates was relatively restricted, the results still showed differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL 31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37 were from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, with resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole were extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the differences in sensitivities were likely consistent with the frequency of carbendazim or tebuconazole usage locally. The sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Meanwhile, our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. displayed differential sensitivities to carbendazim. The results reflected the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To increase the control effect, it is important for practitioners to ascertain the isolate sensitivities to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, the efficacies need to be verified with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, it is imperative to accurately identify the pathogen. Additionally, it is necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates of the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and fungicides with different mechanisms should be used in rotation. In conclusion, the 13 isolates from the orchards were confirmed to be C. gloeosporioides s.s., all recognized as pathogens of walnut anthracnose in China. The isolates from different geographic regions showed differences in virulence and fungicide sensitivities. The results preliminarily indicated a high intraspecific diversity among the populations of C. gloeosporioides s.s. This study provided crucial information for managing this disease in China.
