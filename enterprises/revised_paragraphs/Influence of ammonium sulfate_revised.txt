Influence of Ammonium Sulfate and Rotation Crops on Strawberry Black Root Rot
Black root rot is a complex root disease of strawberry (Fragaria x ananassa Duchesne) that causes root death and reduces plant vigor, productivity, and winter survival. Although many organisms are implicated in black root rot, surveys in Connecticut and elsewhere found that a binucleate Rhizoctonia sp. (R. fragariae Hussain and McKeen) in anastomosis groups AG-A, AG-G, and AG-I; lesion nematodes (Pratylenchus penetrans (Cobb) Filip. & Shur. Stek); or both were consistently associated with the disease. Other minor fungi, such as Pythium, Iridella, Fusarium, and Cylindrocarpon spp., and certain rapidly growing gram-negative rod bacteria, have also been implicated in strawberry black root rot. Affected plants typically exhibit stunting and necrotic centers. Leaves are smaller, and the number of runners is reduced. Affected roots can have blackened lesions that extend into the cortical tissue, leaving the stele white for a period. Lesions coalesce to blacken the entire root. Cultivars that are resistant to black root rot are not available. Pre-plant fumigation may suppress black root rot in the year of planting, but typically does not offer any lasting control. Current control recommendations are to avoid abiotic stresses, such as drought, winter injury, and heavy wet soils, and to use a two-year rotation with grains. In New England, straw is used as a winter mulch for strawberries, so rotation with grains has been readily adopted by many growers to produce straw. However, rotation crops can vary in their susceptibility as hosts to R. fragariae and P. penetrans. Past research has demonstrated that ‘Saia’ oats (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and ‘Triple S’ sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense) were poor hosts of R. fragariae and P. penetrans, whereas ‘Garry’ oats (Avena sativa L.), rye (Secale cereale L.), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), canola (Brassica napus L.), or strawberries either increased or did not affect the population densities of the pathogens. Furthermore, research has found that strawberry black root rot was increased following particular rotation crops and was associated with elevated levels of fluorescing and nonfluorescing gram-negative rod bacteria in the rhizosphere of strawberry. Another control method for suppressing black root rot may be thr
In July 1995, 48 microplots consisting of polyvinyl chloride tubes (15 cm in diameter and 0.46 m long) were set 0.3 m deep in Windsor, Connecticut, and filled with soil (Watchaug fine sandy loam, pH 5.9) that previously had been planted with strawberries, where symptoms of black root rot had been severe. Twelve microplots were seeded with 10 to 15 seeds of oat cultivars Garry or Saia or sorgho-sudangrass. Twelve microplots were planted with 1-year-old ‘Honeoye’ strawberry crowns (one per microplot) to serve as controls. Of the 12 microplots that were seeded with the grasses, 6 were fertilized with ammonium sulfate at 50 kg of nitrogen per hectare (0.06 g of nitrogen per microplot), and the other 6 were fertilized with calcium nitrate at 50 kg of nitrogen per hectare. Microplots planted with strawberries received calcium nitrate or ammonium sulfate at 112 kg of nitrogen per hectare (0.14 g of nitrogen per microplot).
The combined effects of rotation crops and nitrogen fertilizers were examined on the strawberry black root rot disease complex. Microplots were filled with soil that had a history of strawberry black root rot and seeded with two types of oats (Avena strigosa ‘Saia oats’ or A. sativa ‘Garry oats’) or with sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor × S. sudanense ‘Triple S’). In May 1996, the crops were chopped and incorporated into the soil. The soil was replanted with 1-year-old strawberry ‘Honeoye’ crowns and then fertilized with ammonium sulfate or calcium nitrate at equivalent rates of nitrogen. Two months later, the ammonium sulfate-treated plants had 36% more leaf area and 41% more runners than strawberries treated with calcium nitrate. Strawberries that had been precropped with ‘Saia’ oats had 135% more runners and 38% more early fruit yield than strawberries grown in control microplots. Total fruit yield was not affected by the treatments. Compared to calcium nitrate, the ammonium sulfate treatment reduced the percentage of blackened roots. The influence of the cover crops on growth and disease was stronger with ammonium sulfate fertilization than with calcium nitrate fertilization.
Combining ‘Saia’ oats or sorgho-sudangrass rotation with ammonium sulfate fertilization reduced lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) numbers in subsequent strawberry roots when compared to controls. Additionally, the combination of ‘Saia’ or ‘Garry’ oats as a precrop with applications of ammonium sulfate reduced black root rot severity compared to controls. Only the ‘Garry’ oat rotation reduced strawberry root colonization by Rhizoctonia fragariae when compared to controls. Other effects were associated with using ammonium sulfate. The ammonium sulfate treatment lowered the rhizosphere soil pH by 0.2 units, reduced the numbers of fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere by 10- to 15-fold, and produced leaves that had more nitrogen, potassium, sulfur, manganese, and zinc content than plants treated with calcium nitrate. Rotation with ‘Saia’ oats combined with ammonium sulfate fertilizat
Ca, Mg, and S were applied to each plot at 45, 45, 30, and 45 kg/ha, respectively. Fertilizers were dissolved in 50 ml of water and poured on top of the soil. Therefore, eight treatments (three cover crops plus the control × two nitrogen fertilizers) were applied to 48 microplots in a complete randomized blocked factorial design (two blocks; three replicates per block). The experiment was repeated in Hamden, Connecticut, one week later. In May 1996, cover crop residues or surviving strawberry crowns were chopped and incorporated into the soil with trowels. Each plot was then planted with one 1-year-old ‘Honeoye’ strawberry crown. Microplots that had been treated with Ca(NO3)2 or (NH4)2SO4 in 1995 continued to receive the same nitrogen fertilizer in 1996. Each microplot received 85 kg of N/ha (0.01 g of N/microplot) at planting and 85 kg of N/ha in July 1996. All microplots received K, P, Ca, and S at total seasonal equivalents of 84, 84, 30, and 45 kg/ha, respectively. In May 1997, at 10% bloom, microplots received 10% of the total 1996 fertilizer rate. A total of 60% was applied at renovation on 25 July, and the remaining 30% was applied on 9 September.
In 1996, the treatment effects on black root rot and plant health were measured by counting the runners, which were removed weekly in June and July, and by measuring leaf area (A) in late June and late July. Leaf area was determined by the equation: A = 3.02 + 1.77 L × W (R² = 0.98), in which L and W are the length and width, respectively, of the middle leaflet of each strawberry leaf. This equation was generated by regressing the products of the lengths and widths from 84 ‘Honeoye’ strawberry leaves against their leaf areas, which were determined on a leaf area meter. In June 1997, berries were picked, counted, and weighed for a total of eight harvest dates. Early fruit harvests are more economically important than later pickings, so early yield was measured and defined as the total harvest from the first four pickings. Runners were not removed during the 1997 growing season, which is conventional for strawberry culture.
In September 1997, the microplots were removed from the surrounding soil, and the plant with its roots and soil were taken from each microplot. Loose soil was gently dislodged from the roots, after which the roots were vigorously shaken into plastic bags to sample the rhizosphere soil. The soil was immediately stored on ice until it could be refrigerated at 4°C. Plant tops and roots were separated just below the junction where the petioles attach to the crown. The roots and plant tops were washed in tap water to remove soil, blotted dry between absorbent paper towels, and weighed. The foliar portions were oven-dried and weighed. Root systems were rated for black root rot by estimating the percentage of blackened roots. Roots were sampled for isolation of the pathogens. From each root system, 1-cm sections were cut from two young structural roots that emerged from the crown (crown roots), two blackened perennial roots that were devoid of feeder roots (main perennial roots), and two feeder roots. Root sections were washed in tap water, rinsed with distilled water, and placed on water agar. Plates were incubated for 5 days at room temperature and microscopically examined (200× magni
Rhizosphere soil was serially diluted into sterile normal saline blanks. Aliquots (0.1 ml) of each dilution were spread onto 10% tryptic-soy agar plus 13.5 g/liter agar in 10 cm-diameter petri plates to enumerate aerobic heterotrophic bacteria, King’s B agar for fluorescent pseudomonads, and Mn-dioxide agar for Mn-reducing bacteria. Three plates of each medium per dilution were prepared and incubated in the dark for 2 to 3 days at 25°C. Soil moisture was determined independently. For total bacteria, 10% tryptic-soy agar plates containing between 30 and 300 colonies were counted, averaged over the three plates, and expressed as log colonies of bacteria per gram of soil (oven dry weight equivalent). Fluorescent pseudomonads were enumerated by viewing King’s B agar under shortwave UV light 2 days later. Mn-reducing bacteria were detected 2 weeks later on Mn-dioxide agar by the zones of clearing that appeared around the colony. Fluorescent pseudomonads and Mn-reducers were expressed as log densities per gram of soil (oven dry weight equivalent).
Tissue analyses were conducted on leaf samples collected in 1996, which were dried to constant weights at 50°C and ground to powder in a mortar with a pestle. Dried tissue (1 g) from three replicate plants in one block were bulked, and 1 g of dried tissue from three plants in the other block were also bulked. Dried tissue (0.5 g) from these two bulked samples was digested with 5 ml of HCl and 10 ml of HNO3 in a microwave. Samples were brought up to 50 ml with deionized water. The elements K, P, Ca, Mg, S, Fe, Mn, Zn, Cu, and B were quantified by plasma spectrophotometry and expressed as µmol/g dry weight. Nitrogen was determined using the Kjeldahl procedure. Leaf tissue (0.25 g) from the two bulked samples was heated and digested in 4 ml of H2SO4 and 10 ml of H2O2, then analyzed colorimetrically for total N. Values were averaged and presented as µmol/g dry weight.
Statistical procedures involved analyzing data using analysis of variance for a blocked factorial design. Since there were no significant interactions between the treatments and the Hamden site or with the Windsor site at P = 0.05, values from both sites were combined for analysis and presentation. Mean separation was done using the Student-Newman-Keuls Test at P = 0.05.
Differences in leaf area were found in July 1996, but not in June. Plants fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 had 36% more leaf area and 41% more runners than plants treated with Ca(NO
Plant Disease / February 1999 121 compared to other treatments (P = 0.01). There were also fewer blackened roots on plants treated with (NH4)2SO4 when compared to Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.01). Rhizoctonia spp. were isolated from the strawberry roots 68% of the time, whereas Fusarium and Pythium spp. were detected only 7.4% and 0.8% of the time, respectively (data not shown). Of the three classes of roots, the perennial main roots were most colonized by Rhizoctonia spp., followed by feeder roots and then crown roots. Plants pre-cropped with ‘Garry’ oats had less colonization of feeder roots and main perennial roots by Rhizoctonia spp. than roots from the control treatment (P = 0.05). The roots of strawberries that were pre-cropped with Saia oats or with sorgho sudangrass and then treated with (NH4)2SO4 had 66% or 51% fewer nematodes, respectively, than controls treated with (NH4)2SO4 (P = 0.001). Lesion nematode numbers did not differ between strawberries that were pre-cropped with Garry oats and control strawberries. Lesion nematodes were recovered in greater densities from roots treated with (NH4)2SO4 than with Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.001). The rhizosphere pH in soil treated with (NH4)2SO4 was 4.81, compared to 5.08 for Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.001), but there were no differences between the cover crops. The rhizosphere soil of (NH4)2SO4 treated plants had a 10- to 15-fold reduction in the number of fluorescent pseudomonads when compared to Ca(NO3)2 treated rhizosphere soil (P < 0.001). Total heterotrophic bacteria and Mn-reducing microbes were not affected by the treatments. The mineral composition of the strawberry leaves sampled in September 1996 did not significantly differ between the two sites except for the elements N, K, Mg, and S, which were in greater concentration in Windsor than in Hamden. Since there were no interactions between site and treatments, values from both sites were combined for analysis and presentation. Leaf concentrations of N, K, S, and Zn in plants treated with (NH4)2SO4 were significantly increased by 7% to 30%, while Mn levels were significantly increased by 103% compared to those fertilized with Ca(NO3)2. Sorgho-sudangrass and both oat species increased the leaf concentration of Ca and Mg when compared to control plants.
The growth and yield components of strawberry plants grown in microplots infested with black root rot pathogens were evaluated after being pre-cropped with various cover crops and fertilized with either ammonium sulfate or calcium nitrate. The data showed that strawberry plants following Garry oats yielded an average of 404 g/plant in total berry yield, while those following Saia oats reached 746 g/plant, which was significantly higher. In contrast, the strawberry plants fertilized with calcium nitrate exhibited lower yields, with total berry yield averaging 433 g/plant. The fresh root weights and dry foliar weights also varied among the different cover crops, with Saia oats consistently showing higher values. The mean values across treatments indicated that those fertilized with ammonium sulfate had better growth parameters compared to those receiving calcium nitrate.
The study indicated that the use of cover crops can significantly affect the health of strawberry plants by influencing pathogen dynamics. Saia oats specifically reduced root lesion nematodes and increased early berry yield, while Garry oats affected root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. but did not improve yield. This discrepancy may stem from the susceptibility of Garry oats to lesion nematodes, a key pathogen in these soils. The resistance of Saia oats to the lesion nematode has been noted in previous research, highlighting its potential benefits in crop rotation strategies. Moreover, while sorgho-sudangrass reduced nematode populations, it did not demonstrate a corresponding effect on disease severity or yield, suggesting that nematode density alone may not dictate plant health outcomes. Further investigation into the interactions between cover crop residues and soil microbiota may shed light on the complex relationships influencing plant diseases and crop productivity.
The association of Rhizoctonia spp. with strawberry roots ranges from mycorrhizal relationships to pathogenic interactions. Past studies using the same soil type found that nearly all isolates of Rhizoctonia from strawberry roots belonged to the virulent anastomosis groups AG-A, AG-G, and AG-I of binucleate R. fragariae. The very low frequency of isolating Pythium or Fusarium spp. suggests that, in these soils, they were not significant contributors to the black root rot complex. Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 resulted in greater disease suppression and increased plant growth compared to Ca(NO3)2, although yield was not affected. Previous studies have shown that (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot and increased yield in strawberries and suppressed root diseases in other crops. Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 did not influence the recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. from roots but did increase root weight and the number of lesion nematodes. Since P. penetrans is an obligate parasite and requires living roots, it is reasonable to find lower densities of this pathogen on the roots of dead and declining strawberries, as observed in the Ca(NO3)2-treated plants, compared to the healthier (NH4)2SO4-treated plants. An increase in mineral composition in (NH4)2SO4-treated plants versus Ca(NO3)2-treated plants has been previously noted.
The rhizosphere pH, total bacteria, fluorescent pseudomonads, and Mn-reducing bacteria associated with strawberry roots were assessed in microplots infested with black root rot pathogens, pre-cropped with different cover crops, and fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 or Ca(NO3)2. The average rhizosphere pH ranged from 4.72 to 5.22, with total bacterial counts varying across treatments. Fluorescent pseudomonads showed a mean count between 4.55 and 6.12, while Mn-reducing bacteria ranged from 3.19 to 3.87. Notably, the (NH4)2SO4 treatment generally resulted in lower pH values and higher total bacterial counts compared to the Ca(NO3)2 treatment, indicating a potential impact of fertilization on microbial communities in the rhizosphere.
Mineral composition of strawberry leaves was also analyzed, revealing significant differences in nutrient levels among the treatments. In the (NH4)2SO4 group, nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium levels were notably higher, with mean values of 1,285 µmol/g tissue for nitrogen. Calcium levels varied between treatments, with the highest values observed in the (NH4)2SO4 treatments for specific cover crops. Manganese content was particularly striking, suggesting a correlation with disease suppression. Manganese may play a role in enhancing host defense mechanisms, reducing pathogen virulence, and contributing to biological suppression of the pathogens. While it was hypothesized that the oat cultivars could increase the availability of Mn through microbial transformations, no detectable effect was observed among the rotation crops on Mn-reducing organisms. The acidification of the rhizosphere in (NH4)2SO4-treated plants likely contributed significantly to increased Mn availability. The exact role of Mn in diseas
Hildebrand and West found that diseased strawberry roots were associated with rapidly growing fluorescent and non-fluorescent gram-negative groups of bacteria. However, when black root rot was suppressed by rotation, they found that these bacterial groups were replaced by slow-growing bacteria. We found no effect of cover crops on microbial densities in the rhizosphere, but we observed that the fast-growing fluorescent pseudomonads were 10 to 15 times more abundant in the rhizosphere of the more diseased Ca(NO3)2-treated plants than in the rhizosphere of plants treated with (NH4)2SO4. The role of these bacteria in black root rot is unclear. Pseudomonads are common exploiters of the rhizosphere and root and can be associated with root damage. Future investigations should determine if these bacteria are involved with black root rot and how fertilization affects their proliferation in the rhizosphere.
