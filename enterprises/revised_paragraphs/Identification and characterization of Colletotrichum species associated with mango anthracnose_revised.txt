Abstract
Mango (Mangifera indica) is widely grown across southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Taiwan. Guangxi itself has over 86,667 hectares of mango production. The purpose of this study was to identify Colletotrichum species associated with mango in different parts of Guangxi and examine their pathogenicity on mango leaves and fruits in vitro. Diseased leaves were collected from 25 mango orchards in various areas of Guangxi province. Sixty-five isolates were obtained from mango leaves exhibiting anthracnose symptoms, and these were further characterized based on morphology and DNA sequencing. Twenty-nine isolates from different areas were selected for sequencing and analyses of the internal transcribed spacer region, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, partial actin, β-tubulin, and chitin synthase genomic regions. The most common fungal isolates were three species: Colletotrichum asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense. C. asianum was the most prevalent and widely distributed in Guangxi (51.7%), followed by C. fructicola (37.9%) and C. siamense (10.2%), both found in Tiandong, Tianyang, and Wuming counties. There was no evidence of geographical specialization among the different species. Pathogenicity assays demonstrated that all isolates were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruit (cultivar Tainong). No relationship was found between the origin of isolates and their virulence. This study represents the first description of C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense as causal agents of mango leaf anthracnose in Guangxi province, China.
Mango (Mangifera indica) is considered one of the most important tropical or subtropical fruit crops. In China, mango is primarily cultivated in southern and southwestern provinces. The planted area of mango reached almost 130,000 hectares, producing nearly 900,000 tons in 2012. Guangxi province is the largest mango-producing area in China, and the mango industry significantly contributes to the local economy. Anthracnose disease o
Photita et al. (2005) discussed factors such as conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are not sufficient to distinguish Colletotrichum species, as variations can occur for the same specimen when grown in the lab and under different conditions. Thus, molecular techniques are essential for separating Colletotrichum species and examining genetic variation within and between species and populations (Cai et al. 2009; Hyde et al. 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Recent studies on the systematics of Colletotrichum species have classified them into nine major clades, along with smaller clusters and isolated species, which likely represent species complexes (Cannon et al. 2012). The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA is frequently used to differentiate Colletotrichum species (Freeman et al. 2000), although this method is not always satisfactory (Cannon et al. 2012). Other markers, such as actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), have also been employed to resolve relationships among Colletotrichum species (Weir et al. 2012). Given the recent changes in the classification of Colletotrichum species and the lack of information regarding the identity and characteristics of isolates causing mango anthracnose in China, this study aimed to: (i) identify and characterize species of Colletotrichum associated with mango anthracnose in Guangxi, China, based on morphological and DNA sequence comparisons; (ii) examine the virulence of isolates from different parts of Guangxi province and assess geographical differences; and (iii) investigate the relationships among Colletotrichum spp. isolates from mango using sequences of ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and GAPDH.
Materials and Methods
Fungal isolation. Mango leaves showing symptoms of anthracnose were collected from production fields in six counties (Tiandong, Tianyang, Tianlin, Youjiang, Wuming, and Qinzhou) in Guangxi province, covering an area of 450 by 300 km. Small sections (3 × 3 mm) were cut from the margins of lesions, surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 15 seconds, and 0.1% (v/v) mercuric chloride for 45 seconds, followed by rinses in sterile water. The sections were plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25°C. Fungal growth was examined daily for up to 14 days. Isolates were subcultured onto fresh PDA and purified using single-spore culture techniques. The isolates were stored on PDA slants at 4°C.
Morphological characterization. Isolates were cultured on PDA plates at 25°C under continuous fluorescent light for 5 days. Plugs (6-mm diameter) from the margins of colonies were placed in the center of each 90-mm-diameter plate, with four replications. The colony color and culture diameters (measured in two perpendicular directions) were recorded after 3, 7, and 10 days at 25°C. These colony diameters were used to calculate the hyphal growth rate (m
DNA isolation, polymerase chain reaction (PCR), and sequencing were conducted. Isolates were cultured on PDA in Petri plates overlaid with cellophane for 7 days at 25°C. Mycelia were harvested with a flamed spatula, and genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted using the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method (Taylor et al. 1993). All strains in this study were subjected to analysis of the rDNA-ITS, partial GAPDH, partial ACT, partial TUB2, and partial CHS-1 genomic regions. PCR amplification of GAPDH was performed using the primers GDF1 and GDR1 (Templeton et al. 1992) and CHS-1 was amplified using CHS79F and CHS354R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). The partial ACT, TUB2, and ITS regions were amplified with the primer pairs ACT512F and ACT783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), T1 and Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990), respectively. All PCR reactions were conducted in 50-ml volumes containing 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM concentrations of each dNTP, 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM concentrations of each primer.
The primers used for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing include the following: for Actin, ACT-512F (ATGTGCAAGGCCGGTTTCGC) and ACT-783R (TACGAGTCCTTCTGGCCCAT) from Carbone and Kohn (1999); for GAPDH, GDF1 (GCCGTCAACGACCCCTTCATTGA) and GDR1 (GGGTGGAGTCGTACTTGAGCATGT) from Templeton et al. (1992); for CHS-1, CHS79F (TGGGGCAAGGATGCTTGGAAGAAG) and CHS354R (TGGAAGAACCATCTGTGAGAGTTG) from Carbone and Kohn (1999); for β-Tubulin, T1 (AACATGCGTGAGATTGTAAGT) from O’Donnell et al. (2000) and bt2b (ACCCTCAGTGTAGTGACCCTTGGC) from Glass and Donaldson (1995); for ITS, ITS1 (TCCGTAGGTGAACCTGCGG) and ITS4 (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) from White et al. (1990). GAPDH refers to glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, CHS-1 refers to chitin synthase, and ITS refers to the rDNA internal transcribed spacer region.
The phylogenetic study included various Colletotrichum isolates characterized by their species, culture type, host plant, country of origin, and GenBank accession numbers for the rDNA-ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CHS-1, and TUB2 genomic regions. The table outlines isolates such
C. theobromicola ICMP 18566 is associated with Olea europaea in Australia. The relevant genetic sequences are JX010282, JX009953, JX009496, JX009801, and JX010376. C. xanthorrhoeae BRIP 45094*, ICMP 17903, and CBS 127831 are linked to Xanthorrhoea preissii, also in Australia, with genetic sequences JX010261, JX009927, JX009478, JX009823, and JX010448. The collections mentioned include IMI (CABI Europe UK Centre, Egham, UK), ICMP (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plant, Landcare Research, Auckland, New Zealand), CBS (CBS-KNAW, Fungal Biodiversity Centre, Utrecht, Netherlands), UASB (University of Agricultural Sciences, Bangalore, India), and BRIP (Plant Pathology Herbarium, Department of Employment, Economic Development and Innovation, Queensland, Australia). The terms defined include ITS (rDNA internal transcribed spacer region), ACT (actin gene), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), CHS-1 (chitin synthase), TUB2 (β-tubulin), and * indicates ex-holotype or ex-epitype cultures.
The PCR reaction consisted of 0.5 units of Taq DNA polymerase (Takara) and 1 ml of template DNA (20 ng/ml). The PCR program for GAPDH, ACT, and TUB2 included a denaturation step at 94°C for 2 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 94°C for 45 seconds, 60°C for 45 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, concluding with a final cycle at 72°C for 10 minutes. The PCR program for the ITS region involved a 2-minute denaturation step at 94°C, followed by 34 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final 10-minute cycle at 72°C. Amplification products were purified and sequenced by Shanghai Sangon Company. Sequences from mango Colletotrichum isolates obtained from Guangxi were submitted to GenBank.
For phylogenetic analyses, sequences were edited and assembled using DNAMAN (version 5.2.2; Lynnon Biosoft) to produce consensus sequences, which were compared using BLAST against the NCBI non-redundant database. Sequences from ex-holotype or ex-epitype isolates of Colletotrichum species from GenBank were selected for the analyses. Sequence alignments of individual and combined genes were created with ClustalX version 1.83. Phylogenetic trees were constructed using MEGA4 software version 4.0, applying the maximum parsimony method.
Pathogenicity and virulence tests on detached mango fruits and leaves (cultivar Tainong) were conducted under controlled conditions using selected isolates. The isolates were incubated on PDA plates for 7 to 10 days at 25°C. Fresh young leaves and freshly harvested mango fruits, free from visible disease, were sourced from Tiandong, Guangxi, for inoculation. The leaves and fruits were washed with running water, surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 30
PDA cultures were placed on wound sites. Control treatments used sterile agar plugs. Inoculated fruits were placed in plastic containers (252 × 174 × 93 mm) overlaid with moist absorbent paper to maintain humidity. The containers were placed in unsealed bags and incubated at 25°C in the dark. Fruits were checked for the development of symptoms for up to 10 days. Isolates were considered pathogenic when lesions expanded beyond the initial wound site with a 5-mm diameter. Virulence was evaluated by measuring lesion length at 10 days post-inoculation (DPI) in two perpendicular directions. Significant differences in virulence were assessed by an analysis of variance, and when significant treatment effects were found, means were compared by LSD (P = 0.05) using Data Processing System software (DPS 3.0) for Windows (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China).
From 2011 to 2014, leaves of mango with anthracnose symptoms were collected from 25 mango orchards in Guangxi province, China. At least one isolate from each field was chosen for further analysis. In total, 65 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from different areas of Guangxi, and 29 single-spore isolates were selected for further study.
The study examined various isolates of Colletotrichum species from different geographical areas in Guangxi. The isolates included C. asianum and C. fructicola, with their corresponding GenBank accession numbers for several genomic regions, such as ACT, TUB2, GAPDH, CHS-1, and ITS. Each isolate's geographic area was also documented, providing a comprehensive overview of the fungal diversity in the region.
In the study, 1,285 isolates were used for further analysis, with one isolate selected from each orchard; however, in some larger orchards, more than one isolate was chosen. Among the 29 isolates, 15 were identified as C. asianum, 11 as C. fructicola, and 3 as C. siamense using morphological and molecular methods. Other species isolated, such as those from Alternaria, Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria, or Pestalotia, were not considered further.
Phylogenetic analyses involved selecting 29 isolates from different areas for sequencing and analyzing ITS, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, and CHS-1 genes. BLASTn searches of the generated DNA sequences from 15 isolates showed high similarity (>99%) with sequences of C. asianum, while 11 isolates were highly similar to sequences of C. fructicola, and 3 isolates had 99 or 100% similarity with C. siamense sequences. A phylogenetic tree was constructed using sequences from 29 Colletotrichum isolates from mango trees in Guangxi and extype or ex-epitype isolates in GenBank. This analysis used combined sequences from internal transcribed spacer, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, beta-tubulin, and chitin synthase 1 genes, with bootstrap values over 50% indicated at the nodes. Colletotrichum acutatum was used as the outgroup, and isolates from this study were emphasized in bold.
The ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS sequences of Colletotrichum from mango trees in Guangxi were submitted to GenBank and aligned with sequences from different hosts and countries. The gene boundaries in the alignment were as follows: ACT (282 to 289 bp), TUB2 (699 to 701 bp), CHS-1 (299 bp), GAPDH (277 to 280 bp), and ITS (546 bp). The phylogenetic analysis revealed three well-separated clades: one highly supported clade (99% bootstrap support) composed of 15 Colletotrichum isolates related to C. asianum isolates from Coffea arabica in Thailand and Mangifera indica in Australia; a second supported clade (69% bootstrap support) comprising 11 isolates related to C. fructicola; and a third clade (51% bootstrap support) comprising 3 isolates closely related to C. siamense. The diversity analysis indicated that 15 isolates (51.7%) belonged to C. asianum, 11 isolates (37.9%) to C. fructicola, and 3 isolates (10.2%) to C. siamense.
The average conidial sizes for isolates were C. asianum, 12.1 to 18.6 × 4.2 to 5.6 mm; C. fructicola, 14.1 to 20.2 × 3.7 to 4.3 mm; and C. siamense, 15.0 to 18.5 × 5.0 to 5.5 mm. The various Colletotrichum species reported here showed differences in conidial size and growth rates. All 29 tested isolates were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits. Ripened fruits with anthracnose developed sunken, dark brown to black decay. The virulence of the 29 isolates of Colletotrichum from Guangxi province showed significant differences, with lesion diameters ranging from 7.0 to 30.0 cm on leaves and from 6 to 21 mm on fruits. The lesion diameter of C. asianum on leaves ranged from 9.2 to 28.2 mm and on fruits from 6.2 to 21 mm. For C. fructicola, it was 8.8 to 30.0 mm on leaves and 5.8 to 13.6 mm on fruits. For C. siamense, it was 7.0 to 22.2 mm on leaves and 6.0 to 6.5 mm on fruits. The virulence of C. fructicola isolates TD1 and TD4 from the same field showed significant differences.
This is the first report characterizing Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of mango in Guangxi province, China, using morphological identification and phylogenetic analysis. The morphological features of the isolates agreed with the description of C. gloeosporioides, but cultural characteristics, which may be diverse due to cultural conditions, and conidial morphology cannot distinguish between species within the C. gloeosporioi
C. fructicola is diverse morphologically and geographically. The species has been found on coffee berries in Thailand, Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan, Limonium in Israel, Malus sp. and Fragaria × ananassa in the U.S.A., Persea americana in Australia, Ficus sp. in Germany, Malus sp. in Brazil, Dioscorea sp. in Nigeria, and Theobroma sp. and Tetragastris sp. in Panama (Weir et al. 2012), as well as Vitis sp. in China (Peng et al. 2013). C. fructicola has been described in association with mango in Brazil and Korea (Joa et al. 2016); however, this is the first report of C. fructicola infecting mango in China. C. ignotum is synonymous with C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), and our genetic analyses showed that the isolates from these two species were in one clade but divided into two subgroups. C. siamense has been associated with mango anthracnose in Colombia (Pardo-De la Hoz et al. 2016) and on mango fruit in Sanya, Hainan province, China (Qin et al. 2017). It has also been found in postharvest mango fruits from supermarkets in Changchun, northeast China (Liu et al. 2017). However, this species is not common on mango in Guangxi province, where only three isolates were identified as C. siamense. In this study, this species was not well separated from the C. gloeosporioides complex using the combined five genes, suggesting that additional genes may be needed for future studies.
Pathogenicity tests using three species of Colletotrichum isolates showed that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits in wound-inoculation studies. Symptoms may vary considerably based on factors such as variety, fruit conditions, humidity, temperature, and inoculum concentration (Freeman et al. 1998). Therefore, the observations from this study may not fully reflect the virulence potential. Additional research should be conducted to determine the virulence potential of Colletotrichum species under field conditions with natural inoculum rather than relying solely on in vitro artificial inoculation.
The Colletotrichum isolates from mango examined in this study showed diversity based on sequence analysis and morphological features. Higher genetic diversity is often correlated with higher evolutionary potential and with greater ability to adapt to changing environmental conditions. In addition, the sensitivity of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species from mango to carbendazim and thiabendazole are significantly different from each other in China. Such information can be used by pathologists and breeders to develop strategies and cultivars toward more effective management of mango anthracnose disease. Future studies should focus on surveys of more isolates and tests on other features such as fungicide sensitivity.
