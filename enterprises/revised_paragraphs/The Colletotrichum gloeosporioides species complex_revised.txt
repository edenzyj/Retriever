Abstract: The limit of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex is defined genetically, based on a strongly supported clade within the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree. All taxa accepted within this clade are morphologically more or less typical of the broadly defined C. gloeosporioides, as it has been applied in the literature for the past 50 years. We accept 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides complex. These include C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. psidii, C. siamense, C. theobromicola, C. tropicale, and C. xanthorrhoeae, along with the taxa described here as new: C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alatae, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, C. salsolae, and C. ti, plus the nom. nov. C. queenslandicum (for C. gloeosporioides var. minus). All of the taxa are defined genetically based on multi-gene phylogenies. Brief morphological descriptions are provided for species where no modern description is available. Many of the species are unable to be reliably distinguished using ITS, the official barcoding gene for fungi. Particularly problematic are a set of species genetically close to C. musae and another set genetically close to C. kahawae, referred to here as the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade, respectively. Each clade contains several species that are phylogenetically well supported in multi-gene analyses, but within the clades branch lengths are short because of the small number of phylogenetically informative characters, and in a few cases individual gene trees are incongruent.

INTRODUCTION
The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was first proposed by Penzig in 1882, based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, the type specimen of which was collected from Citrus in Italy. Much of the early literature used this name to refer to fungi associated with various diseases of Citrus, with other species established for morphologically similar fungi from different hosts. However, several early papers discussed the morphological similarity between many of the Colletotrichum species that had been described based on host preference and used inoculation tests to question whether or not the species were distinct. Some of these studies investigated the link between the various Colletotrichum species and their sexual Glomerella state in culture (e.g., Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia & Agati 1925). Authors such as Shear & Wood (1907, 1913) and Small (1926) concluded that many species described based on host preference were, in fact, the same, rejecting apparent differences in host preference as a basis for taxonomic segregation.
Small (1926) stated that the names Glomerella cingulata and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides should be used for the sexual and asexual morphs, respectively, of the many Colletotrichum species they regarded as conspecific. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was identified as the earliest name linked to what they considered a biologically diverse G. cingulata. The studies of von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970) formalized this concept taxonomically. The "von Arxian" taxonomic concept for Colletotrichum synonymized large numbers of species under the names C. graminicola (for grass-inhabiting species) and C. gloeosporioides (for non-grass inhabiting species with straight conidia). The genetic and biological diversity encompassed by these names was so broad that they became of little practical use to plant pathologists, conveying no information about pathogenicity, host range, or other attributes. The studies by von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957) were not based on direct examination of type material of all species, and some of the synonymy proposed in these papers has subsequently been found to be incorrect.
Examples include the segregation of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al. 2003) from C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1957). Other
Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C. gloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently host-specialized, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these authors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to understand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host species, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria, growth rate in culture, color of cultures, presence or absence of setae, and whether or not the teleomorph develops. Some studies have found these characters useful for distinguishing groups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g., Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956, Hindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems arise because many of these morphological features change under different growth conditions (dependent on growth media, temperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or changed with repeated subculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled; even well-defined pathogens causing specific diseases can be isolated by chance from other substrates (e.g., Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum conidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium, remain attached to that surface as a viable propagule, or perhaps as a minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow into senescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity. In addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct sets of isolates, with shared pathogenicity presumably evolved independently; for example, the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members of both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes (Johnston et al. 2005). Sutton (1992) remarked that “no progress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging to this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone.” A start was made towards a modern understanding of this name with the designation of an epitype specimen and a culture derived from it to stabilize the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs to a strongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have been confused with C. gloeosporioides in the past, such as C. acutatum and C. boninense (e.g., Abang et al. 2002, Martinez-Culebras et al. 2003, Johnston et al. 2005, Chung et al. 2006, Farr et al. 2006, Than et al. 2008). However, biological and genetic relationships within the broad C. gloeosporioides clade remain confused, and ITS sequences alone are insufficient to resolve them. In this study, we define the limits of the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on ITS sequences, with the species we accept forming a strongly supported clade in the ITS gene tree. In all cases, the taxa included in the C. gloeosporioides complex fit within the traditional morphological concept of the C. gloeosporioides group (
While some authors have embraced a genetically highly restricted concept for C. gloeosporioides, many applied researchers continue to use the name in a broad, group-species concept. In this paper, we accept both concepts as useful and valid. When used in a broad sense, we refer to the taxon as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat. This paper aims to clarify the genetic and taxonomic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides species complex using a set of isolates that widely samples its genetic, biological, and geographic diversity. Type specimens, or cultures derived from type specimens, have been examined wherever possible. Although we do not treat all of the names placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller, we treat all names for which a possible close relationship with C. gloeosporioides has been suggested in the recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata. ITS sequences, the official barcoding gene for fungi, do not reliably resolve relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. We define species in the complex genetically rather than morphologically, based on phylogenetic analyses of up to eight genes. Following Cannon et al., the generic name Colletotrichum is used as the preferred generic name for all species wherever possible throughout this paper, whether or not a Glomerella state has been observed for that fungus, and whether or not the Glomerella state has a formal name.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Specimen isolation and selection
An attempt was made to sample the genetic diversity across C. gloeosporioides as widely as possible, with isolates from diverse hosts from around the world selected for more intensive study. A BLAST search of GenBank using the ITS sequence of the epitype culture of C. gloeosporioides provided a coarse estimate for the genetic limit of the C. gloeosporioides complex, and ITS diversity across the complex was used to select a genetically diverse set of isolates. Voucher cul
Most of the New Zealand isolates had been stored as conidial suspensions made from single conidium or ascospore cultures and then stored at -80 °C in a 5% glycerol/water suspension. Additional isolates from New Zealand were obtained from the ICMP culture collection, where isolates are stored as lyophilised (freeze-dried) ampoules or in a metabolically inactive state in liquid nitrogen at -196 °C. The storage history of most of the isolates received from other research groups is not known. The isolates studied are detailed in the document. All those supplying cultures are acknowledged at the end of this manuscript, and additional details on each culture are available through the ICMP.

Mycelium was collected from isolates grown on PDA agar and manually comminuted with a micropestle in 420 μL of Qiagen DXT tissue digest buffer; 4.2 μL of proteinase K was added and incubated at 55 °C for 1 hour. After a brief centrifugation, 220 μL of the supernatant was placed in a Corbett X-tractorGene automated nucleic acid extraction robot. The resulting 100 μL of pure DNA in TE buffer was stored at -30 °C in 1.5 mL tubes until use. Gene sequences were obtained from eight nuclear gene regions: actin (ACT) [316 bp], calmodulin (CAL) [756 bp], chitin synthase (CHS-1) [229 bp], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [308 bp], the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) [615 bp],
PCR buffer (with 20 mM MgCl2), 2.5 μL of dNTPs (each 20 μM), 1 μL of each primer (10 μM), 1 μL of BSA, 1 μL of genomic DNA, and 0.2 μL (1 U) of Roche FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase were used for the reactions. The PCR conditions for ITS included 4 minutes at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, 52 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 45 seconds, and a final extension of 7 minutes at 72 °C. The annealing temperatures varied for the other genes, with the optimal temperatures being: ACT: 58 °C, CAL: 59 °C, CHS 1: 58 °C, GAPDH: 60 °C, GS: 54 °C, SOD2: 54 °C, and TUB2: 55 °C. Some isolates required altered temperatures and occasionally yielded multiple bands, which were excised separately from an electrophoresis gel and purified. PCR products were purified using a Qiagen MinElute 96 UF PCR Purification Plate. DNA sequences were obtained in both directions on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Avant Genetic Analyzer using BigDye v. 3.1 chemistry. Electropherograms were analyzed and assembled in Sequencher v. 4.10.1 (Gene Codes Corp.).
For phylogenetic analyses, multiple sequence alignments of each gene were created with ClustalX v. 2.1 and manually adjusted as needed using Geneious Pro v. 5.5.6. Bayesian inference (BI) was utilized to reconstruct most phylogenies using MrBayes v. 3.2.1. Bayesian inference has significant advantages over other analysis methods, such as maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony, and provides measures of clade support as posterior probabilities rather than random resampling bootstraps. jModelTest v. 0.1.1 was used for statistical selection of best-fit models of nucleotide substitution based on the corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc). Initial analyses indicated that individual genes were broadly congruent; therefore, nucleotide alignments of all genes were concatenated using Geneious, creating separate partitions for each gene with their respective model of nucleotide substitution. Analyses on the full dataset were executed twice for 5 x 10^7 generations and twice for 2 x 10^7 generations for the clade trees, with samples taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. Convergence of all parameters was checked using the internal diagnostics of the standard deviation of split frequencies and performance scale reduction factors (PSRF), as well as externally with Tracer v. 1.5. Based on this assessment, the first 25% of generations were discarded as burn-in.
An initial BI analysis included all 158 isolates using a concatenated alignment for five of the genes: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS, with Colletotrichum boninense and C. hippeastri serving as outgroups. A second BI analysis focused on ex-type or authentic isolates of each accepted species, based on a concatenated alignment of all eight genes. A third set of BI analyses focused on t

Stylosanthes guianensis is a species native to Australia. The following information details various accession numbers and locations associated with this species:
The table summarizes several species, their culture sources, host plants, countries, and corresponding GenBank accession numbers. Notable entries include:
Each entry provides various accession numbers associated with different genes like ITS, GPDH, CAL, ACT, CHS, GSS, SOD2, and TUB2, demonstrating the diversity of genetic data for these species. Some entries also note ex-type or authentic cultures, and sequences downloaded from GenBank are highlighted.
Collection abbreviations are listed in the methods. Several species-tree analyses were conducted using BEAST v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012). Species trees combine multi-gene and multiple isolate data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hypothesized species, rather than individual isolates. BEAST does not use concatenation but rather co-estimates the individual gene trees embedded inside the summary species tree. It also estimates the time since each species shared a common ancestor (divergence times). For these analyses, the species tree ancestral reconstruction option was selected (Heled & Drummond 2010), the gene data partitioned as for Bayesian Inference (BI), and the substitution model for each gene was selected based on the models chosen using jModelTest. The individual isolates were grouped into sets of species by setting species names as trait values. A strict clock was used for the GAPDH gene (as an all intronic sequence, it was assumed to be accumulating mutations at a steady rate), and the other gene clock rates were estimated relative to GAPDH using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock. The species tree prior used for all genes was the Yule process, with the ploidy type set to nuclear autosomal. Uninformative priors were used for all parameters and were allowed to auto-optimize. The first species-tree analysis was conducted using the 158 isolate, five-gene dataset, with C. boninense and C. hippeastri as the outgroups. The Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) chain was set to 1 × 10^8 generations for the species complex tree, and samples were taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. The analysis was run twice independently. The effective sample size (ESS), traces of all parameters, and convergence of the two runs were checked with Tracer, and a summary maximum clade credibility species tree was built with TreeAnnotator v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012) using a 10% burn-in and a posterior probability limit of 0.5, setting the heights of each node in the tree to the mean height across the entire sample of trees for that clade. Separate analyses were conducted using all eight genes and the same restricted set of isolates chosen to represent taxa within the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade as were used for the BI analyses of the eight-gene concatenated analyses outlined above. For each of the Musae and Kahawae clade analyses, the MCMC chain was set to 5 × 10^7 generations, but otherwise run as for the five-gene dataset. To illustrate the potential limitations of ITS to discriminate species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, a UPGMA tree was built of all 158 ITS sequences using the Geneious tree builder tool. A UPGMA tree visually approximates a BLAST search, which is based on distances (and sequence length) rather than corrected nucleotide substitutions of more sophisticated, model-based analyses. Sequences derived in this study were lodged in GenBank, the concatenated alignment and trees in TreeBASE, and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank.
Detailed morphological descriptions are provided only for those species with no recently published description. Few specimens were examined from infected host material; the descriptions provided are mostly from agar cultures. Cultures were grown on Difco PDA from single conidia, or from single hyphal tips for the few specimens where no conidia were formed, with culture diameter measured and appearance described after
Conidia were measured and described using conidia taken from the conidial ooze on acervuli and mounted in lactic acid. At least 24 conidia were measured for each isolate, and range measurements are provided in the form (lower extreme–) 25 % quartile – 75 % quartile (–upper extreme), with all ranges rounded to the nearest 0.5 µm. Cultures were examined periodically for the development of perithecia. Ascospores were measured and described from perithecia crushed in lactic acid. Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, where a small square of agar was inoculated on one side with conidia and immediately covered with a sterile cover slip. After 14 days, the cover slip was removed and placed in a drop of lactic acid on a glass slide. All morphological character measurements were analyzed with the statistical program “R” v. 2.14.0 (R Development Core Team 2011). The R package ggplot2 (Wickham 2009) was used for graphical plots. The box plots show the median, upper and lower quartiles, and the ‘whisker’ extends to the outlying data, or to a maximum of 1.5 times the interquartile range, with individual outliers outside this range represented as dots.
In the taxonomic section, species, subspecific taxa, and formae speciales within the C. gloeosporioides species complex are treated alphabetically by epithet. The names of formae speciales are not governed by the International Code of Botanical Nomenclature (ICBN) (McNeill et al. 2006, Art. 4, Note 4), and are hence enclosed in quotation marks to indicate their invalid status. Other invalid names governed by the ICBN are also enclosed in quotation marks. Accepted names are marked with an asterisk (*). The breadth of the taxonomic names treated includes all names with DNA sequence data in GenBank that place them in the C. gloeosporioides complex as defined here based on the ITS gene tree. It is important to note that the usage of names in GenBank may have been misapplied. This includes names used in recent literature suggesting a possible relationship to C. gloeosporioides, as well as all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata. However, the full set of species in Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium, and Glomerella that were placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954) or von Arx (1957, 197

We have not considered the full set of species in Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium, and Glomerella that were placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller or von Arx. For each accepted species, comments are provided regarding the limitations of ITS, the official barcoding gene for fungi, to distinguish that species from others within the C. gloeosporioides complex.
The study employed various primers for different genes. The primers included ACT for actin, CAL for calmodulin, CHS-1 for chitin synthase, GAPDH for glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, GS for glutamine synthetase, and ITS for internal transcribed spacer. Each primer had specified sequences and references, detailing both forward and reverse directions. The table summarizes the gene names, primer directions, sequences, and correspondi
Kahawae clades provide a finer resolution of evolutionary history within each clade, with the time scale based on the same calibration as the referenced figure. The UPGMA-based ITS gene tree indicates that C. theobromicola, C. horii, C. gloeosporioides, G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”, C. asianum, C. musae, C. alatae, and C. xanthorrhoeae all form monophyletic clades and can be distinguished using ITS. However, many species cannot be discriminated using this gene alone. It is important to note that C. cordylinicola and C. psidii are represented by a single isolate, meaning that variation within ITS sequences across these species has not been tested.
Brief morphological descriptions, based on all specimens examined, are provided only for those species without recent descriptions. Conidial sizes for all accepted species are summarized in the text. Within a species, conidial sizes are generally consistent across isolates, regardless of geographic origin or host. However, differences between species are often slight, with size ranges frequently overlapping. The shape of appressoria is typically consistent within a species, with some being simple in outline and others complex and highly lobed. Several species are characterized in part by the development of perithecia in culture, including four species in the Musae clade (C. alienum, C. fructicola, C. queenslandicum, and C. salsolae) and three in the Kahawae clade (C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. ti). Ascospore size and shape can serve as useful diagnostic features at the species level. In most species, the ascospores are strongly curved and taper towards the ends, while in C. clidemiae and C. ti, they are more or less elliptic with broadly rounded ends and are not, or only slightly, curved.
Individual isolates within any of these species may lose the ability to form perithecia, potentially due to cultural changes during storage. Large, dark-walled stromatic structures are present in cultures of some species not known to form perithecia. Often embedded in agar, and less commonly on the surface or among the aerial mycelium, these structures differ from perithecia, consisting of a compact tissue of tightly tangled hyphae rather than the pseudoparenchymatous, angular cells typical of perithecial walls. They have a soft, leathery texture compared to the more brittle perithecia. These stromatic structures may develop a conidiogenous layer internally, and after produc

Zealand C. alienum is commonly associated with cultivated fruits, whereas species such as C. siamense and C. fructicola, which are common on these same cultivated fruits in other parts of the world, have not been reported from New Zealand.
Taxonomy: Based on the results of the multigene concatenated BI phylogenies, we accept 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Isolates authentic for G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” form a genetically distinct group, but this is not formally named due to doubts over its relationship to C. camelliae. Based on DNA sequence comparisons, a few other isolates almost certainly represent additional unnamed species. We do not formally describe them because most are known from a single isolate, often stale, with little understanding of either their morphological or biological diversity.
In the Musae clade, these include ICMP 18614 and ICMP 18616, both from grape from Japan, and ICMP 18726 from pawpaw from the Cook Islands. In the Kahawae clade, ICMP 18699 is from chestnut from Japan. These isolates are not included in the phylogenies in this study.
The table provides a comprehensive list of various isolates along with their corresponding species and origins. Notable entries include ICMP isolates from diverse regions such as New Zealand, Australia, and Japan, representing multiple species, including C. theobromicola and C. psidii. Some isolates are associated with specific plants, like Fragaria and Theobroma, indicating a rich diversity of fungal species linked to various host plants across different geographical locations. Additionally, the table illustrates relationships among species through numerical values that likely represent genetic similarities or differences.

An unrooted Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree illustrates the genetic distances among 24 taxa within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. This tree is divided into two clusters: the ‘Musae clade’ and the ‘Kahawae clade.’ It was constructed using concatenated sequences of multiple genes, each analyzed with a distinct model of DNA evolution.
A Bayesian inference species-tree was created by grouping 158 isolates into species while estimating the individual gene trees and the summary species tree using BEAST. The scale is set relative to the last common ancestor of the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes.
The table details various isolates of the C. gloeosporioides species complex from different regions, indicating their respective hosts and geographical locations. It presents information on isolates from Nigeria, Panama, Italy, Australia, Vietnam, Germ
A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 32 selected isolates in the Musae clade of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex was constructed. The tree was built using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, GS, ITS, and SOD2 genes, each with a separate model of DNA evolution. Additional details are referenced in another figure. A species tree constructed from the same data is scaled relative to the last common ancestor of the Musae clade and C. gloeosporioides s. str. Many recognized species fall into one of two clades: the informally named Musae clade and Kahawae clade. Each clade contains several species that are phylogenetically well supported in multi-gene analyses, but the branch lengths within the clades are short due to a limited number of phylogenetically informative characters. This is reflected in the low support values observed in gene tree analyses for the accepted species within those clades. Both the Musae and Kahawae clades include ex-type or authentic cultures from several long-accepted species. To minimize taxonomic disruption, monophyletic subclades within the Kahawae and Musae clades are accepted as species where they include ex-type or authentic cultures. The Musae clade includes C. fructicola, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale, while the Kahawae clade includes C. cordylinicola, C. psidii, and C. kahawae, with Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” also belonging to the latter. Several new species and one new subspecies are proposed to provide a consistent taxonomic treatment of the subclades within the Musae and Kahawae clades. In the Musae clade, these are C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum, C. queenslandicum, and C. salsolae. In the Kahawae clade, the new species are C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. ti. The other accepted species, well resolved in all gene trees, include C. alatae, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. theobromicola, and C. xanthorrhoeae.
A detailed description of the table includes various strains of Colletotrichum, their origins, and host plants. Notable entries include C. gloeosporioides from Citrus in Italy, C. aotearoa from Coprosma in New Zealand, and C. kahawae from Coffea in Kenya. The table also presents other strains with specific details, indicating their geographic origins and associated plant species, reflecting a diverse representation of isolates across different regions. Each entry includes an identification code along with the plant species from which the isolate was obtained, highlighting the ecological and geographical diversity of the samples.
Here is the revised text:
Fig. 5. A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 30 selected isolates in the Kahawae clade of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. The tree was built using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, GS, ITS, and SOD2 genes, each with a separate model of DNA evolution. Other details are as per Fig. 1. B. A species tree constructed from the same data, the scale is a clock set relative to the last common ancestor of the Kahawae clade and C. gloeosporioides s. str., as calibrated in Fig. 3. The tree illustrates the evolutionary relationships among various isolates, highlighting their genetic divergence.
Fig. 6. An UPGMA tree of ITS sequences from 156 isolates in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. Isolate names have been replaced with species present in each clade. Species that are in monophyletic clades are emphasized in bold font to indicate those for which ITS barcoding is likely to work well. B: A 50% majority-rule consensus Bayesian inference tree of the same data shows the collapse of structure when analyzed with a more robust method.
Fig. 7. Box plots show the variation in length and width of conidia produced by the cultures examined in this study. The dashed lines indicate the mean length (16.74 µm) and width (5.1 µm) across the species complex (n = 1958). The plots represent the conidial dimensions of various species within the complex, demonstrating significant variability among them.
Fig. 8. Box plots show the variation in length and width of ascospores produced by the cultures examined in this study. The dashed lines indicate the mean length (17.46 µm) and width (4.8 µm) across the species complex (n = 452). The plots illustrate the differences in ascospore dimensions among species, providing insight into their morphological diversity.
Cultural size at 10 days is measured in diameter (mm), showing the growth rates of different species. The data reflect the diverse growth patterns and sizes of the examined isolates, which are crucial for understanding their ecological and biological characteristics.
Fig. 9. A box plot of the diameter of cultures grown on PDA agar at 18 °C for 10 days. The dashed line shows the mean culture size (61.56 mm) across the species complex (n = 719). Note that the data is skewed by some fast-growing cultures that reached the agar plate diameter (85 mm) in under 10 days.
The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex includes Colletotrichum aenigma B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563759. Etymology: from the Latin aenigma, based on the enigmatic biological and geographic distribution of this species. Holotype: Israel, on Persea americana, coll. S. Freeman Avo-37 4B, PDD 102233; ex-holotype culture ICMP 18608. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA reach 30–35 mm in diameter after 10 days. Aerial mycelium is sparse, cottony, and white, with the surface of the agar uniformly pale orange (7A5) towards the center and more or less colorless towards the edge. Conidia are not associated with well-differentiated acervuli, and there are no masses of conidial ooze. The reverse side is pale orange towards the center. Conidiogenous cells arise haphazardly from dense, tangled hyphae across the agar surface, appearing short-cylindric with a poorly differentiated conidiogenous locus. Conidia often germinate soon after release, sometimes forming appressoria, creating a thin, compact layer of germinated, septate conidia, germ tubes, and appressoria across the central part of the colony surface. Conidia measure (12–)14–15(–16.5) × (5–)6–6.5(–7.5) µm (average 14.5 × 6.1 µm, n = 53), are cylindric with broadly rounded ends, and appressoria are 6–10 µm in diameter, subglobose or with a few broad lobes. Geographic distribution and host range: Known from only two collections, one from Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and the other from Persea americana in Israel. Genetic identification: ITS sequences are insufficient to separate C. aenigma from C. alienum and some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using TUB2 or GS. Notes: Although the biology of this species is largely unknown, it has been found in two widely separate regions and is, therefore, likely to be found to be geographically widespread in the future. Genetically distinct within the Musae clade, this species has a distinctive appearance in culture with sparse, pale aerial mycelium and lacks differentiated acervuli. Other specimens examined include one from Japan on Pyrus pyrifolia, coll. H. Ishii Nashi-10 (ICMP 18686).
Colletotrichum aeschynomenes B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563590. This species is synonymous with C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” (Daniel et a
Notes: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” has been used to refer to isolates pathogenic to Aeschynomene virginica, later developed as the weed biocontrol agent Collego. It has also been reported from a range of other hosts. Our analyses, based on a single, authentic strain of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” (TeBeest 3.1.3, apparently the source of the single spore isolate originally used in the development of Collego), show it to be genetically distinct within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Genetically close to the geographically and biologically diverse C. siamense, it differs morphologically from this species in having slightly longer and narrower conidia that taper slightly toward the ends, and in having larger, strongly lobed appressoria. An isolate deposited as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes in CBS (CBS 796.72) by G.E. Templeton, one of the early C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes researchers, is genetically distinct from TeBeest 3.1.3 and has been identified as C. godetiae, a member of the C. acutatum complex. The strain we examined (Te Beest 3.1.3) matches genetically another strain often cited in the C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes literature (Clar 5a = ATCC 96723). It is possible that two distinct species, both highly pathogenic to Aeschynomene in Arkansas, have been confused. A survey of additional isolates of Colletotrichum highly virulent to Aeschynomene in Arkansas would clarify the interpretation of the past literature on this pathogen. For example, C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” was initially reported as specific to Aeschynomene virginica, while later studies reported isolates putatively of the same taxon to have a wider host range. Cisar et al. reported fertile ascospores from crosses between isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” and isolates of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae”, a pathogen of Jussiaea decurrens. The position of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” within our phylogeny is not known, but these taxa could prove useful for better understanding of the biological differences between phylogenetically defined species of Colletotrichum. Specimen examined: USA, Arkansas, on Aeschynomene virginica stem lesion, collected by D. TeBeest 3.1.3.
The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex exhibits distinct morphological characteristics. ICMP 18122 shows sparse aerial mycelium with a colony surface featuring numerous discrete, dark-based acervuli and bright orange conidial ooze. The colony margin is feathery, and the reverse displays irregular sectors with pale grey pigment, apart from the coloration of the acervuli and conidial masses. Conidia measure (14.5−) 18–19.5(−23.5) × (4.5−) 5−5.5(−6.5) µm (average 18.9 × 5.2 µm, n = 40), are cylindric, straight, and rounded at the ends, with some tapering towards the basal end. Appressoria are mostly simple, elliptic to fusoid, sometimes developing broad, irregular lobes, measuring about 7–13.5 × 5–10.5 µm. Perithecia were not observed.
Colletotrichum aeschynomenes (ICMP 17673) is represented by appressoria, conidiogenous cells, and conidia. Cultures on PDA were observed after 10 days of growth from single conidia, with visual representations from above and below.
Colletotrichum alatae (ICMP 18122) is similarly documented, featuring cultures on PDA and various morphological structures. Scale bars for appressoria and setae measure 20 µm.
Geographic distribution and host range for C. alatae include yam (Dioscorea alata) found in Nigeria, Barbados, India, and Guadeloupe. Genetic identification through ITS sequences distinguishes C. alatae from other taxa.
Notes indicate that anthracnose diseases of yam are prevalent in regions where the host is cultivated. Morphological and genetic studies show diversity among isolates from diseased yam leaves. While early researchers grouped all yam isolates under C. gloeosporioides, this paper identifies part of that diversity as a distinct species, C. alatae. The type specimen of C. alatae corresponds with the SGG (slow growing grey) group identified by earlier studies as being more pathogenic to yam than other groups within C. gloeosporioides. Additional isolates from yam in Barbados, Guadeloupe, and India are included in this clade, while no isolates from other hosts have been identified.
Some sequenced isolates from yam represent the FGS group distinguished by faster growth and shorter conidia compared to the highly pathogenic SGG isolates. Two isolates genetically match C. fructicola, while the others match C. siamense. Various names have been assigned to Colletotrichum specimens associated with anthracnose in yam, reflecting the broad genetic diversity of the species. Due to the uncertainty surrounding early type specimens, these names are not utilized for the newly recognized yam-specialized pathogen.
Colletotrichum population associated with diseased foliage is not known. Other specimens examined include: Nigeria, Kpite, on Dioscorea alata leaf, collected by M.M. Abang, Cg25, 2001. Colletotrichum alienum B. Weir & P.R. Johnston, sp. nov. MycoBank MB563591. Figs 13, 14. Etymology: This species is named based on its biology, which is confined to exotic hosts and is presumed to be a recent introduction to Australasia. Holotype: New Zealand, Auckland, Kumeu research orchard, on Malus domestica fruit rot, collected by P.R. Johnston, C824, 14 Aug. 1987, PDD 101996; ex-type culture ICMP 12071. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA, 85 mm diameter after 10 days. Colonies often exhibit distinct sectors; some show cottony, grey aerial mycelium with numerous dark-based acervuli and orange conidial ooze visible through the mycelium, while others have dense, cottony to felted mycelium with fewer acervuli, which are hidden by the dense mycelium. In reverse, irregular dark grey patches and sectors mask the pale orange pigmentation. ICMP 18691 appears “stale” with slow growth, dense, pale aerial mycelium, sparse conidial production, and no perithecia. Conidia measure (12.5–) 15.5–17.5(–22) × (3–)5–5.5(–6) µm (average 16.5 × 5.0 µm, n = 70), cylindric with broadly rounded ends. Appressoria are mostly simple, globose to short-cylindric, with a few having broad, irregular lobes; ICMP 18691 has primarily lobed appressoria. Perithecia form in most cultures after about 10 days, appearing dark-walled and globose with a short, narrow ostiolar neck. Ascospores measure (14.5–) 17–19.5(–22) × 4–5(–6) µm (average 18.1 × 4.6 µm, n = 55), cylindric, curved, and tapering slightly at each end. Geographic distribution and host range: This species is known only from Australia and New Zealand and is common on a wide range of introduced fruit crops. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. alienum from some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using CAL or GS. Notes: Common on commercial fruit crops, this fungus was referred to as C. gloeosporioides Group A by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005). Other specimens examined include: Australia, New South Wales, Murwillumbah, on Persea americana (DAR 37820 = IMI 313842 = ICMP 18691). New Zealand, Auckland, Oratia, Shaw Rd, on Malus domestica fruit rot, collected by P.R. Johnston, C938.5, 14 Apr. 1988 (ICMP 18725); Bay of Plenty, Katikati, on Diospyros kaki ripe fruit rot, collected by M.A. Manning, Jun. 1989 (ICMP 17972); Bay of Plenty, Te Puke, on Persea americana ripe fruit rot, collected by W.F.T. Hartill, 2 Feb. 1988 (ICMP 18704); Bay of Plenty, Te Puna, on
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 70–85 mm in diameter after 10 days, with several isolates exhibiting restricted growth, measuring 50–55 mm in diameter and having an irregularly scalloped margin. The aerial mycelium is cottony to dense cottony, tufted near the center, and ranges from grey to dark grey. Small, dark-based acervuli and large, globose stromatic structures are partially embedded in the agar, sometimes splitting apart and forming conidia. The reverse typically displays pinkish-orange pigments, variable in intensity; in some isolates, this color is partially obscured by more or less concentric bands of dark grey pigment. Conidia measure (12–)16–17.5(–21.5) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6.5) µm (average 16.9 × 5.2 µm, n = 216), are cylindric, straight, with a broadly rounded apex, often tapering slightly towards a subtruncate base, and are 0-septate and hyaline.
Appressoria are variable in shape, ranging from simple to broadly lobed, sometimes appearing in groups or intercalary, measuring about 7–17 × 4–9.5 µm. Perithecia were not observed in culture.
Geographic distribution and host range: Confirmed only from New Zealand, but GenBank records suggest that C. aotearoa may also occur in China. In New Zealand, this species is common on a taxonomically diverse set of native plants, acting as both a fruit rot and a leaf endophyte, and has also been isolated from the leaves of several species of naturalized weeds.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. aotearoa from several taxa in the Kahawae and Musae clades. This species can be distinguished using several other genes, including TUB2, CAL, GS, and GAPDH.
Notes: All isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex from New Zealand native plants studied belong to the Kahawae clade, with most being C. aotearoa; a small number of leaf endophyte isolates from New Zealand native trees are C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. The C. aotearoa isolates have been isolated as endophytes from symptomless leaves as well as from rotting fruit from native trees. Although morphologically indistinguishable from isolates of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, this species can be genetically distinguished with all sampled genes except ITS. The GAPDH gene tree divides C. aotearoa into two well-supported clades, which do not correlate with any other features, either geographic or biological. Isolates associated with distinctive and common leaf spots on Meryta sinclairii, first recorded by Beever (1984), belong to this species. It is not known whether isolates of C. aotearoa from other hosts can cause the same disease on Meryta.
C. aotearoa includes a range of isolates from weeds that have become naturalized in New Zealand. It is assumed that C. aotearoa is a New Zealand native species with a broad host range among native plants and has apparently jumped to some weeds. It has never been found associated with cultivated plants or as a rot of cultivated fruit.
C. aotearoa may also occur in China. ITS sequences fro

Colletotrichum asianum Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Fungal Diversity 39: 96. 2009. Geographic distribution and host range: Known on Mangifera indica from Australia, Colombia, Japan, Panama, Philippines, and
Three earlier species, originally described from leaves rather than fruit of Mangifera, may provide earlier names for C. asianum, but type material for these species has not been examined in this study: C. mangiferae Kelkar, Gloeosporium mangiferae Henn. 1898, and G. mangiferae Racib. 1900. As with most substrates, several different species of Colletotrichum often occur on the same host. For example, Damm et al. (2012a, b, this issue) report members of the C. acutatum and C. boninense species complexes, C. simmondsii, C. fioriniae, and C. karstii from mango in Australia. Isolates from Capsicum reported by Than et al. (2008) as C. gloeosporioides Morphological Group 2 (e.g., isolates Ku4 = ICMP 18575 and Ku8 = ICMP 18618) were referred to as C. asianum by Hyde et al. (2009); however, they are genetically distinct from C. asianum and belong to C. siamense based on our analyses. The C. asianum protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090234, and the culture derived from the holotype as “BCC” with no strain number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I4 in the Prihastuti et al. (2009) Table 1, but this number is not mentioned in the description. Culture BDP-I4 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study.
Specimens examined include various locations and hosts: Australia, New South Wales, Sextonville, on Mangifera indica, 1987 (IMI 313839 = ICMP 18696); Philippines, on Mangifera indica (MAFF 306627 = ICMP 18603); Thailand, Chiang Mai, on Mangifera indica fruit, coll.

Colletotrichum boehmeriae Sawada was described as a stem pathogen of Boehmeria nivea and remains in use in this sense (e.g., Li &
We have been unable to sample Colletotrichum isolates from tea with typical brown blight symptoms. There are four GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from tea: two from China, one from Japan, and another from Iran, referred to variously as C. camelliae, C. crassipes, and C. gloeosporioides. Although only ITS sequences are available for these geographically widespread isolates, the DNA sequence of the Iranian isolate appears to match C. gloeosporioides s. str., while the other three isolates are very similar to each other. The ITS sequence from these isolates matches that of CBS 232.79, from tea shoots in Java. GAPDH and ITS sequences from CBS 232.79 place this isolate in C. fructicola. It is important to note that CBS 571.88, isolated from tea in China and deposited as Glomerella cingulata, is a Colletotrichum sp. outside C. gloeosporioides s. lat., based on ITS sequences. We tested the pathogenicity of CBS 232.79 and isolates of G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” using detached tea leaves and found that only the G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” isolates were strong pathogens. The genetic relationship between the pathogen of ornamental Camellia (referred to as G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”), isolates from tea with DNA sequence data in GenBank, and isolates associated with brown blight symptoms of tea remains unresolved. Additional isolates with known pathogenicity, collected from typical brown blight symptoms in the field, are required to determine whether there are two distinct pathogens of Camellia: one for tea and another for ornamental varieties.
Other Colletotrichum species reported from tea include C. “theae-sinensis”, an invalid recombination of Gloeosporium theae sinensis I. Miyake, proposed by Yamamoto. Moriwaki and Sato summarized the taxonomic history of this name and transferred G. theae-sinensis to Discula based on DNA sequences. Sphaerella camelliae Cooke and its recombination Laestadia camelliae were listed as synonyms of Glomerella cingulata. This species is now accepted as Guignardia camelliae and is regarded as the causal agent of copper blight disease of tea. Thang placed C. camelliae in synonymy with C. coccodes, questioning this synonymy by noting differences in descriptions of the two species provided by Massee and Sutton. Colletotrichum caricae F. Stevens & J.G. Hall was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides, though it was listed as a separate species by Sutton. Described from fruits and leaves of Ficus carica from the USA, it remains poorly understood both morphologically and biologically. Its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, as well as to other Ficus-associated species such as Colletotrichum ficus and Glomerella cingulata var. minor, is unknown. Glomerella cingulata was first described in the early 1900s and has undergone several nomenclatural changes, reflecting its complex taxonomic history.
Notes: Stoneman (1898) described Glomerella cingulata from diseased stems of Ligustrum vulgare from the USA and reported the development of perithecia in cultures initiated from conidia of what she considered its asexual morph, Gloeosporium cingulatum. There are recent reports of anthracnose diseases of Ligustrum (e.g., Alfieri et al. 1984, Vajna & Bagyinka 2002), but the relationship of isolates causing this disease to the C. gloeosporioides complex is not known. Glomerella cingulata is often linked taxonomically to the anamorph Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, and the name has, in the past, been applied in an equally broad sense to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. (e.g., Small 1926, von Arx & Müller 1954). However, it is unlikely that the type specimen of G. cingulata represents the same species as C. gloeosporioides s. str. (see notes under C. gloeosporioides). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s. str. is not known to form perithecia in culture, and there are no isolates of C. gloeosporioides s. str. associated with a Glomerella state on diseased stems of Ligustrum. An isolate of C. Weir et al. 146 aotearoa (ICMP 18748) was isolated from Ligustrum lucidum in New Zealand, but it was not associated with a stem lesion, and no C. aotearoa isolates were observed forming perithecia.
Glomerella cingulata var. brevispora Wollenw., Z. Parasitenk. (Berlin) 14: 260. 1949. Notes: Described from fruit rots from Germany, this name has not been used since. No cultures are available, and its relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides complex is not known.
Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” (Dickens & Cook 1989). Figs 18, 19. Notes: Dickens & Cook (1989) proposed the name Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” for isolates morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides s. lat. that were highly pathogenic to leaves and shoots of ornamental Camellia saluenensis hybrids, causing the disease Camellia twig blight. These authors reported the fungus from plants imported into the UK from New Zealand and noted that a similar disease had been reported from plants grown in the UK. The disease has been reported
Dickens and Cook (1989) also reported two C. acutatum strains from ornamental Camellia species that were avirulent in tests with detached Camellia cv. Donation leaves. Strain IMI 351261, deposited in 1992 by R. Cook, is likely one of them. This strain was confirmed as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex and identified as C. lupini, which causes lupin anthracnose and is occasionally found on other hosts (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Another strain from Camellia reticulata from China belongs to C. fioriniae, also a species in the C. acutatum complex, while a strain from New Zealand (ICMP 10338) is C. boninense s. str. (Damm et al. 2012a, b, this issue). Specimens examined include those from the UK, where plants imported from New Zealand on Camellia × williamsii were collected by Dickens and Cook in 1982 (authentic culture of Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” – ICMP 10643; dried culture PDD 56488). In the USA, a collection from Mississippi on Camellia sasanqua twig blight was made by W.E. Copes in May 2002 (ICMP 18542), and another from South Carolina on Camellia sp. was collected by G. Laundon on January 1, 1982 (ICMP 10646).
Glomerella cingulata var. crassispora Wollenw., described in Z. Parasitenk. (Berlin) 14: 260, 1949, was noted as being derived from Coffea arabica in a glasshouse in Germany, but this name has not been used since, and no cultures are available. Its relationship within the C. gloeosporioides complex remains unknown. Additionally, Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. manihotis” (Chevaugeon 1956) is referenced under Colletotrichum manihotis.
Glomerella cingulata var. minor Wollenw. was placed in synonymy with C. fructicola. This variety was originally described from Ficus in Germany; however, Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949) noted its occurrence on other hosts across Europe, Africa, and America, including Malus and Coffea. The ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. minor (CBS 238.49) matches the type specimen of C. fructicola, although the culture appears to be stale with slow growth and an irregularly scalloped margin. Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949) used the name Gloeosporium elasticae Cooke & Massee for the conidial state of G. cingulata var. minor, with type specimens from Ficus.
Specimens examined include one from Germany, Berlin-Dahlem, from Ficus edulis leaf spot i
Notes: Both Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. phaseoli” and Glomerella lindemuthiana have been used for the teleomorph of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in the recent literature, with the two names placed in synonymy by Sutton (1992). This fungus is not part of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Glomerella cingulata var. sorghicola Saccas, Agron. Trop. (Maracay) 9: 171. 1954. Notes: Not a member of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Sutton (1992) suggested using this name to refer to the teleomorph of Colletotrichum sublineola, although Crouch et al. (2006) note that C. sublineola has no known teleomorph.
Colletotrichum clidemiae B. Weir & P.R. Johnst. sp. nov. MycoBank MB563592. Etymology: Based on the host reportedly susceptible to this species. Holotype: USA, Hawai’i, Aiea, on Clidemia hirta leaf spot, collected by S.A. Ferreira & K. Pitz, 14 May 2010, PDD 101997; ex-type culture ICMP 18658. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 25 mm in diameter after 10 days. The aerial mycelium is grey, cottony, and sparse, with the colony surface featuring numerous small, dark-based acervuli releasing deep orange conidial ooze and scattered setae. In reverse, the colony appears more or less colorless, except for the acervuli and masses of conidial ooze that are visible. After 18 days, numerous globose, pale-walled protoperithecia develop near the center of the colony.
Conidia measure (16−) 18−20 (−26.5) × (4.5−) 5.5−6 µm (average 19.3 × 5.5 µm, n = 48), broad-cylindric, with ends broadly rounded; longer conidia may taper slightly toward the base. Appressoria are variable in shape, some simple and subglobose, often with a small number of broad, irregular lobes. Perithecia mature after about 21 days, are dark-walled, about 200–250 µm in diameter with a short ostiolar neck, and have a perithecial wall composed of 3–4 layers of angular cells measuring 10–15 µ
Similar variation in cultural appearance is present in several of the phylogenetically defined species that we recognize. Whether the Clidemia-associated isolates are biologically distinct from the Vitis- and Quercus-associated isolates from Florida requires pathogenicity tests to determine. Other specimens examined include those from Florida, USA, where a sample was collected on a Vitis sp. leaf by S. MacKenzie (SS-Grape-12, 2002, ICMP 18706) and from Aiea, Hawai’i, where samples were collected on Clidemia hirta leaf spots by S.A. Ferreira and K. Pitz on May 14, 2010 (ICMP 18659, ICMP 18660, ICMP 18661, ICMP 18662, ICMP 18663).
Colletotrichum coffeanum F. Noak was first described in Z. Pflanzenkrankh. in 1901. Waller et al. (1993) discussed the use of the names Colletotrichum coffeanum and Gloeosporium coffeanum Delacr., along with the geographic and biological differences between these species and the pathogen of coffee berries, C. kahawae. Both C. coffeanum and G. coffeanum were described from coffee leaves, distinguished by Noak (1901) based on the presence or absence of setae in the acervuli. There is a wide range of C. gloeosporioides-like species on coffee plants, as noted by Waller et al. (1993) regarding C. kahawae, and the relationships of C. coffeanum and G. coffeanum within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remain uncertain.
Colletotrichum clidemiae is represented in Figure 20, which shows various cultures: A, B, and E represent ICMP 18658, the ex-holotype culture, while C and D show ICMP 18706. Panels A and D display appressoria, B and C show asci and ascospores, and E shows conidia. The scale bar for panel C is 20 µm, and this scale applies to all images A–E.
Colletotrichum cordylines was described by Pollacci in 1899 from leaves of Cordyline indivisa in a botanical garden in Italy, although the genetic and biological status of this species remains unknown. Two Cordyline-associated species are accepted in this study: C. cordylinicola from Thailand and the newly described C. ti from New Zealand. Pollacci’s original description of C. cordylines is brief but specifies the presence of setae longer than 100 µm. C. cordylinicola is described as lacking
Akad. Wetensch., Afd. Natuurk., Sect. 2, 51(3): 77. 1957. Basionym: Gloeosporium crassipes Speg., Rivista Vitic. Enol. 2: 405. 1878. Notes: Several isolates identified as Colletotrichum crassipes that have sequences accessioned to GenBank belong in C. gloeosporioides s. lat. GenBank accessions identified as C. crassipes that have a publicly available culture include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (STE-U 5302 = CBS 112988 – AY376529, AY376577, FN557348, FN557538, and FN599821; STE-U 4445 = CBS 112984 – AY376530, AY376578, FN557347, FN557537, and FN599820), along with several other species outside of the C. gloeosporioides complex (CBS 169.59 = IMI 309371 – AJ536230, FN557344, and FN599817; CBS 159.75 – FN557345 and FN599818; CBS 109355 – FN557346 and FN599819). Those with no isolates in a public collection include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (CORCS3 cited in Yang et al. (2011), HM584410, HM582002, HM585412), C. fructicola (strain 080912009 Jining, unpublished data, FJ515007), and a possibly undescribed species within the Kahawae clade (strain SYJM02, unpublished data, JF923835). Originally described from the berries of Vitis vinifera from Italy (Spegazzini 1878), the identity of C. crassipes remains unresolved. There is confusion regarding its morphology. Von Arx (1970) uses the name C. crassipes for fungi in which setae are rare, conidia are 22–34 × 6–8 µm (more or less matching the original description), and the lobed appressoria are distinctively globose in shape. Sutton (1980) uses a different morphological concept—setae common (according to Sutton, these are rare in the otherwise morphologically similar C. musae), conidia 10–15 × 4.5–6.5 µm (Sutton’s concept of C. gloeosporioides is characterized by narrower conidia), and the appressoria deeply lobed. The conidial
There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex that inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008), isolates that genetically match the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name, MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on strawberries. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA. Further work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys, this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.
Xie et al. (2010b) provide a good example of the confusion that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated. Xie et al. (2010b) found four groups of isolates, each with a slightly different ITS sequence; two of those groups they considered to be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates as either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides, they used a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment, one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS sequences only—the genetic differences between some of these species are small and indicative only of possible relationships. However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences match those of the epitype of C. fragariae.
There are also several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue). Specimen examined: USA, Florida, on Fragaria × ananassa, coll. A.N. Brooks, 1931 (ex-epitype culture). Colletotrichum fructicola Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Fungal Diversity 39: 158. 2009. = Colletotrichum ignotum E.I. Rojas, S. A.

The C. fructicola protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090228, but the culture derived from the holotype is referred to as “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I16, but this number is not mentioned in the description. Culture BDP-I16 was obtained from the authors for this study and deposited as ICMP 18581.
Specimens examined include: Australia, Queensland, Bli-Bli, on Persea americana fruit rot, coll. L. Coates 24154 (ICMP 12568); Brazil, Rio Grande do Sul State, on Malus domestica leaf, coll. T.

In the collection from Canada, Ontario, cultures on Fragaria × ananassa were noted (IMI 345051 = ICMP 17819). In Germany, cultures from the Berlin-Dahlem Botanical Garden were found on Ficus edulis leaf spots (ex-holotype culture of Glomerella cingulata var. minor – CBS 238.49 = ICMP 17921). In Indonesia, a collection was made in Java, Bandung, Pangheotan Estate, on Camellia sinensis shoots, coll. H. Semangun, Apr. 1979 (CBS 232.79 = ICMP 18656).

Genetic identification: ITS separates C. gloeosporioides from all other species. Notes: The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is currently in common use in two senses: one is a genetically and biologically broad sense, following von Arx (1957, 1970) and Sutton (1992), which includes the entire species complex; the other is a strict sense, encompassing only those specimens genetically matching the epitype selected for this name by Cannon et al. (2008). Depending on the context, use of the name in either sense can be useful. When used in a broad sense in this paper, it is referred to as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is often linked taxonomically to the teleomorph Glomerella cingulata; see notes under G. cingulata.
Specimens examined: Australia, New South Wales, Tamworth, on Carya illinoinensis; Italy, Calabria, on Citrus sinensis (ex-epitype culture of C. gloeosporioides); on Citrus limon juice, collected by G.

Notes: Originally described from the leaves of seedlings of Hevea brasiliensis from Sri Lanka, this fungus was described with very broad conidia, 18–24 × 7.5–8 µm. Carpenter & Stevenson (1954) considered this and several other Colletotrichum, Gloeosporium, and Glomerella species described from rubber to be synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. The genetic relationship of these species to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. See also notes in Damm et al. (2012b, this issue) under Colletotrichum annelatum.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. hyperici” (Harris 1993). Notes: This name was first used by Harris (1993) for strains of C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Hypericum perforatum. Earlier studies by Hildebrand & Jensen (1991) had found the Hypericum pathogen to be pathogenic also on several other plants. The genetic relationship of the Hypericum pathogen to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. Note that the ex holotyp
Notes: Killgore et al. (1999) reported that the isolates they recognized as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” were highly specialized pathogens of Miconia calvescens, unable to infect the closely related Clidemia hirta. The original voucher cultures are no longer available (pers. comm., Robert Barreto). Recently collected isolates from Miconia from the type locality in Brazil have proved to be genetically diverse across the C. gloeosporioides species complex, with isolates in both the Kahawae and Musae clades (unpubl. data). For now, the genetic position of this pathogen remains unresolved.

(2008) clearly show that the Orthezia praelonga pathogen belongs in the C. acutatum species complex, despite referring to the fungus only as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. ortheziidae.” See also notes under C. nymphaeae in Damm et al. (2012a, this issue).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. pilosae” (Singh 1974). Notes: First described from leaves of Bidens pilosa, this name has not been used since it was described, and its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Munaut, Mycol. Res. 106: 591. 2002. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. theobromicola; see notes under C. theobromicola.
Irwin & Cameron (1978) and Munaut et al. (2002) described different diseases of Stylosanthes associated with Type A and Type B isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis, the two groups of isolates distinguished morphologically by growth rate in culture and by conidial morphology. Compared with Type A, the Type B isolates had a slower growth rate on PDA and conidia more variable in size and shape (Irwin & Cameron 1978). They were also distinguished genetically using RFLP and similar methods (e.g., Munaut et al. 1998, 200
Sherriff et al. (1994), using ITS2 and partial 28S rDNA sequences, found isolates they considered to represent C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Type A and Type B, respectively, to be genetically distinct. However, their ITS2 sequences show that the putative Type B isolate in their study was, in fact, a member of the C. boninense species complex.
Specimens examined: Australia, Queensland, Townsville, on Stylosanthes viscosa, collected by J.A.G. Irwin (21365, HM335), 1976 (ex-holotype culture of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis – MUCL 42294 = ICMP 17957 = CBS 124251); Samford, on Stylosanthes guianensis, collected by J.A.G. Irwin (21398, HM336), 1979 (MUCL 42295 = ICMP 17958 = CBS 124250).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis” (Munaut et al. 2002) is equivalent to Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. guianensis” (Vinijsanum et al. 1987). Notes: See notes and specimens examined under C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis” (Munaut et al. 2002). Notes: See notes and specimens examined under C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. uredinicola” (Singh 1975). Notes: Described from uredinia and telia of Ravenelia sessilis on pods of Albizia lebbek, this name has not been used since it was described, and its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown.
Colletotrichum gossypii Southw., J. Mycol. 6: 100. 1891. = Glomerella gossypii Edgerton, Mycologia 1: 119. 1909. Notes: This species was originally described from the USA and was reported to cause disease symptoms on all parts of cotton plants, but especially the bolls (Southworth 1891, Edgerton 1909). Isolates identified as C. gossypii by Shear & Wood (1907) were reportedly associated with a Glomere
Weir & Johnston (2010) and Xie et al. (2010a) provide descriptions. Geographic distribution and host range: Associated with fruit and stem disease of Diospyros kaki from China, Japan, and New Zealand. Xie et al. (2010a) noted minor symptoms on inoculated fruit of Capsicum annuum, Musa acuminata, and Cucurbita pepo, but noted that the fungus had never been associated with disease symptoms on these hosts from the field. Genetic identification: ITS distinguishes C. horii from all other species. Specimens examined: See Weir & Johnston (2010).
Colletotrichum hymenocallidis Yan L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138. 2009. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, also described from Hymenocallis, primarily on the basis of a multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony color. Although gene selection was appropriate for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates were genetically distinct from the C. siamense isolates. However, in our analysis, in which the *C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from all over the world, authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically. The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype, but the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium specimen GZAAS 080001 as the holotype. Specimen examined: China, Guangxi, Nanning, on Hymenocallis americana leaf spot, coll. Y.L. Yang GZAAS 080001, 19 Jun 2008 (ex-holotype culture of C. hymenocallidis − CBS 125378 = ICMP 18642).
Colletotrichum ignotum E.I Rojas, S.A. Rehner & Samuels, Mycologia 102: 1331. 2010. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum fructicola. See notes
Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences are the same as those from C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS sequences; C. kahawae subsp. kahawae has a 22 bp deletion and a single C to T transition. Collectively, the two subspecies can be distinguished from all other species using ITS sequences alone. Notes: Colletotrichum kahawae was proposed by Waller et al. (1993) as a name to refer specifically to Colletotrichum isolates causing Coffee Berry Disease (CBD), to taxonomically distinguish these disease-causing isolates from the several other Colletotrichum spp. that can be isolated from coffee plants, including C. coffeanum (see notes under C. coffeanum). Colletotrichum kahawae is an apparently clonal population (Varzea et al. 2002), widespread on coffee in Africa, and with a distinctive growth form and biology (Waller et al. 1993). In this paper, C. kahawae sensu Waller et al. (1993) is reduced to subspecies. Based on ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS gene sequences, the coffee berry pathogen cannot be distinguished from isolates from a wide range of other hosts that are not pathogenic to coffee. Those other isolates are referred to here as C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. We retain a distinct taxonomic label for the coffee berry pathogen to reflect its biosecurity importance. In addition to its biology, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae can be distinguished metabolically and genetically using GS gene sequences. Waller et al. (1993) used a metabolic test, an inability to utilize either citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source, to help characterize isolates as C. kahawae. None of our C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates were able to utilize either citrate or tartrate, whereas all of the C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates were able to utilize one or both of these carbon sources (Weir & Johnston 2009). All of the C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates share a 22 bp deletion in the glutamine synthetase gene, lacking in t
Waller et al. (1993) stated that C. kahawae was not known to form ascospores. However, Gielink and Vermeulen (1983) observed the production of perithecia on coffee berries that had been inoculated with CBD-causing isolates many months after inoculation and the death of the berries. At least one of the isolates they cited with this biology, CBS 135.30, has the GS sequence typical of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. Vermeulen et al. (1984) grew cultures from the perithecia that developed on the previously inoculated berries and found that none were pathogenic to coffee. It is possible that the perithecia developing on inoculated berries reported by Gielink and Vermeulen (1983) were from other Colletotrichum spp. present on the berries before inoculation, representing species distinct from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. A similar situation has been noted with some of our inoculations, where species present on tissues prior to inoculation, either endophytic or latent, started to sporulate on the dead tissue following inoculation (unpublished data, B.S. Weir).
Based on ITS sequences, most of the accessions in GenBank identified as C. kahawae and isolated from coffee match our concept of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. There are two exceptions: AF534468 (from Malawi) and AY376540 (STE-U 5295 = IMI 319424 = CBS 112985, from Kenya). The Kenyan isolate was cited as C. kahawae in Lubbe et al. (2004). Based on the ITS sequences and the TUB2 sequence from isolate STE-U 5295 (AY376588), these isolates represent C. siamense.
Specimens examined include: Angola, Ganada, on Coffea arabica berry, collected by J.N.M. Pedro on June 2, 1965 (IMI 310524 = CBS 982.69 = ICMP 17915); Cameroon, on Coffea arabica (IMI 361501 = ICMP 17905); Kenya, Ruiru, Kakuzi Estate, on Coffea arabica young shoots, collected by D.M. Masaba on January 29, 1987 (ex-holotype culture of C. kahawae – IMI 319418 = ICMP 17816); on Coffea sp., collected by E.C
Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa have a broad host and geographic range for the isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. Genetic identification using ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences matches those from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS sequences. Collectively, the two subspecies can be differentiated from all other species using ITS sequences alone.
Notes: The authentic isolate of G. cingulata var. migrans (CBS 237.49) differed from all other isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro due to its slower growth rate. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) distinguished Glomerella cingulata var. migrans from G. cingulata var. cingulata based on pathogenicity (G. cingulata var. migrans was pathogenic to Hypericum but not to apple) and due to its slightly longer ascospores and shorter conidia—ascospores average 21 × 4.2 µm versus 18 × 4.6 µm, while conidia average 14 × 5.2 µm versus 18 × 5 µm (Wollenweber & Hochapfel 1949). We were unable to produce ascospores from CBS 237.49, but the conidia were similar in size to those reported by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949), averaging 16.6 × 5.3 µm. The average ascospore and conidial lengths of our C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates varied within the range cited by Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) for both G. cingulata var. cingulata and G. cingulata var. migrans, with average ascospore lengths from individual isolates ranging from 16.6 to 20 µm and average conidial lengths ranging from 14.9 to 21.2 µm.
Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii was described by Shear (1907) for a fungus isolated from cranberry, morphologically identical to isolates from apple and other hosts, but appearing biologically distinct (Shear 1907, Shear & Wood 1913). A putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited by Shear in CBS in 1922, matches C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro genetically. Polashock et al. (2009) discussed the diversity of
The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex exhibits orange conidial masses visible through the mycelium, which have a pinkish-orange pigmentation on the reverse side, sometimes masked by irregular patches or sectors of dark grey pigmentation. The other variant lacks aerial mycelium, and the colony surface is covered with small, pale-based acervuli that release bright orange conidial ooze, which appears bright orange on the reverse side. Although the bright, conidial cultural type is commonly derived from single ascospores, it is rarely formed by isolates from nature (unpublished data). Similar dimorphic cultural types have been observed in single ascospore isolates from a member of the C. boninense complex, C. constrictum (unpublished data, P.R. Johnston).
Other specimens examined include: Brazil, collected by R. Barreto on Miconia sp. (RWB1054, 2009, ICMP 18728); Germany, Berlin-Dahlem, collected on Hypericum perforatum (Jun. 1937, ex-holotype culture of Glomerella cingulata var. migrans, CBS 237.49 = ICMP 17922); New Zealand, Auckland, Waitakere Ranges, on leaves of Kunzea ericoides (collections by S. Joshee, 5Kun3.10, ICMP 18741; 7Kun5.2, ICMP 18534); also collected on leaves of Toronia toru by G. Carroll (TOROTO3, ICMP 18544); in Te Puke on Persea americana fruit rot (coll. W.F.T. Hartill, 19 Jan. 1989, ICMP 18531; 8 Feb. 1988, ICMP 12952; 28 Sep. 1991, ICMP 12953); South Africa, Madeira, on Dryandra sp. (coll. J.E. Taylor, 1 Apr. 2001, CBS 112984, as C. crassipes = ICMP 17932); Switzerland, on Dryas octopetala (coll. P. Cannon, IMI 359911 = CBS 12988 = ICMP 17931); USA, on Vaccinium macrocarpum leaves (coll. C.L. Shear, Apr. 1922, authentic culture of G. rufomaculans var. vaccinii, CBS 124.22 = ICMP 19122).
Colletotrichum manihotis Henn. was first described in Hedwigia 43: 94 in 1904. Anthracnose is a significant disease affecting cassava, previously referred to by various names including Colletotrichum manihotis, Gloeosporium manihotis Henn
162 (ex-epitype culture CBS 116870). Su et al. (2011) cite several strains from Thailand that align with their concept of C. musae, and isolates from anthracnose symptoms on banana fruit from various parts of the world are consistent with our study. These isolates form a well-supported clade within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, exhibit low levels of genetic differentiation, and based on ITS sequences, are congruent with C. musae as described by Sreenivasaprasad et al. (1996), Nirenberg et al. (2002), and Shenoy et al. (2007). The morphology in culture aligns with the description provided by Sutton & Waterston (1970). We have not observed a Glomerella state in culture, and none was mentioned by Su et al. (2011). However, Rodriguez & Owen (1992) reported rare production of perithecia from crosses between two of 14 isolates identified as C. musae. It remains unknown whether the isolates studied by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) correspond genetically to our concept of C. musae, but it is plausible that this species behaves similarly to some species in the C. acutatum complex, where the sexual morph can be produced in culture under suitable conditions (Guerber & Correll 2001). The name “Glomerella musae,” used by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) and Krauss et al. (2001), has never been validly published. More than one species of Colletotrichum has been identified in association with rotting banana fruit. Among isolates with well-characterized sequence data, these include a species belonging to C. acutatum s. lat. (Sherriff et al. 1994, Johnston & Jones 1997) described as C. paxtonii (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue) and C. karstii, which belongs to the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue). The latter forms a sexual stage in culture and is documented from Musa in South America and Australia, as well as from numerous other hosts worldwide, often as an endophyte. Species in the C. boninense species complex have previously been confused with C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Greene (1967) referred to isolates pathogenic to banana that were not associated with a teleomorph as C. musae, and a second non-pathogenic species that formed fertile ascospores as C. gloeosporioides. Whether Glomerella musarum Petch, described from banana leaves and cited as the teleomorph of C. musae by Sutton (1992) and Hyde et al. (2009), is synonymous with C. musae as we define it here remains uncertain, but seems unlikely given the rare production of perithecia by this species.
Specimens examined: Indonesia, on Musa sp., collected by G. von Becze, January 1931 (CBS 192.31 = ICMP 17923). Kenya, on Musa sapientum, collected by R.M. Nattrass, January 1, 1953 (IMI 52264 = ICMP 17817). New Zealand, Auckland (imported fruit), on Musa sp., collected by P.R.

C. fructicola and C. alienum in the Musae clade are apparently host-specific species with distinctive, slow growth in culture and massive conidia (Johnson et al. 1997). Johnson et al. (1997) compare C. nupharicola with another water plant pathogen, C. nymphaeae, which is epitypified and shown to belong to the C. acutatum species complex by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue). Specimens examined include: USA, Washington, King Co., on Nuphar lutea subsp. polysepala, coll. D.A. Johnson A-7, Oct. 1993 (CBS 469.96 = ICMP 17938); Washington, Yakima Co., on N. lutea subsp. polysepala, coll. D.A. Johnson A-2, Oct. 1993 (ex-holotype culture − CBS 470.96 = ICMP 17939); Rhode Island, on Nymphaea odorata, coll. R.D. Goos RDG-291, 1979 (CBS 472.96 = ICMP 18187).
Gloeosporium pedemontanum Pupillo, Ann. Sperim. Agrar. n.s. 6: 57. 1952. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides. See notes under C. gloeosporioides. Specimen examined: Italy, on Citrus limon juice, coll. G. Goidánich, 1951 (ex holotype culture of G. pedemontanum – CBS 273.51 = ICMP 19121).
Colletotrichum psidii Curzi, Atti dell’Istituto Botanico dell’Università di Pavia, ser. 3, 3: 207. 1927. Fig. 30. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 58–63 mm in diameter after 10 days. The aerial mycelium is dense, cottony to felted, uniform in height, and white to off-white; in reverse, it is uniformly pale creamy yellow (2A2–2A3) or in some cultures becoming dull greyish yellow (2D2–2E2) towards the center. No conidiogenous cells or conidia were observed. Geographic distribution and host range: Known from a single isolate from Psidium in Italy. Genetic identification: Although known from only one isolate, ITS sequences separate C. psidii from all other taxa. Notes: A putatively authentic isolate of this species, deposited in CBS by Curzi shortly after the publication of C. psidii, represents a genetically distinct species within the Kahawae clade. The only available culture is stale and no longer forms conidia. Curzi (1927) describes the conidia as 12–15 × 3.5–4.5 µm, cylindric with rounded ends, straight or rarely slightly curved. Anthracnose diseases have bee
Sheldon (1906) produced perithecia in culture from isolates he considered typical of Gloeosporium psidii, and on this basis, recombined the species described by Delacroix (1903) in Glomerella. The relationship of G. psidii to Colletotrichum psidii, also described from guava, is not known.
Colletotrichum queenslandicum B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., nom. nov. et stat. nov. MycoBank MB563593. Fig. 31. Basionym: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minus Simmonds, Queensland J. Agric. Anim. Sci. 25: 178A. 1968. Etymology: based on the region from which the type specimen of this species was collected. Holotype: Australia, Queensland, Ormiston, on Carica papaya, coll. J.H. Simmonds, Oct. 1965, IMI 117612. Epitype: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica papaya, coll. J.H. Simmonds 11663C, Sep. 1965, epitype here designated PDD 28797; ex-epitype culture ICMP 1778.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA reached 62–74 mm in diameter after 10 days. The aerial mycelium was either dense, cottony, uniform, grey, or sometimes lacking, with numerous small acervuli having dark bases and orange conidial ooze toward the center of the colony. In reverse cultures, those with copious aerial mycelium appeared uniformly dark grey, while those with little aerial mycelium had a pinkish-brown pigment within the agar. The dark bases of the acervuli and the color of the conidial ooze were visible through the agar.
Conidia measured (12–)14.5–16.5(–21.5) × (3.5–)4.5–5(–6) µm (average 15.5 × 4.8 µm, n = 96), cylindrical, straight, sometimes slightly constricted near the center, with ends broadly rounded. Appressoria were about 6–12 µm in diameter, globose to short-cylindric, and rarely lobed. Perithecia were not observed.
Geographic distribution and host range include Carica papaya and Persea americana from Queensland, Australia, as well as from Coffea berries in Fiji. Simmonds (1965) reported that what he considered to be the same fungus was also found on Mangifera indica, Malus sylvestris, and many other hosts.
Genetic identification revealed that ITS sequences do not separate C. queenslandicum from some C. fructicola, some C. siamense, and some C. tropicale isolates. It is best distinguished from these taxa using TUB2, GAPDH, or GS.
The ex-type cultures cited by Simmonds (1968) are no longer in storage at BRIP in Queensland and are presumably lost. However, two cultures identified as C. gloeosporioides var. minus by Simmonds, isolated from the same host and locality as the holotype, had been sent to Joan Dingley in 1965 and are stored in the ICMP culture collection. The culture selected as epitype (Simmonds 11663C = ICMP 1778) matches Simmonds’ (1965) description of
However, rather than proposing a nom. nov. for Gloeosporium elasticae, he described C. gloeosporioides var. minus as a new variety, with a different type specimen. Glomerella cingulata var. minor is genetically distinct from the specimen Simmonds chose as the type of C. gloeosporioides var. minus; see notes under G. cingulata var. minor. Other specimens examined include Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica sp., collected by J.H. Simmonds 16347A2 (ICMP 1780, dried culture stored as PDD 28797); Queensland, Home Hill, on Persea americana, collected by L. Coates 22516, Feb. 1983 (ICMP 12564). In Fiji, on Coffea sp. berry, collected by R. Gounder, Apr. 1988 (ICMP 18705).
Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii Shear, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club. 34: 314. 1907. Notes: This variety is placed in synonymy with Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro. See notes under C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. Notably, Saccardo & Trotter (1913) placed Shear’s variety in Glomerella fructigena (Clint.) Sacc., a rarely used species name, which was placed in synonymy with G. cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954). The specimen examined was collected in the USA, on Vaccinium macrocarpum leaves, by C.L. Shear, Apr. 1922 (authentic isolate of G. rufomaculans var. vaccinii – CBS 124.22 = ICMP 19122).
Colletotrichum salsolae B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563589. Etymology: This name is based on C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. salsolae”, referring to the host from which this fungus was originally collected. Holotype: Hungary, on Salsola tragus, collected by D. Berner [specimen from plants inoculated with strain 96-067, originally collected by I. Schwarczinger & L. Vajna on Salsola tragus from Bugac, near Kiskunsag National Park, 1996], BPI 878740; ex-holotype culture ICMP 19051. Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 38–42 mm in diameter after 10 days, with sparse, cottony, pale grey aerial mycelium. The surface of the colony is dark, displaying a more or less continuous layer of acervulus-like structures with deep orange-brown conidial masses and numerous setae. The reverse side shows dark purplish-black near the center and dark olivaceous near the margin. Conidia measure (
Isolates of C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Salsola tragus were reported by Schwarczinger et al. (1998) and referred to as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. salsolae” by Berner et al. (2009). Although mildly pathogenic to a wide range of hosts in glasshouse pathogenicity tests, this fungus causes severe disease only on Salsola spp., with the exception of S. orientalis, S. soda, and S. vermiculata (Berner et al. 2009). Colletotrichum salsolae belongs to the Musae clade, and although genetically close to several other species, it is biologically and morphologically distinctive.
Other specimens examined include an additional isolate of strain selected as the holotype, recovered from inoculated Glycine max plants (MCA 2498 = CBS 119296 = ICMP 18693). Colletotrichum siamense Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde was originally described from coffee in Thailand but is biologically and geographically diverse, found on many hosts across several tropical and subtropical regions. Genetic identification of C. siamense is complicated, as ITS sequences do not reliably separate it from C. alienum, C. fructicola, or C. tropicale. These species are best distinguished using CAL or TUB2.
Notes from Yang et al. (2009) and Wikee et al. (2011) discuss genetic and morphological differences between C. siamense, C. jasmini-sambac, and C. hymenocallidis. However, both studies used a limited set of isolates within the C. gloeosporioides complex, making interpretation of genetic differences difficult. The morphological differences they described are commonly seen as within-species variation in other Colletotrichum spp. In our analysis, C. siamense is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts across several tropical regions and forms a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided genetically. Variation in cultural appearance is broad, likely reflecting different storage conditions of the isolates. The shape and size of appressoria, along with the characteristically small conidia, are similar in all isolates.
Based on matching translation elongation factor (TEF) and TUB2 sequences, isolates referred to by Rojas et al. (2010) as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2 also represent C. siamense. Note that TEF data was excluded from our phylogenetic analyses because the TEF gene tree was often incongruent with the trees from the other genes we sequenced. For

The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex is known for its specificity to certain hosts. Munaut et al. (2002) distinguished C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis from isolates they identified as C. gloeosporioides f. gloeosporioides due to two additional cytosines at positions 93 and 94 in the ITS1 region, resulting in a sequence of seven cytosines at this position. This distinctive feature of the ITS1 is also found in the ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola, the ex-epitype isolate of C. fragariae, and all other isolates of C. theobromicola, though some isolates possess three additional cytosines instead of two. None of the other isolates sampled from the C. gloeosporioides species complex exhibited this unique string of cytosines. Rojas et al. (2010) provided a description for their interpretation of C. theobromicola, while MacKenzie et al. (2008) described C. fragariae, and Irwin & Cameron (1978) characterized C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis” (as C. gloeosporioides Type A) and C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis” (as C. gloeosporioides Type B).
In terms of cultural appearance, the isolates accepted within this species exhibit variability, ranging from the very dark ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola to the slow-growing, pale-colored C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis.” None of the examined isolates formed perithecia in culture. All had conidia that tapered slightly towards each end, with a more pronounced tapering at the base, aligning with the description of C. fragariae by Gunnell & Gubler (1992), who considered the conidial shape distinctive for the species. Some isolates studied by Gunnell & Gubler (1992) were included in MacKenzie et al.'s (2008) research, and their genetic concept of C. fragariae aligns with ours.
Specimens examined include several collections from Australia, such as Stylosanthes viscosa in Queensland (ex-holotype culture of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis), various collections of Olea europaea fruit in New South Wales, and Limonium sp. leaf lesions in Israel. Other specimens were collected from Mexico, New Zealand, Panama, and the USA, with specific host details for each collection.

Leaf spots are oblong to elliptic in shape, measuring up to about 1 × 2 mm, and sometimes coalescing when close together on a leaf. They appear pale grey and necrotic in the center, surrounded by a reddish margin. Acervuli are numerous, with a base that ranges from pale to dark grey, featuring scattered dark brown setae approximately 50–80 µm long. Perithecia were not observed on infected leaves. Freshly isolated colonies on Difco PDA reach 50–55 mm in diameter after 10 days, exhibiting a slightly irregular and feathery margin. Aerial mycelium is lacking in the ex-holotype culture, but when present, it is fine, cottony, and pale grey, with the colony surface darkening toward the center and appearing pale pinkish orange towards the margin. Conidia form over all parts of the culture, mostly not associated with well-differentiated acervuli, and setae are not observed. The reverse shows a purple coloration near the center and orange outside, sometimes featuring concentric rings of grey pigment.
Conidiogenous cells are cylindrical, measuring mostly 15–25 × 3.5–4.5 µm. Toward the center of the colony, they are arranged in closely packed palisades, while at the margin, conidiophores exhibit a looser structure, irregularly branched, with conidiogenous loci at the apex and often also at the septa. Conidia measure (11.5–) 14–17.5(–23.5) × (4–)5–5.5(–7.5) µm (average 16 × 5.2 µm, n = 53),

Colletotrichum tropicale E.I. Rojas, S.A. Rehner & Samuels, Mycologia 102: 1331. 2010. Rojas et al. (2010) provide a description. Geographic distribution and host range: Rojas et al. (2010) noted that C. tropicale has been isolated from a wide range of hosts in forests in tropical America, from rotting fruit as well as leaf endophytes. We also include an isolate from tropical Japan, from Litchi chinensis leaves. Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not separate C. tropicale from some C. siamense or some C. queenslandicum isolates. Colletotrichum tropicale is best distinguished using TUB2, CHS-1, GS, or SOD2. Notes: Colletotrichum tropicale is genetically close to C. siamense, and the two species share a number of morphological features; slow growth in culture, short and broad conidia with broadly rounded ends and often slightly constricted near the center, and simple appressoria.
Weir et al. illustrate Colletotrichum ti with three cultures: A. ICMP 19444, B. ICMP 4832 – ex-holotype culture, and C. ICMP 5285. Cultures were grown on PDA for 10 days from single conidia, showing growth from above and below. For Colletotrichum tropicale, cultures A. ICMP 18653 (ex CBS 124949 – ex-holotype culture), B. ICMP 18651 (ex CBS 124943), and C. ICMP 18672 (ex MAFF 239933) were also grown on PDA for 10 days from single conidia, with growth observed from both above and below.

All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also be a problem. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts around the name C. gloeosporioides makes this a particular problem. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, which shows that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.
The species we accept are based on a phylogenetic species concept, with all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal clades are recognized as named species. In most cases, any well-supported within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the multi-gene phylogeny is not resolved consistently in all gene trees. This lack of congruence between gene trees signals that the diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although the concatenation of gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it masks discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach, combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesized to represent a single species, so that the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates is estimated. The results of such an analysis for the C. gloeosporioides complex are illustrated, showing relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades, respectively, at an expanded scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae cla
However, even with these potentially more informative genes, the low levels of genetic divergence across the C. gloeosporioides complex may always provide a technical challenge. The low level of diversity within this species complex is reflected by the branch lengths in the related studies, especially across the Musae clade, where the average pairwise identity between all isolates treated in our five-gene alignment is 98.6%. Pairwise identity between isolates of C. siamense and C. theobromicola, two species showing strong within-species phylogenetic structure, are 99.4% and 99.6%, respectively. This suggests that the species recognized within the C. gloeosporioides complex are very recently evolved, and further data supports this. The hypothesis of recent evolution of host-specialized Colletotrichum populations from more generalist fungi was also invoked in relation to the C. acutatum complex, using the “episodic selection” framework. Several of the accepted species contain isolates with divergent lifestyles, for example, C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae, and C. theobromicola. Each of these species includes isolates capable of causing specific diseases. In the case of C. kahawae, recent pathogenicity tests have shown that only some isolates are able to cause coffee berry disease, and these isolates can be distinguished using genetic sequences and markers. Because of the well-understood pathogenicity of isolates within C. kahawae, the biosecurity importance of coffee berry disease, and the ability to distinguish the disease-causing isolates using carefully selected genetic markers, we recognize the disease-causing isolates taxonomically at the subspecific level. Future studies of the comparative pathogenicity of isolates within C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, and C. theobromicola may reveal genetically distinct, host-specialized pathogenic populations within these species that future researchers may also choose to recognize taxonomically. The classification we accept here is deliberately taxonomically conservative, minimizing nomenclatural changes. This reflects continuing uncertainty about sensible species limits within the C. gloeosporioides complex, which relate to low levels of genetic divergence, gene selection, isolate selection, and a lack of understanding of the mechanisms driving species and population divergence among these fungi. For example, the two haplotype subgroups of C. fructicola are not distinguished taxonomically because collectively they form a monophyletic clade, both subgroups include sets of isolates with similar geographic and host diversity, and there is no practical need to distinguish them taxonomically.
Molecular tools are increasingly being used for day-to-day identification by biosecurity officers and plant pathology researchers, highlighting the need for a taxonomy that closely reflects groups resolved genetically, as well as simple and reliable protocols for identifying those taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene. Although ITS is useful at the species complex level, it performs poorly at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 of the 22 accepted species. This reflects the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the C. gloeosporioides complex; species are often distinguished by only one or two base changes. In some cases, chance variation in the ITS sequence within or between species means that some species cannot be distinguished. Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti, and some C. siamense isolates; C. fructicola and some C. siamense isolates; and C. alienum, C. aenigma, and some C. siamense isolates.
Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than ITS, and the need for secondary barcodes based on these types of genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi. Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode to achieve accurate species identification within the C. gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the genes' performance as barcodes was conducted as part of a previous study, with GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performing well, while CHS 1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) performed poorly. However, that analysis included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the single genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to differentiate C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest gene to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are required to differentiate C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic.
In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are the best for genetic identifications, and these are summarized for all species and genes. For species represented by a single or few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recom
However, our experience is that such groups often break down when the geographic sample within a clade is extended to a global scale. Many of the species we accept have few or no diagnostic morphological or cultural features that can be consistently and reliably used to identify them. Our morphological examinations were confined to cultures on Difco PDA agar plates, and we will have missed any features that develop solely in association with plant material. In addition, the cultures we used have been sourced from different labs and collections around the world, many with no information on storage history. Storage history and method have a major impact on the appearance of Colletotrichum in culture. Cultures can become “stale” during storage, losing the ability to produce pigments; the aerial mycelium often becomes very dense and felted, and they lose the ability to form well-differentiated acervuli, conidia, or perithecia. In some clades, even freshly isolated cultures are highly variable, forming distinct sectors with differences in the production of pigment, aerial mycelium, acervuli, and conidia. Some isolates form two very different cultural types from single conidia or ascospores derived from colonies started from single ascospores. One culture from an isolate of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro has the typical appearance of cultures of this fungus isolated from the field. The other, with a uniform, dense layer of conidia across the colony surface without well-differentiated acervuli and minimal aerial mycelium, is common from single ascospore isolates in culture but rarely found in cultures isolated directly from the field. This kind of variation, along with that revealed from sectoring during colony growth, makes morphological variation difficult to interpret for accurate identification. Many of the species recognized in this work remain poorly understood in terms of their pathogenicity and host preference. This reflects, in part, a lack of certainty about the biological relationship between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, such as the C. salicis example discussed by Johnston (2000, as Glomerella miyabeana). The multiple Colletotrichum spp. associated with a single host are likely to have a variety of lifestyles: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and fruit only following senescence of the host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only after host tissue death. The combination of this range of distinct lifestyles, the fact that several Colletotrichum spp. may become established on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts has contributed to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum. In some cases, apparently clear differences in the pathogenicity of isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex are not reflected genetically. For example, the fungi referred to as C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f.
Originally described as a pathogen of green coffee berries, almost genetically identical isolates have subsequently been found on a wide range of hosts. The isolates from other hosts are not pathogenic to coffee berries. The difference in pathogenicity correlates with a genetic difference in the GS gene, and we taxonomically recognize this biologically specialized population at the subspecies level. A similar approach could potentially be taken for other biologically distinct populations within a genetically strongly supported species. Despite the epitypification of C. gloeosporioides in 2008, many authors will continue to use the name in the sense of the C. gloeosporioides species complex, presumably regarding this level of identification as sufficient for their research. All of the isolates that we accept in the C. gloeosporioides complex share the string 5’–GGGCGGGT–3’ about 139–142 bases after the ITS1F primer binding site. Based on a comparison with GenBank data, this string appears to be specific to isolates that we would accept as members of the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Several authors have developed PCR-based, rapid identification tools for distinguishing members of the C. gloeosporioides complex from members of the C. acutatum species complex. This has been prompted because some members of the C. acutatum complex have conidia without the acute ends characteristic of this species and have at times been confused with C. gloeosporioides. Primers reportedly specific to C. gloeosporioides include the CgInt primer for ITS. In our dataset, this primer sequence is found in C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. fructicola, and C. siamense, but all of the other taxa that we recognize within the C. gloeosporioides complex have one or more bases not matching the CgInt primer. The practical impact of these differences will depend in part on the position of the mismatch and stringency of the PCR reaction.
Talhinas et al. discussed the TBCG primer for β-tubulin, and this is found within all of our taxa within the C. gloeosporioides group except C. musae and C. asianum. Liu et al. describe characteristic RFLP bands from glutamine synthetase using the restriction enzyme Pst1. Based on our sequences, this method will generate the characteristic C. gloeosporioides bands reported for C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. asianum, C. clidemiae, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. horii, C. queenslandicum, C. salsolae, C. siamense, C. ti, and C. tropicale. Different banding patterns will be produced by C. aeschynomenes, the two C. kahawae subspecies, G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae,” and C. musae, but none match the bands reported for C. acutatum.
In terms of species identification within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, various genes show differing

The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex comparison of our data with gene sequences reported as C. gloeosporioides in recent papers allows most to be placed with confidence in one of the species that we accept. There are exceptions, such as the pecan-associated isolates from Liu et al. (2011) and the pistachio-associated isolates reported by Yang et al. (2011), both of which appear to represent undescribed species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Clearly, more species remain to be described within this complex. Additionally, taxonomic issues still need to be resolved among the species discussed in this paper, including the relationship between G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” and C. camelliae, the identity of the cotton pathogens referred to as C. gossypii, the identity of the cassava pathogens referred to as C. manihotis, the relationship between C. aeschynomenes and C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae,” whether the various yam diseases discussed in the literature are all caused by C. alatae, and whether the isolates of C. aotearoa from Meryta leaf spots form a biologically distinct population. A more general question relates to better understanding the frequency of hybrids within the C. gloeosporioides complex and the impact of this on the interpretation of the phylogenies within the complex. The impact of hybridization on the evolution of disease-specialized populations has barely been explored.
