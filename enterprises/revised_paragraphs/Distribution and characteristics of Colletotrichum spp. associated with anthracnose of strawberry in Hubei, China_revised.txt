Abstract
Han, Y. C., Zeng, X. G., Xiang, F. Y., Ren, L., Chen, F. Y., and Gu, Y. C. 2016. Distribution and characteristics of Colletotrichum spp. associated with anthracnose of strawberry in Hubei, China. Plant Dis. 100:996-1006. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious disease of strawberry. The etiology of anthracnose of strawberry is complex, and several Colletotrichum spp. have been regarded as causal agents. In the present study, multilocus phylogenetic analysis revealed that 100 isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of strawberry in central China belong to five species. A total of 97 isolates were identified as part of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, with C. murrayae, C. gloeosporioides, C. fructicola, and C. aenigma accounting for 81%, 8%, 4%, and 4% of the total isolates, respectively. Three isolates belonging to the C. acutatum complex were identified as C. nymphaeae. On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae showed strong pathogenicity to both leaves and petioles, resulting in plant mortality of 77.8% and 55.6%, respectively, 30 days after inoculation. C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. nymphaeae exhibited strong pathogenicity to leaves but weak pathogenicity to petioles, with plant mortality of 5.6%, 16.7%, and 11.1%, respectively, 30 days after inoculation. The five species were divided into four classes based on their maximum growth temperatures. Isolates of C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides were more tolerant to high temperatures (>34°C) than isolates of other species, followed by C. fructicola and C. aenigma. Isolates of C. nymphaeae, found only in areas of higher altitude (1,100 m), were highly sensitive to elevated temperatures. These results indicate that pathogenicity and temperature adaptation are crucial factors in the distribution of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberry plants. This research may enhance our understanding of how Colletotrichum spp. emerge and spread across geographical regions with different latitudes or elevations.
Strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) is a small fruit crop of global importance. The area used for strawberry cultivation in China has increased rapidly in recent years. Anthracnose can cause considerable yield losses under suitable environmental conditions. Strawberry infected with Colletotrichum spp. may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially leading to the collapse and death of the plant. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms later appear as irregular and black lea
Anthracnose disease, caused by Colletotrichum spp., affects a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees. The genus was recently identified as the world’s eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi, based on perceived scientific and economic importance. However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has long been problematic. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have not been successful in delineating species. Researchers have noted the need to resurvey plant pathogens such as Colletotrichum spp. using molecular approaches, as previous data based on morphology and internal transcribed spacer sequences are likely incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has been significantly improved with the use of multilocus phylogenetic analysis on species complexes, as well as the epitypification of many important pathogenic species. An important contribution to the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes was made by various researchers. A review of species identification revealed that the C. gloeosporioides complex consists of 34 taxa, while the C. acutatum complex currently comprises at least 31 taxa. Hitherto, little was known about the species and distribution of Colletotrichum associated with strawberry anthracnose in China. The first objective of this study was to identify and characterize the species associated with strawberry anthracnose in central China based on morphological, molecular, and pathogenic characteristics. The second objective was to analyze the distribution of Colletotrichum spp. based on a large number of isolates.
Material and Methods
Fungal isolate collections. Hubei Province, located in the central region of the Yangtze River, has a warm, humid, subtropical climate. From 2012 to 2014, plants exhibiting stunting, chlorosis, and root necrosis were collected from nurseries and production fields in central China. Thirteen locations were sampled from different geographical regions in central China. The altitudes of the sampling locations were determined by GPS positioning. Most areas of Hubei Province are plains with an elevation of no more than 100 m. The 10-day average temperatures from 2012 to 2013 in Wuhan and Lichuan were provided by the meteorological service center of Hubei Province. The 10-day average temperature in Wuhan from July to September was 20.7 to 32.4°C in 2012 and 2013. Enshi is a mountainous area to the west of Hubei Province, with the elevation of the sampling location in Enshi approximately 1,100 m. The 10-day average temperature from July to September in Lichuan was 16.1 to 25.2°C in 2012 and 2013.
Fungi were isolated from diseased tissues such as petioles, stolons, leaf lesions, or diseased crowns of infected strawberry plants. The diseased plant tissues were surface disinfected in 70% ethanol for 10 seconds and 1% NaClO for 3 minutes, then rinsed three times with sterile distilled water and finally dried with sterilized tissue paper. The samples were cut into 5-by-5 mm pieces and plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) acidified with lactic acid at a final concentration of 0.05% to inhibit bacterial growth. The isolation plates were incubated under continuous fluorescent light in an incubator at 28°C for 3 to 7 days. The growing edges of any fungal hyphae developing on the PDA plates were then transferred aseptically to new PDA plates. The initial identification was based on the colony morphology on PDA plates. Single-spore subcultures were obtained for Colletotrichum isolates, and isolates without conidia on the PDA plates were purified by transferring samples from the edge of each colony to new PDA plates three to five times. In total, 100 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from typical anthracnose lesions from strawberry petioles, stolons, and leaves. Of these, 98 isolates were from Hubei Province and 2 isolates (Nj-2 and Nj-122) were obtained from Jiangsu Province in October. All isolates were stored at 10°C for about 1 to 2 weeks before DNA extraction.
To obtain mycelia from Colletotrichum spp., a 5-mm-diameter plug from the growing margin of a 5-day-old colony was inoculated in the center of an autoclaved cellophane membrane placed on PDA (pH 7.0) in a petri dish (90 mm in diameter). The dish was incubated at 28°C for 4 days. The mycelia of each isolate in the dish were collected using an autoclaved spatula and stored at −20°C until use. The mycelia of each isolate were ground to a fine powder in liquid nitrogen with a mortar and pestle. Genomic DNA (gDNA) was extracted and purified as described elsewhere. DNA samples from each isolate were stored at −20°C until use.
Partial sequences corresponding to actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) were amplified from gDNA from the indicated Colletotrichum isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR). ACT and TUB2 were amplified using the primer pairs ACT512F and ACT-R2, and T1 and Tub2-R2, respectively. CAL, GPDH, and CHS-1 were amplified using the primer pairs CL1C and CL2C, GDF2 and GDR3, and CHS-88F and CHS-834R, respectively. Primers of Act-R2, TUB-R2, GDR3, and CHS-834R were designed downstream of the binding site of standard primers at these loci. All new primers designed in this study from the conserved domain in the corresponding genes in C. crassipes, C. graminicola, and C. gloeosporioides provided more specific amplification for species in this study. The primers were used for PCR and PCR product sequencing unidirectionally, as this was more conven
PCR was performed in a thermal cycler. The cycling parameters for GPDH consisted of a denaturation step at 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 65°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, and a final cycle at 72°C for 10 minutes. The cycling parameters for CAL were 94°C for 5 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 1 minute, 55°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 2 minutes, with a final step at 72°C for 10 minutes. The cycling parameters for the ACT, TUB2, and CHS-1 regions consisted of a 5-minute denaturation step at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 94°C for 30 seconds, 59°C for 30 seconds, and 72°C for 1 minute, with a final cycle of 10 minutes at 72°C. A 5-ml aliquot of each PCR was separated by electrophoresis in a 1.5% agarose gel in 1.0× Tris-acetate EDTA buffer and photographed under UV light after staining with Gel Red for 30 minutes. PCR products containing the target band were purified using a cleanup kit according to the manufacturer’s instructions, then individually sequenced via the dideoxynucleotide termination method using a sequencing kit. All sequences were divided into 25 groups by genes and species, based on the results of preliminary phylogenetic analyses, and were aligned with software. Sequences with single-nucleotide polymorphisms were amplified and sequenced a total of three times to ensure that polymorphisms were not due to sequencing errors.
The partial DNA sequences of ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GPDH, and TUB2 for all isolates, except Lch-5, Lch-9-1, and Lch-13, represented 997 isolates of recognized species within the C. gloeosporioides complex and isolate CBS123755 of C. boninense, which were used to establish a five-locus combined dataset (ACT + CAL + CHS-1 + GPDH + TUB2) in the first Bayesian inference analysis. C. boninense was used as an outgroup. The sequence of CAL was missing for several representative isolates within the C. acutatum species complex. Therefore, partial DNA sequences of ACT, CHS-1, GADH, and TUB2 for isolates Lch-5, Lch-9-1, and Lch-13, and for 31 representative isolates, were used to establish a four-locus combined dataset (ACT + CHS-1 + GPDH + TUB2) in the second Bayesian inference analysis, with C. pseudoacutatum used as an outgroup. Multiple sequence alignments
ClustalW, as implemented in MEGA v.5 (Tamura et al. 2011), was used to generate alignments for the genes in this study. The sequences were manually truncated to align with the reference sequences of the type isolates for constructing phylogenetic trees. Bayesian inference was employed to reconstruct the phylogenetic trees using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al. 2012). The best-fit models of nucleotide substitution for ACT are summarized in the study.
The study utilized various strains of the Colletotrichum species, which were collected from different localities in Hubei, China. The strains included C. aenigma and C. fructicola, among others, with samples taken from various substrates such as leaves, stolons, and crowns. Each strain is associated with a specific GenBank accession number and was collected on a particular date. The data provide a comprehensive overview of the strains analyzed, highlighting their geographic and biological diversity.

In the study, conidial suspensions of each species were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses on PDA. The shape and color of the conidia were observed, and the size of 50 conidia per isolate was measured using a microscope. A total of 21 isolates from five species were evaluated to determine the effect of temperature on radial colony growth. All isolates were maintained on PDA supplemented with lactic acid at 28°C for 5 days. Plugs of agar with a diameter of 5 mm were cut from the leading edge of colonies and placed in the center of petri plates containing PDA. The plates were wrapped with parafilm and incubated at various temperatures ranging from 6°C to 42°C in the dark. After 4 days, colony diameters were measured to calculate the mycelial growth rate. The experiment was designed as a randomized complete block with three replicates for each temperature treatment and was repeated once.
For pathogenicity assays, not all Co
Santos García de Paredes and Romero Muñoz (2002) observed that the cultures sporulated profusely after 7 to 10 days. Plates were flooded with sterile distilled water, and the spore suspension was passed through cheesecloth to remove dislodged mycelia (Mangandi et al. 2015). The suspension was then adjusted to 2 × 10^6 conidia/ml. Healthy 6-week-old strawberry plants (‘Benihopp’) that had not been exposed to fungicides were used for plant inoculation experiments. The plants were inoculated by spraying conidial suspensions (2 × 10^6 conidia/ml) of five isolates (Nj-2, Jsh-7-1, Lch-39-2, Lbwuh-4-2, and Lch-5) until runoff (Freeman and Katan 1997). Negative control plants received sterile water without conidia. Nine plants were inoculated with each isolate separately and were maintained in a moisture chamber at 25 to 35°C for 48 hours, then transferred to a greenhouse at the same temperature for 30 days under natural daylight conditions.
The pathogenicity of different species to strawberry was evaluated by calculating the disease index (DI) based on the symptoms severity (SS) of leaves and petioles. The SS class of leaves, calculated based on the percentage of infected leaf surface caused by Colletotrichum spp., was described on a six-point scale: 0 = healthy leaves with no lesions, 1 = 0.1 to 5.0% infected, 3 = 5.1 to 15.0%, 5 = 15.1 to 30.0%, 7 = 30.1 to 50.0%, and 9 = 50.1 to 100% infected leaf surface or dead leaves. The SS class of petioles, based on the length of lesions caused by Colletotrichum spp. on petioles, was similarly described: 0 = healthy petiole with no lesions, 1 = lesions of 0.1 to 2 mm, 3 = 2.1 to 5.0 mm, 5 = 5.1 to 9.0 mm, 7 = 9.1 to 15.0 mm, and 9 = greater than 15.0 mm in length or wilting leaves (Wang et al. 2008). All leaves and petioles on each plant were evaluated individually. The number of leaves or petioles in each SS class was recorded 20 days after inoculation (dai), and plant mortality was recorded 30 dai. These experiments were conducted twice.
SS were converted to DI using the formula from Horiuchi and Hori (1980): DI = [(n0 × 0 + n1 × 1 + n3 × 3 + n5 × 5 + n7 × 7 + n9 × 9)/9N] × 100, where n is the number of leaves or petioles in this SS class; the subscripts 0, 1, 3, 5, 7
The Bayesian inference with the haplotypes belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex was performed with the combined TUB2, ACT, CAL, GPDH, and CHS-1 sequences, comprising 2,352 characters after alignment. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: TUB2, 1 to 733; ACT, 734 to 1,028; CAL, 1,029 to 1,776; GPDH, 1,777 to 2,081; and CHS-1, 2,082 to 2,352. The Bayesian inference with the haplotypes belonging to the C. acutatum species complex was performed with the combined TUB2, ACT, GPDH, and CHS-1 sequences, comprising 1,265 characters after alignment. The boundaries of the loci used in the alignment were as follows: TUB2, 1 to 495; ACT, 496 to 745; GPDH, 746 to 1,015; CHS-1, 1,016 to 1,265. The isolates from strawberry belonged to five clades. In the Bayesian inference for the C. gloeosporioides complex, 81 isolates clustered with C. murrayae, 8 isolates clustered with C. gloeosporioides, 4 isolates clustered with C. fructicola, and 4 isolates clustered with C. aenigma. In the Bayesian inference for the C. acutatum complex, three isolates clustered with C. nymphaeae. C. murrayae was the most frequently isolated species, comprising 81% of all isolates, followed by C. gloeosporioides at 7%. Isolates of C. murrayae were widely distributed in Hubei Province, while C. gloeosporioides was primarily distributed in Wuhan, Xiangyang, Yichang, and Enshi. C. fructicola was mainly distributed in Xiangyang, Jingzhou, and Enshi. All four isolates of C. aenigma were isolated from Wuhan, and C. nymphaeae was distributed in Enshi. The altitudes of the sampling locations were no higher than 100 m, with the exception of Enshi (1,100 m).
Regarding morphological and cultural characterization, few differences in colony morphology were observed among the five species when grown on PDA. All selected isolates developed white colonies that became gray after 10 days. Isolates of C. nymphaeae and C. gloeosporioides produced numerous conidia on PDA, while isolates of the other three species produced fewer conidia. The conidia produced by C. nymphaeae were sharp at both ends, which was different from that of the other four species in this study.
The optimum temperature for all five Colletotrichum species in the current study was 28°C, but the tolerance to high temperature (34°C) varied among species. The five species were divided into four groups based on their maximum growth temperatures. Isolates of C. nymphaeae, isolated only in Enshi, were sensitive to high temperatures, with an average growth rate of 0.11 mm/day at 34
Pathogenicity assays indicated that all isolates of Colletotrichum tested were pathogenic to non-wounded strawberry leaves and petioles. Symptoms first appeared on the leaves. Infected leaves developed sunken, prominent, dark-brown to black decay, along with necrotic lesions. Typical orange conidial masses were often observed on leaves 7 to 10 days after inoculation (dai). Symptoms of anthracnose were not observed on petioles at 10 dai. By 20 dai, symptoms appeared on both leaves and petioles of strawberry. Disease severity caused by the five species showed significant differences. Isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity on both leaves and petioles of strawberry. Plant mortalities caused by C. fructicola and C. murrayae at 30 dai were 77.8% and 55.6%, respectively. In contrast, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. nymphaeae demonstrated strong pathogenicity to leaves but weak pathogenicity to petioles. Plant mortalities caused by these species at 30 dai were 5.6%, 16.7%, and 11.1%, respectively, compared with 0% for the water control plants.
This study represents the first attempt to characterize Colletotrichum spp. associated with anthracnose of strawberry in China using a polyphasic approach. GPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and TUB2 loci were employed in the phylogenetic analysis. The analysis revealed that the 100 Colletotrichum isolates from strawberry plants belonged to five species. This study provides the first report of C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, C. murrayae, C. fructicola, and C. nymphaeae from strawberry in China, while C. fructicola and C. nymphaeae have been previously recorded from strawberry. Together with the nine species in the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes, twelve Colletotrichum spp. are now known to be associated with strawberry hosts. C. gloeosporioides, recognized as a pathogen of strawberry, is actually a species complex. C. gloeosporioides was typified by Cannon et al., and a recent study indicated this species was associated with the genera Citrus, Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis. These results align with previous reports that the C. gloeosporioides species complex is the most prevalent agent of strawberry anthracnose in China, while the C. acutatum species complex only occasionally causes anthracnose. C. theobromicola, synonymous with C. fragariae, has been reported to infect strawberry plants, but no isolates of this species were identified in this study. Important progress on the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes has been made, but the biological characteristics such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum spp. remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Temperature is a major factor affecting the epidemics of plant disease; it can influence spore germination and infection, latent period, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to many pathogens. High temperatures and their frequency can delay or prevent plant disease, while pathogen adaptation to temperature is crucial for disease emergence.
E, C. nymphaeae. Cultures on potato dextrose agar, growth at 18°C for 10 days from mycelial discs (5 mm in diameter) show 1, aerial view and 2, reverse view; 3, symptoms caused by Colletotrichum spp. on strawberry 30 days after spray inoculation with conidia.
Botrytis fruit rot of strawberry caused by Botrytis cinerea occurs mainly at low temperatures in winter and spring; however, Colletotrichum spp. require relatively hot temperatures and mainly cause anthracnose of strawberry in summer. The minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures are important biological characteristics and widely used to characterize microorganisms. In this study, no significant differences were observed in the minimum and optimum growth temperatures of the five Colletotrichum spp., but the maximum growth temperatures were different. The five Colletotrichum spp. were grouped into four classes based on their maximum growth temperatures.
C. murrayae was originally reported from Citrus leaves in China. It is tolerant to high temperatures and shows strong pathogenicity to strawberry plants. C. murrayae was the most frequently isolated species, distributed in nearly all sampling areas, and seems to be the most economically important species in strawberry nurseries in Hubei, China. C. gloeosporioides was also tolerant to high temperatures but was weakly pathogenic to strawberry plants, being the second most prevalent species, with 8% of all isolates. C. fructicola was originally reported as causing coffee berry disease in Thailand. Although C. fructicola showed stronger pathogenicity to strawberry plants than the other four species in this study, it exhibited less tolerance to high temperatures than C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides and occurred only sporadically. C. aenigma was first described by Weir et al. and causes anthracnose of Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and Persea americana in Israel. C. nymphaeae was originally described in detail in morphological and pathological terms. Both C. aenigma and C. nymphaeae showed weak pathogenicity to strawberry plants and were less tolerant to high temperatures than C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides. These species occurred very sporadically in Hubei, China.
Current data revealed that each species possesses a stable and distinguishable maximum growth temperature, which may be used for distinguishing Colletotrichum spp., particularly morphologically similar species. The frequencies and distribution of these five species are related to differences in high temperature tolerance and pathogenicity. This research may increase our understanding of how Colletotrichum spp. emerge and spread to geographical regions with different latitudes or elevations. Due to climate change, pathogens are exposed to increasingly warmer environments, and the impact of anthropogenic climate change on terrestrial organisms is often predicted to increase with latitude and elevation. This research is also important for predicting changes that may occur due to global warming conditions. Further studies should be conducted on the host range, distribution, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. at different temperatures.
Conidia of five Colletotrichum spp. from strawberry are as follo

Table 3 summarizes the morphological data of various Colletotrichum isolates. It presents details on conidia characteristics across different species, including their average length and width, as well as their shapes. The conidia of Colletotrichum murrayae measure an average length of 14.3 mm and a width of 3.8 mm, both rounded in shape. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has similar conidia length at 14.4 mm but a wider measurement of 5.1 mm. Colletotrichum fructicola shows slightly shorter conidia with an average length of 14.0 mm and width of 4.8 mm, maintaining a rounded shape. Colletotrichum aenigma mirrors this length at 14.4 mm but has a narrower width of 4.1 mm. Colletotrichum nymphaeae, in contrast, presents a pointed shape with an average length of 11.2 mm and width of 3.9 mm.

C. fructicola (four isolates), C. aenigma (four isolates), and C. nymphaeae (three isolates) were cultured on potato dextrose agar in the dark at different temperatures for 4 days. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum isolates on strawberry was assessed by evaluating the disease index and plant mortality. Colletotrichum murrayae showed a foliar disease index of 70.0 and a petiole index of 38.6, with a mortality rate of 55.6%. C. gloeosporioides had a foliar index of 57.7, a petiole index of 4.7, and a mortality rate of 5.6%. C. fructicola had the highest indices, with a foliar index of 78.5, a petiole index of 42.4, and a mortality rate of 77.8%. C. aenigma and C. nymphaeae had lower indices, with mortality rates of 16.7% and 11.1%, respectively. The least significant difference (LSD) for the disease indices were 24.8 for foliar, 32.0 for petiole, and 9.0 for mortality. The disease index was evaluated 20 days after inoculation, while plant mortality was evaluated 30 days after inoculation, based on the mean percent mortality of strawberry with conidial suspension of Colletotrichum species by spray methods.
