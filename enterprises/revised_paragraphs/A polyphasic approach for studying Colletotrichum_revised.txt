Introduction
The Need for Species Recognition
Colletotrichum Corda is one of the most economically important genera of fungi, responsible for anthracnose and other diseases affecting a wide range of plant species. The importance of a rigid and stable taxonomy for determining Colletotrichum species is a significant practical concern. However, there has been considerable difficulty surrounding Colletotrichum systematics due to the lack of reliable morphological features, which makes species boundaries ambiguous and confusing. Traditionally, many Colletotrichum species have been named after their hosts, suggesting host specificity among species. In a significant move, von Arx reduced the number of Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Since then, several additional species have been accepted based on morphological criteria.
The difficulty in recognizing Colletotrichum species arises from: 1) few and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity; 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unusable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains that are often erroneously named. To address the issue of few morphologically informative characters, researchers have utilized other data such as nucleic acid sequences, physiology, secondary metabolites, and pathogenicity as part of a polyphasic approach. Phylogenetic analysis based on nucleic acid sequences has successfully differentiated species in other challenging genera or groups, although it has been less successful in others. Such data is especially important for species differentiation and understanding the relationships among Colletotrichum species.
One potential solution for inadequate type material is to designate an epitype for the species. This stabilizes the species name and should provide sequence data as well as living specimens for future research. Thirteen species of Colletotrichum have been epitypified and/or newly combined in the genus, while recently described new species have ex-type cultures. The use of sequences from type specimens is essential when diagnosing Colletotrichum species or studying their phylogenetic relationships. Where possible, all previously designated C. gloeosporioides strains should be compared against the recently designated epitype of *
Colletotrichum taxonomy is presently unsatisfactory, and there is a pressing need for a polyphasic approach to identification that reflects the natural classification of species and subspecific taxa within the genus. This paper proposes a taxonomic framework for describing Colletotrichum epitypes and new species. It utilizes a multi-gene phylogeny based on type specimens and well-defined phylogenetic lineages that correlate with recognizable polyphasic characters such as morphology, cultural characteristics, physiology, and pathogenicity. The various approaches that have been used or could be incorporated in the study of Colletotrichum species, along with recommended methodologies and a discussion on the correlation of characters with phylogenetic types, are examined. A phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene (ITS) from specimens, including 42 ex-type strains, is also provided.
Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics. However, it has been noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for those species in the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Additionally, conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, have been considered taxonomically uninformative for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition particularly important for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity.
Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used alongside other characteristics to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum. Available morphological characters include the size and shape of conidiomata (acervuli), conidia, conidiophores, and setae on natural substrates; the size and shape of these features in culture; and the size and shape of appressoria. Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata, and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis.
Morphological characters may also vary with environmental factors, and incubation conditions, such as media and temperature, should be standardized for species comparison and identification. Unfortunately, there is no recommended standard for Colletotrichum cultivation. Different researchers have employed various media and incubation conditions, leading to difficulty in comparing morphological and cultural characters. To ensure consistency in identifying and comparing isolates or species, a standardized protocol for the cultivation of strains
Observations and measurements of conidial size and shape have typically been made using conidial masses mounted in water, cotton blue, or lactic acid. It is important to note that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically compared to those produced in conidiomata. Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are frequently described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have employed potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of synthetic nutrient agar (SNA) cultures. Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionised water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber. However, conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis. Nonetheless, it has been noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (which has relatively smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (which has more lobed appressoria).
Research has shown that appressoria shape and size can be useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species, but these characteristics should be used in combination with host range. Distinctive features of conidial appressoria can help differentiate between two species of Colletotrichum associated with Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex, whereas in C. hymenocallidis they are ovate or sometimes clavate. Cultural characteristics on agar media have also been utilized for the diagnosis of some Colletotrichum species. The conidial morphology of C. gloeosporioides and C. lindemuthianum is similar, but their cultural traits are distinctly different. C. lindemuthianum produces dark pigmentation in media and grows consistently slower than C. gloeosporioides. Similarly, C. musae grows relatively fast, forming effuse colonies and glabrous conidiomata with many conidia, while C. destructivum forms large conidiogenous zones with scattered, relatively short setae and has limited conidial production.
The shape and size of conidia and appressoria, along with cultural characteristics, should be evaluated and used with caution, as these traits are highly dependent on growth conditions. Erroneous diagnoses can largely be avoided if morphology is used in conjunction with other characteristics such as molecular sequence data, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and host
Due to the inadequacies and plasticity of morphological characters, nucleic acid sequence analysis has been regarded as more reliable for Colletotrichum classification. A major drawback in relying on a small proportion of the genome to understand phylogenetic relationships among Colletotrichum strains has been the risk of recreating gene trees rather than species trees. Thus, multi-gene phylogenetics are employed to systematically characterize Colletotrichum species relationships and serve as a basis for species diagnosis. Prihastuti et al. (2009) used six genes: the nuclear rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, partial Actin (ACT), β-tubulin (TUB2), Calmodulin (CAL), Glutamine synthetase (GS), and Glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH) to study a few closely related Colletotrichum species (C. gloeosporioides sensu lato) and established that species relationships could be well resolved. Multi-gene phylogenies were also successfully applied to resolve the relationships among Colletotrichum species with curved conidia from graminicolous and herbaceous hosts. While multi-gene phylogenetics is an accurate and reliable method for diagnosing Colletotrichum species, it is neither very efficient nor economical. It is currently impractical to apply multiple gene phylogenetics to every Colletotrichum species, as different research groups use various gene regions. An international collaborative effort is essential to standardize research on the genus. Hyde et al. (2009) listed all the multi-gene sequences derived from type or epitype cultures of Colletotrichum, providing an excellent platform for data analysis aimed at studying natural species relationships.
The ITS region is the most widely sequenced area, but there are concerns regarding its ability to provide adequate resolution for determining and differentiating Colletotrichum species. Crouch et al. (2009) revealed a high error rate and frequency of misidentification (86%) based on ITS sequence similarity comparisons within the C. graminicola species complex. ITS sequence data in the public domain can cause considerable confusion for the end user; data were often entered under incorrect specific names and may include several cryptic species. Identical sequence data has regularly been entered under different names. An analysis of 343 ITS sequences named “C. gloeosporioides” revealed that over 86% had considerable evolutionary divergence from the type specimen of C. gloeosporioides and most likely represent other Colletotrichum species. It is crucial that sequence data generated from type specimens are used in species similarity comparisons and phylogenetic analysis. Due to ease of acquisition and an extensive library of existing sequences, the ITS region remains useful in some cases for reconstructing interspecific relationships, although it is not an ideal marker for inferring infraspecific relationships. Currently, the ITS region is also the only gene available from all the ex-type or ex-epitype cultures of Colletotrichum species. A phylogenetic tree based on ITS sequence data, which includes sequences originating from 42 ex-type or ex-epitype cultures, is pro
Taxon names, GenBank accession numbers, culture collection numbers, hosts, and origins of the strains are provided in the analysis. The methodology outlined by Cai et al. (2008, 2009) was followed. The backbone tree serves as a rough, quick identification guide to Colletotrichum species. Colletotrichum systematics should utilize a multiple-gene phylogeny and a study of type specimens to establish correlations between genotype and phenotype. The phenotype should be expanded to a polyphasic sense, including morphology, physiology, pathogenicity, infection processes, cultural characteristics, and secondary metabolites (Frisvad, 2004; Samson and Varga, 2007). The genotypes in Colletotrichum appear to correlate with a combination of characters rather than with a single character. These criteria are clearly demonstrated by Crouch et al. (2009b), Damm et al. (2009), and Prihastuti et al. (2009). Crouch et al. (2009b) correlated the well-defined phylogenetic groupings with combined characters of appressoria and host ranges. Prihastuti et al. (2009) established new taxa in the C. gloeosporioides complex that form distinct phylogenetic lineages with unique morphological, cultural, and physiological characteristics. Taylor et al. (2000) suggested that a genealogical concordance method should be used to recognize a phylogenetic species, with three criteria for each lineage: monophyletic, statistically supported, and genealogically concordant (i.e., no conflict among the single gene tree). Our proposal is broader as we also emphasize the importance of correlation with phenotypic characters to develop species concepts in a systematic, biological sense.
Patterns of carbohydrate utilization have been used to resolve the classification of Penicillium species (Bridge, 1985) and have also been employed to differentiate Colletotrichum species (Waller et al., 1993; Prihastuti et al., 2009). Colletotrichum kahawae Waller & Bridge is an economically important pathogen causing coffee berry disease in Africa, distinguishable from other Colletotrichum species on coffee by its inability to utilize citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source (Waller et al., 1993; Prihastuti et al., 2009). There have been considerable controversies regarding whether Colletotrichum kahawae should be considered a valid species or a sub-population of C. gloeosporioides, as C. kahawae can only be distinguished from C. gloeosporioides and other close relatives by biochemical and physiological characters (Correl

Thailand. Colletotrichum asianum can be easily distinguished from C. fructicola and C. siamense (all from coffee) by its much slower growth rate (Prihastuti et al., 2009). The usefulness of physiological characters in differentiating closely related species in Colletotrichum has been well demonstrated for a few species. Unfortunately, such physiological characterizations have not been conducted for most Colletotrichum species. In this paper, we suggest that carbohydrate utilization and relative growth rate should be considered as polyphasic characters to study Colletotrichum, particularly for morphologically indistinguishable species that exhibit phylogenetic distinctiveness.
Pathogenicity testing is crucial to establish whether a particular Colletotrichum species is host-specific or has a wide host range. Host-specific taxa may have a limited distribution, which could have significant biosecurity implications. Conversely, if a taxon has a wide host range, the species is likely to be cosmopolitan and possibly an opportunistic pathogen. Host range studies may provide valuable data for classification and future species delimitation. Koch’s postulates have been applied to confirm the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates. For instance, Vinnere et al. (2002) demonstrated that Rhododendron anthracnose was caused by C. acutatum; Lee et al. (2005) re-infected Euonymus leaves with C. boninense in moist chamber pathogenicity tests; and Tomioka et al. (2008) identified a species referred to as C. dematium (but see Damm et al., 2009) as the causal agent of severe spotting, blight, and leaf drop in Polygonatum falcatum. Descriptions of new species sometimes include data on pathogenicity testing (Nakamura et al., 2006; Moriwaki and Tsukiboshi, 2009; Yang et al., 2009), though this is not always the case (e.g., Farr et al., 2006). Crouch et al. (2009c) confirmed that a new species, C. navitas, caused anthracnose of Panicum virgatum. Much of the pathogenicity work conducted needs to be repeated with verified Colletotrichum species.

It is important to establish whether a particular Colletotrichum species is host-specific or has a wide host range. Host-specific taxa may have a limited distribution, which could have important biosecurity implications. Conversely, if the taxon has a wide host range, the species is likely to be cosmopolitan and possibly an opportunistic pathogen. Host range studies may provide data useful in classification and future delimitation of species. Koch’s postulates have been completed to confirm the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates. For example, Vinnere et al. (2002) showed that Rhododendron anthracnose was caused by C. acutatum; Lee et al. (2005) re-infected Euonymus leaves with C. boninense in moist chamber pathogenicity tests; and Tomioka et al.

There have been few studies using cross-mating tests to distinguish between Colletotrichum species. Guerber et al. (2003) tested isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato and concluded that two phylogenetically isolated clades have retained the ability to mate. Genetic isolation appears to have occurred before reproductive isolation in the C. acutatum complex. In the case of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, sexual compatibility has been reported to be limited to individuals that share the same host range (Brasier, 1987). Cisar et al. (1994) discovered that some isolates of C. gloeosporioides that are pathogenic to distantly related hosts are also sexually compatible. This result aligns with studies on C. acutatum, suggesting that genetically isolated strains may retain the ability to mate. Similar findings have been reported for Fusarium and other fungi (Donoghue, 1985; Taylor et al., 2000; Leslie et al., 2001; Amata et al., in press). Notably, most Colletotrichum species lack a sexual state (Hyde et al., 2009), and many of the known teleomorphs, such as those of C. graminicola and C. sublineolum (Carvajal and Edgerton, 1944; Politis, 1975; Vaillancourt and Hanau, 1992), are characterized based on mating experiments in the laboratory. In this sense, mating experiments are important for a comprehensive understanding of Colletotrichum species and should be undertaken in studies on Colletotrichum.
There have been numerous publications on secondary metabolite production by Colletotrichum species, and the chemical structures of some of these metabolites have been elucidated. However, there have been few attempts to use metabolite profiling as a source of markers for identification and classification purposes or to integrate chemotaxonomy within a polyphasic framework for resolving natural relationships of taxa within Colletotrichum. Secondary metabolite production has been extensively studied in putative strains of C. capsici, C. dematium, C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, C. lagenarium, C. nicotianae, and C. truncatum but was not linked to taxonomy. This stands in distinct contrast to Alternaria, Annulohypoxylon, Aspergillus, Fusarium, Hypoxylon, Penicillium, Stachybotrys, Stemphylium, and Trichoderma species, where secondary metabolites have been found to be valuable taxonomic markers.
One of the few studies of secondary metabolites as taxonomic markers for distinguishing Colletotrichum spp. involved the use of lectins—proteins or gly
Morphotype, virulence phenotype, phylo type, and chemotype were recently used in a polyphasic approach to clarify the taxonomic status of Colletotrichum isolates associated with anthracnose disease of yam (Dioscorea spp.). Four morphotypes of C. gloeosporioides sensu lato were recognized in relation to foliar anthracnose of yam: slow growing grey (SGG), fast growing salmon (FGS), fast growing grey (FGG), and fast growing olive (FGO). The FGG morphotype exhibited greater divergence from the other three morphotypes based on ITS sequence data. Secondary metabolite profiles analyzed through high-performance TLC (HPTLC) and high-performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) indicated that the pathogenic SGG and FGS forms possessed a chemotype (A or B) distinct from the non-pathogenic FGG form (chemotype C). A highly phytotoxic HPLC fraction was detected in virulent FGS and SGG strains but was absent in the FGG strains. Although it was not possible to distinguish between the pathogenic FGS and SGG forms of Colletotrichum based solely on their ITS-based phylogeny, they could be clearly differentiated through a combined analysis of their ITS and metabolite profiles, corroborating a previous finding that these strains represent two genetically distinct populations of C. gloeosporioides on yam. The presence of outliers emphasizes the need for a substantial number of accurately identified strains of the same taxon to ensure robust chemotaxonomic analyses.
The chemotaxonomic approach utilized to elucidate the taxonomic status of Colletotrichum from yam could be applied to resolve the systematics of the genus as a whole. It was noted that the use of secondary metabolite profiling holds significant value in Ascomycetes, which should encourage those planning to apply this tool to Glomerella/Colletotrichum taxonomy. Important methodological considerations for chemotaxonomic studies include ensuring that fungal cultures used in comparative analyses are grown on the same medium, incubated together at the same temperature, and extracted simultaneously to guarantee that differences reflect fungal diversity rather than environmental conditions. Furthermore, HPLC methods need standardization, as the absence of standards for certain known metabolites complicates the identification of many peaks in HPLC-DAD chromatograms.
A new approach to Colletotrichum systematics, which incorporates metabolite profiling, may enhance the understanding of species relationships within this genus. However, accurate species identification and strain characterization using ITS and other sequence data is essential before such studies can proceed. Research in chemotaxonomy within Colletotrichum is still in its early stages, and no specific recommendations are made at this time.
Infraspecific groups within Colletotrichum species are poorly understood and have been largely overlooked in current nomenclature discussions. The current Code of Botanical Nomenclature provides a limited number of formal infraspecific categories, including subspecies, variety, and form. Additionally, categories such as forma specialis and pathotype have been employed by plant pathologists to classify infraspecific groups with distinct host specializations or behaviors.
The use of subspecies, varieties, and forms within Colletotrichum has varied, with 33 introductions recorded between 1940 and 2000. The intermittent use of forma species or varieties appears to depend as much on individual authors as on established rules. Until there is a clear understanding of what constitutes a Colletotrichum species, it may be unwise to consider subspecies, forms, and varieties further. From a pathological viewpoint, there has been more recent usage of forma specialis and pathotype, with pathotypes being the most frequently used in the genus. For true pathotype differences, there must be a qualitative or phenotypic difference in virulence between isolates on a set of differential genotypes. A quantitative difference in severity of infection, based on lesion size, merely reflects variations in aggressiveness of isolates and does not constitute a true pathotype difference.
Identification of pathotypes of Colletotrichum species has been based on qualitative differences in infection, such as C. trifolii in lucerne, C. lindemuthianum in bean, C. acutatum in citrus, C. sublineolum in sorghum, C. capsici in chili pepper, and both C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides in chili pepper, as well as quantitative differences in severity, like C. capsici in chili pepper and C. falcatum in sugarcane, between isolates on specific host genotypes. While there have been reports of races of Colletotrichum species, such races occur only when differences in isolates are determined by variations in virulence genes and corresponding host resistance genes, reflecting a gene-for-gene relationship similar to that seen in rust diseases. Certain studies have linked races of C. trifolii to quantitative trait loci (QTL) conferring resistance in lucerne. However, since the relationship between specific avirulence genes in the pathogen and resistance genes in the host remains unestablished, these variations should be referred to as pathotypes.
Identifying pathotypes is not only important as a taxonomic tool at the infraspecific level of a Colletotrichum species, but also has implications for plant breeders developing new genotypes with durable resistance to pathogens. Pathotypic differences help relate infraspecific taxonomy back to the biological interaction of pathogens with specific host genotypes.
The identification of Colletotrichum species needs to be straightforward and rapid, as it has significant implications for biosecurity, disease control, and plant breeding. There is a concerted effort to establish species concepts and formalize names currently in use. Although morphology may not resolve many issues in species delineation, a polyphasic approach can help establish speci
Summerbell et al. (2005) emphasize the necessity of establishing a DNA barcoding system for Colletotrichum species due to their simple morphologies and the current confusion in taxonomy. The success of this barcoding relies on obtaining highly reliable sequences from type or verified strains and selecting the most appropriate gene(s). The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex comprises taxa with significant biological, morphological, and genetic diversity (Sutton, 1992; Hyde et al., 2009). Some of these taxa, such as C. fragariae (Johnston et al., 2008), have been recognized as separate species. The ITS region has demonstrated a poor ability to discriminate clades within this group, necessitating a more suitable biomarker for barcoding. An ideal locus for barcoding should exhibit low heterogeneity within species while providing enough variation for maximal separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications. Additionally, it is crucial that the gene can be easily sequenced across all species without needing specific primers for each group (Seifert, 2009; Gilmore et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009).
A diverse set of 64 Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato isolates, along with two C. boninense strains as outgroups, were analyzed based on previous work by Johnston et al. (2008). Each isolate was sequenced for six genes: ITS, GPDH (glycerol-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), CAL (calmodulin), ACT (actin), CHS (chitin synthase), and EF1α (elongation factor 1α). The 64 taxa were classified into five groups according to a multigene phylogeny (Johnston et al., 2008). Two groups represented named species (C. fragariae and C. horii), while one group included Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto. The remaining two groups, A and B (sensu Johnston and Jones, 1997), comprised mainly unnamed isolates, with C. musae in Group A and C. kahawae in Group B. A similarity matrix was generated for each gene, and the results were analyzed using TaxonGap 2.4.1 (Slabbinck et al., 2008). The results illustrate the heterogeneity within each assigned group and the separability of species. Separability, which indicates the gene's ability to distinguish between groups, yielded
CHS, GPDH, histone 3, and beta-tubulin were used by Damm et al. (2009) to study Colletotrichum species with curved conidia from herbaceous hosts, which included six different clades. The separability of the species was best with both GPDH and histone 3 genes, which were superior to ITS, ACT, CHS, and beta-tubulin. The most appropriate gene for barcoding Colletotrichum must be selected during the species delimitation process, as the selection of one or more barcoding genes can only be made when the taxa needing distinction are identified. A good approach would be to test and establish a selection of loci used by various groups involved in Colletotrichum systematics to work towards identifying the best barcoding gene.
Detailed protocols for studying Colletotrichum species include:
Isolation: For endophytes and pathogens without visible sporulation, plant tissues are cut into small pieces, surface sterilized by dipping in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 1 minute, followed by 70% ethanol for 1 minute, and then rinsed three times with sterilized water before being dried on sterilized tissue paper. The plant tissues are then placed onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) containing 100 μg/ml streptomycin and 50 μg/ml tetracycline to allow for fungal growth. The mycelia that grow from the pieces of plant tissues are transferred onto a new PDA plate for morphological or molecular study (Than et al., 2008b).
For pathogens or epiphytes with visible sporulation, a single spore isolation technique should be applied to plant tissues where spore masses are formed. Spore masses are transferred with a sterilized wire loop or fine forceps and suspended in sterilized water. The spore suspension is diluted to an appropriate concentration and spread onto the surface of PDA agar, followed by incubation overnight at 25°C. Single germinated spores are then picked up with a sterilized needle and transferred onto a new PDA plate for further study (Goh et al., 1999).
Morphological Studies: Standardizing incubation parameters for Colletotrichum species is necessary, as comparing the morphology of species grown under different conditions can be challenging or impossible. For inoculation, it is recommended to aseptically punch and transfer a mycelial disc (approximately 4 mm in diameter) from the actively growing edge of a 5-day-old single conidium-derived culture onto PDA. Cultures are incubated at 20, 25, and 30°C under constant
To facilitate future study and comprehensive comparison of Colletotrichum species, it is important to reach an agreement on how many and which genes should be sequenced. An even more critical issue is the interpretation of phylogenetic groups in terms of classification. Currently, there is no consensus on what constitutes a species, although researchers have begun adopting "genealogical concordance" to recognize phylogenetic species. In this paper, we suggest that species rank should be assigned to well-defined phylogenetic lineages that are associated with recognizable phenotypic characters.
Growth Rate
To measure growth rate, aseptically transfer a mycelial disc (about 4 mm in diameter) from the actively growing edge of a 5-day-old single conidium-derived culture onto PDA. Cultures are incubated at 25°C under constant fluorescent light. Three replicate cultures of each isolate should be investigated. The colony diameter of the culture is measured daily for 7 days, and the growth rate is calculated as the 7-day average of mean daily growth (mm per day). After 7 days, record the colony size, color of the conidial masses, and zonation.
Biochemical Tests
Biochemical testing can also be utilized, as it has been reported in several studies that biochemical characters, especially the ability to utilize citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source, could differentiate some closely related species. The biochemical test based on substrate utilization can be assessed in agar plates. Medium B (containing NH3H2PO4 1.0 g/L, KCl 0.2 g/L, MgSO4·7H2O 0.2 g/L in distilled water) with 1.2% (w/v) agar is supplemented with 1% (w/v) citric acid or ammonium tartrate and 0.005% (w/v) bromocresol purple. Positive and negative controls containing glucose or no additional carbon source, respectively, are included for each isolate. All media should be adjusted to pH 4.5 with NaOH or HCl prior to sterilization. Test media are inoculated with agar plugs (4 mm in diameter) taken from 5-day-old single conidium-derived cultures. Utilization is assessed by visually comparing growth and observing a rise in the pH of the medium sufficient to produce a dark blue to purple color of bromocresol purple.
Fungal Diversity
The slide culture technique used to induce the formation of appressoria involves several steps: A s
The surface-sterilized fruits and leaves are placed in a plastic box that contains sterile tissue paper soaked in sterile distilled water to maintain around 95% relative humidity. The samples are inoculated using the wound/drop and non-wound/drop inoculation methods. The wound/drop method is accomplished by pin-pricking the fruit or leaf with a sterile needle in the middle portion and then placing 6 μl of conidia suspension onto the wound. Control fruits and leaves are inoculated with 6 μl of sterile distilled water. The inoculated samples are incubated in containers at room temperature under normal light conditions for 7–14 days. The non-wound/drop method involves placing 6 μl of conidial suspension onto the middle of each fruit or leaf.
Evaluation of anthracnose symptoms, such as lesion appearance, size, conidia characteristics, and infection severity, is conducted from 7 to 14 days after inoculation. Lesion development on fruits and leaves is assessed by calculating the percentage of the diseased area on each fruit and leaf (lesion area divided by the total fruit or leaf area). Symptoms are evaluated and scored on a 0-9 point scale based on the percentage of the infected area. The scoring system is as follows: a score of 0 indicates no infection; 1 indicates 1–2% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesions or larger water-soaked lesions surrounding the infection site; 3 indicates more than 2–5% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesions, with acervuli potentially present; 5 indicates 5–15% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesions, with acervuli present; 7 indicates 15–25% of the fruit area shows necrotic lesions with acervuli; and 9 indicates more than 25% of the fruit area shows necrosis, often encircling the fruit, with abundant acervuli.
It is noteworthy that artificial inoculations are often performed on detached or whole plants under extreme conditions, and the success of infection seems to depend on inoculum density. No infection may occur under field conditions. While artificial host inoculation may not reliably determine host range or specificity, it serves as an indicator of infection potential. Research has indicated that pathogenicity tests may not be reliable on detached plant tissues due to the suppression of host defense pathways.
For mating tests, we follow the protocol outlined in previous studies. Modified Czapek-Dox agar media is prepared with specific nutrient compositions. For inoculation, a mycelial disc from the actively growing edge of a 5-day-old single conidium-derived culture is aseptically transferred to the agar. Two parental isolates are positioned opposite each other and approximately 1 cm from the edge of 9 cm Petri plates. Autoclaved flat woody
Ascomata are removed from the toothpick using fine forceps and mounted in a drop of sterilized water, then crushed under a cover slip. A combination of a qualitative and quantitative rating system is used to score the sexual fertility of each cross. Fertility of a cross is scored on a scale of 0–7: 0 = no structures; 1 = small sterile structures; 2 = sterile perithecia with beaks, no asci; 3 = sterile perithecia with asci, no ascospores; 4 = asci with a few ascospores; 5 = fertile perithecia with many ascospores, few asci with eight spores; 6 = fertile perithecia with abundant ascospores, many asci with eight spores; 7 = perithecia exuding ascospores from the ostiole. Crosses scored 5 or higher are considered fertile. Ascospore viability should be assessed for crosses with a fertility score above 4. Monoascospore cultures are obtained by removing an individual ascomata and placing it into a drop of sterile water. The ascospores released into the water are spread onto PDA for growth.
Species concepts in Colletotrichum have evolved from the use of basic morphological data to a polyphasic approach that incorporates a powerful molecular component. This evolution has rendered traditional classification less practical, as holotypes or other types are currently not very useful since DNA cannot usually be extracted. It is recommended that a polyphasic approach be adopted in future studies before new species of Colletotrichum are introduced or epitypes are designated, incorporating molecular, morphological, physiological, and pathogenic data.
Protocols for describing new species and epitypes include: 1. A detailed morphological description of the fungus should be provided, with examples noted. 2. The proposed new species should exhibit sufficient evolutionary divergence from closely related taxa based on multiple gene sequence analyses, with comparisons made to type specimens. 3. Multiple gene loci should be characterized, such as ITS, TUB2, GPDH, ACT, and others, with sequences deposited in a recognized international database. 4. Media used for descriptions and comparison should be as recommended, and where possible, descriptions should include collections from host tissues. 5. Ex-type cultures of any new Colletotrichum species should be deposited in at least two internationally recognized culture collections, with all information registered in MycoBank. 6. Details of growth rates in a standard medium at a standard temperature and growth conditions should be included. 7. When considering the suitability of a specific specimen and derived culture as an epitype and ex-epitype, three basic rules should be followed: A) it should be from the original host, B) from the original geographic locality, and C) have well-matched morphology and phenotypic characters with the type, which should be examined if available and preferentially illustrated. When an epitype is designated, the holotype, lectotype, or neotype that the epitype supports must be explicitly cited. 8. Pathogenicity testing may be useful and should be conducted where possible.
