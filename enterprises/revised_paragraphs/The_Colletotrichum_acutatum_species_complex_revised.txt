Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is known as an important anthracnose pathogen of a wide range of host plants worldwide. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. Multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) of 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and other related taxa, including strains from numerous hosts with wide geographic distributions, confirmed the molecular groups previously recognized and identified a series of novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not previously been recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. There is a high phenotypic diversity within this complex, and some of the species appear to have preferences for specific hosts or geographical regions. Others appear to be plurivorous and are present in multiple regions. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture, although sexual morphs have been described from other taxa (especially as laboratory crosses), and there is evidence of hybridization between different species. One species with similar morphology to C. acutatum but not belonging to this species complex was also described here as new, namely C. pseudoacutatum.

INTRODUCTION
Colletotrichum acutatum is one of the most frequently reported species of the genus and causes diseases commonly known as anthracnose on numerous host plants worldwide. Originally described from diseased tissues of Carica papaya, Capsicum frutescens, and Delphinium ajacis in Australia, the C. acutatum species complex is known to be especially destructive on fruits like strawberry, citrus, apple, olive, cranberry, and blueberry. It is also implicated in the “terminal crook” disease of pine and in the anthracnose of leather leaf fern. There are also reports of a disseminated infection of a sea turtle and the infection of a scale insect.
Reviews of the species and its pathology were published, highlighting its impact on strawberry, where C. acutatum mainly causes black spot of fruit but can also attack crowns, roots, and leaves, making it one of the most serious diseases in commercial fruit production. Due to its economic importance, C. acutatum was treated as a regulated plant quarantine pest by the European and Mediterranean Plant Protection Organization, although it is absent from the current list, presumably due to its widespread distribution in Europe. Inoculum sources often include transplant material with quiescent infections, infected plants, weeds, and other hosts, while the survival rate of conidia in natural field soil is low.
The most well-known morphological feature of C. acutatum is the shape of its conidia, which have acute ends. However, other conidial shapes, particularly cylindrical with one acute end, are frequently encountered, especially in strains that have been repeatedly subcultured. Differentiating between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides is also challenging due to the existence of many intermediate strains. On the host, conidia are formed in acervuli; in culture, conidia are often produced in the aerial mycelium. C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on the surface of living strawberry leaves, stimulated by strawberry plant extracts. According to some studies, secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia and are smaller and more variable in shape, obscuring differences between taxa. Additionally, C. acutatum forms simple pigmented appressoria, with few or no setae.
Guerber and Correll (1997, 2001) described Glomerella acutata, the sexual morph of C. acutatum, as the product of mating experiments, while some related species are homothallic, including Ga. acutata var. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008), which was later regarded as a separate species (C. fioriniae, Shivas & Tan 2009), and an isolate of a Glomerella species related to C. acutata from Acer platanoides in the USA (LoBuglio & Pfister 2008). Talgø et al. (2007) observed the sexual morph Ga. acutata on naturally infected fruits of highbush blueberry in Norway. Numerous studies have shown that C. acutatum is morphologically and phylogenetically diverse (Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1994, Johnston & Jones 1997, Lardner et al. 1999, Freeman et al. 2001a, Nirenberg et al. 2002, Talhinhas et al. 2002, Guerber et al. 2003, Lubbe et al. 2004, Du et al. 2005, Peres et al. 2005, Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas 2005, Talhinhas et al. 2005, Johnston et al. 2008). Sreenivasaprasad et al. (1996) were the first to recognize that C. acutatum was unusually diverse, with strains showing a divergence of 5.8% in ITS-1 sequence compared to levels of 2–4% frequently found within other fungal species, and they suggested splitting C. acutatum into two species. Johnston and Jones (1997) recognized four morphological groups: C. acutatum A–C and Glomerella miyabeana. Three of these groups were supported by 28S nuclear ribosomal large subunit rRNA (LSU) sequence data. Lardner et al. (1999), using a combination of RAPDs and morphological/cultural data, identified seven subordinate groups within C. acutatum. Sequences of a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) and a 900-bp intron of the glutamine synthetase GS distinguished seven main clades and several subclades within strains that originated mainly from North America and New Zealand (Guerber et al. 2003). The recognition of infraspecific groups was more firmly established by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005), who distinguished clades A1 to A8 based on rDNA ITS and beta-tubulin DNA (TUB2) sequences. These clades were mostly correlated with the groups that had been distinguished previously. Whitelaw-Weckert et al. (2007) recognized an additional group, A9. At this point, it was widely presumed that C. acutatum was a species complex containing several constituent taxa, but there was substantial reluctance to recognize the clades involved as independent species. This was due to the lack of differential morphological and cultural characters. For example, C. lupini was not recognized as formally separate from C. acutatum by Talhinhas et al. (2002) or by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005). There were some attempts to address these concerns via the adoption of formae speciales, such as C. acutatum f. sp. pineum (Dingley & Gilmour 1972), C. acutatum f. sp. hakeae (Lubbe et al. 2004), and C. acutatum f. sp. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008), but this mechanism for recognition of pathology-related taxa is now rarely used. Gradually, separate species were recognized or accepted as part of the C. acutatum species complex, such as C. lupini (Nirenberg et al. 2002) and C. phormii (Farr et al. 2006). In a study using two genes, ITS and TUB2, combined with morphological data, Shivas & Tan (2009) recognized three distinct groups within C. acutatum strains from Australia and accepted two new species, C. simmondsii and C. fioriniae (formerly C. acutatum f. sp. fioriniae) for groups A2 and A3. Recently, a new species was described for group A4, C. clavatum (Faedda et al. 2011). Our research aims to present a comprehensive revision of the C. acutatum species complex. We thoroughly survey the constituent taxa and delineate additional species where needed.
We have examined a large number of C. acutatum s. lat. strains, isolated from various hosts and geographic areas. Multi-locus molecular analysis is the basis of species recognition, but morphological and cultural characters allowing alternative means of species recognition are provided where possible.
MATERIALS AND METHODS
Isolates
A total of 331 strains have been studied, mostly previously identified as C. acutatum, as well as other related strains from the CBS, IMI, and other culture collections. Type material (holotypes and epitypes) of the species studied is located in the Herbarium of the Centraalbureau voor Schimmelcultures (CBS), Utrecht, The Netherlands; in the IMI Fungarium, which is based in the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew (IMI and K(M)), UK; the US National Fungus Collections (BPI), Beltsville, Maryland, USA; the Botanic Garden and Botanical Museum Berlin-Dahlem, Freie Universität Berlin (B), Germany; and in the dried collection of the Botanische Staatssammlung München (M), Germany. All descriptions are based on the ex-type, ex-epitype, or ex-neotype culture as appropriate. Features of other strains are added if deviant. Subcultures of the types, epitypes, and neotypes, respectively, as well as all other isolates used for morphological and sequence analyses, are maintained in the culture collections of CBS and IMI.
Morphological Analysis
To enhance sporulation, autoclaved filter paper and double-autoclaved stems of Anthriscus sylvestris were placed onto the surface of synthetic nutrient-poor agar medium (SNA; Nirenberg 1976). SNA and oatmeal agar (OA; Crous et al. 2009) cultures were incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod for 10 days. Measurements and photographs of characteristic structures were made according to Damm et al. (2007). Appressoria on hyphae were observed on the reverse side of SNA plates. Microscopic preparations were made in clear lactic acid, with 30 measurements per structure, and observed with a Nikon SMZ1000 dissecting microscope (DM) or with a Nikon Eclipse 80i microscope using differential interference contrast (DIC) illumination. In the C. acutatum species complex, conidia are usually formed in acervular conidiomata and additionally in the aerial mycelium. Unless mentioned otherwise, only conidia from conidiomata were used in this study for morphological examination. Colony characters and pigment production on SNA and OA cultures incubated at 20 °C under near UV light with a 12-hour photoperiod were noted after 10 days. Colony colors were rated according to Rayner (1970). Growth rates were measured after 7 and 10 days.
Phylogenetic Analysis
Genomic DNA of the isolates was extracted using the method of Damm et al. (2008). The 5.8S nuclear ribosomal gene with the two flanking internal transcribed spacers (ITS), a 200-bp intron of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and partial sequences of the chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), histone 3 (HIS3), actin (ACT), and beta-tubulin (TUB2) genes were amplified and sequenced using the primer pairs ITS-1F (Gardes & Bruns 1993) + ITS-4 (White et al. 1990) or V9G (de Hoog & Gerrits van den Ende 1998) + ITS 4, GDF1 + GDR1 (Guerber et al. 2003), CHS-354R + CHS-79F (Carbone & Kohn 1999), CYLH3F + CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b), ACT-512F + ACT-783R (Carbone & Kohn 1999), and BT2Fd + BT4R (Woudenberg et al. 2009) or T1 (O’Donnell & Cigelnik 1997) + Bt-2b (Glass & Donaldson 1995), respectively. The PCRs were performed in a 2720 Thermal Cycler (Applied Biosystems, Foster City, California) in a total volume of 12.5 μL. The GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3, ACT, and TUB2 P
Germany), 2 mM MgCl2, 20 μM of each dNTP, 0.7 μL DMSO, and 0.25 U Taq DNA polymerase (Bioline). Conditions for PCR of these genes included an initial denaturation step of 5 minutes at 94 °C, followed by 40 cycles of 30 seconds at 94 °C, 30 seconds at 52 °C, and 30 seconds at 72 °C, concluding with a final denaturation step of 7 minutes at 72 °C. The ITS PCR was performed as described by Woudenberg et al. (2009). The DNA sequences generated with forward and reverse primers were used to obtain consensus sequences using Bionumerics v. 4.60 (Applied Maths, St-Marthens-Lathem, Belgium), and the alignment was assembled and manually adjusted using Sequence Alignment Editor v. 2.0a11 (Rambaut 2002). To determine whether the six sequence datasets were congruent and combinable, tree topologies of 70% reciprocal Neighbour-Joining bootstrap with Maximum Likelihood distances (10,000 replicates), with substitution models determined separately for each partition using MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004), were compared visually (Mason-Gamer & Kellogg 1996). A maximum parsimony analysis was performed on the multilocus alignment (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3, ACT, TUB2) as well as for each gene separately with PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) v. 4.0b10 (Swofford 2000) using the heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing, and all characters were unordered and of equal weight. No more than 10 trees of score (length) greater than or equal to 10 were saved in each replicate. The robustness of the trees obtained was evaluated by 10,000 bootstrap replications using the Fast-stepwise addition algorithm (Hillis & Bull 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting tree. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) for the combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3 were included for each gene partition. The analyses of two MCMC chains were run from random trees for 1,000,000 generations and sampled every 100 generations. The likelihood scores of the two runs were 2,500 and 2,200; therefore, the first 2,350 (the average of both) trees were discarded as the burn-in phase of the analysis, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. For additional comparison, a Neighbour-Joining analysis was performed on the multigene alignment using PAUP and 1,000 bootstrap replications. Sequences derived in this study have been lodged at GenBank, the alignment in TreeBASE, and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004a).
RESULTS Phylogeny
The six sequence datasets did not show any conflicts in tree topology for the 70% reciprocal bootstrap trees, which allowed us to proceed. One of the 830 most parsimonious trees obtained from a heuristic search of the combined ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT, HIS3, and TUB2 sequences alignment of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is shown. Bootstrap support values above 70% (bold) and Bayesian posterior probability values above 0.95 are indicated at the nodes.
Colletotrichum orchidophilum CBS 632.80, CBS 631.80, IMI 309357, and CBS 119291 are used as outgroups. Numbers of ex-holotype, ex-neotype, and ex-epitype strains are emphasized in bold. Strain numbers are followed by substrate (host genus) and country of origin: NL = Netherlands, NZ = New Zealand, ZA = South Africa. Branches that are crossed by diagonal lines are shortened by 50%. Corresponding groups from Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) are emphasized in red, while mtDNA RFLP haplotypes from Guerber et al. (2003) are emphasized in blue.
The data includes various strains of the genus Lupinus from multiple countries: CBS 109225 from Ukraine, CBS 109216 from Bolivia, CBS 513.97 from Costa Rica, CBS 109226 from Canada, CBS 509.97 from France, and CBS 466.76 from Rwanda. Additional strains include IMI 375715 from Australia, CBS 122746 from the USA, and several strains from Germany (CBS 109217, CBS 485.97, CBS 109219, CBS 109220, CBS 109221, CBS 109222, CBS 109223, CBS 109224, CBS 109227). Other notable strains are CBS 126525 from the Netherlands, CBS 119142 and CBS 119143 from South Africa, and IMI 351261 from the UK. The list also features strains from various genera, including Cinnamomum from Portugal, Solanum from Colombia, and Passiflora from Colombia.
In the multigene analyses involving 330 isolates of C. acutatum and related Colletotrichum species, including the outgroup strains (C. orchidophilum strains CBS 631.80, CBS 632.80, CBS 119291, IMI 309357), a total of 2,290 characters, including alignment gaps, were processed. Among these, 468 characters were parsimony-informative, 65 were parsimony-uninformative, and 1,757 were constant. One strain, CBS 436.77 (C. pseudoacutatum), was excluded from the analysis presented. After a heuristic search using PAUP, 830 most parsimonious trees were retained, with a length of 1,008 steps, CI = 0.643, RI = 0.981, RC = 0.681, and HI = 0.357. The topology of these trees was similar, verified across a large selection, differing only in the position of taxa within the subclades. For Bayesian analysis, a HKY+I model was selected for ITS, and HKY+G models were chosen for GAPDH and TUB2.
K80+I+G model for CHS-1, a HKY+I+G model for HIS3, a GTR+G model for ACT, and incorporated in the analysis. The consensus tree obtained from Bayesian analyses and the NJ tree (not shown) confirmed the tree topology obtained with parsimony. Bayesian posterior probability values agreed with bootstrap supports.
The table presents a list of species and their respective identifiers, locations, and additional notes. It includes entries such as CBS 515.78 for Nymphaea from the Netherlands, CBS 516.78 for Nuphar from the Netherlands, and various Fragaria specimens with identifiers indicating their country of origin, including France, Bulgaria, and the USA. Additionally, the list features multiple Protea specimens from various regions, as well as species such as Capsicum, Hevea, and Eucalyptus, with corresponding identifiers and geographic information.
The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex includes a detailed analysis of various isolates. The study identified five main clades and 29 subclades within C. acutatum s. lat., which are recognized as representing different Colletotrichum species. These groups correspond to previous research by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) and Guerber et al. (2003), which are referenced in the phylogenetic tree. The first clade is strongly supported, boasting a bootstrap support of 100% and a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. It comprises two frequently isolated and well-supported clades.
Additionally, the analysis details various isolates, including those from different plant species and geographical locations, illustrating a wide diversity within the complex. Specific entries include isolates from Malus, Fragaria, Vaccinium, and other genera, alongside their respective country of origin, emphasizing the ecological significance and distribution of these pathogens.
Bayesian posterior probability values indicate several strains in clade 1, comprising C. lupini (A1, J2/J6) and C. tamarilloi (A8), with values of 100/1.00. Other less frequently encountered subclades in this clade include C. costaricense (94/1.00) with two strains, along with C. cuscutae and C. melonis, both represented by single-strain clades on long branches. Additionally, there are several short-branched single-strain clades, including the known species C. limetticola (J3) and six further unnamed strains. The majority of strains in clade 2 (A2, 86/1.00) belong to C. nymphaeae (98/1.00, D2/D4), while most of the other 11 subclades of this clade are occupied by only one or a few strains. The clade representing C. scovillei (99/1.00) consists of three strains and groups (98/1.00) with a single-strain clade formed by C. guajavae. These two adjacent clades likely correspond to clade D3 in Guerber et al. (2003). The other sister clades represent C. simmondsii (99/1.00), C. chrysanthemi (100/1.00), C. paxtonii (99/1.00), C. laticiphilum (99/1.00), C. cosmi, C. walleri, C. sloanei, C. indonesiense, and C. brisbanense, the last five of which consist of single-strain clades. Clades 3 and 4 are well-supported (100/1.00 and 100/0.87) and are on long branches; they represent C. fioriniae (A3, C1/C2/C3) and C. acutatum (A5, J4). Clade 5 consists of two sister clades. Colletotrichum godetiae (A4, F1*, 99/1.00), formed by a large number of strains, belongs to the first sister clade and groups (97/1.00) with C. johnstonii (F8, 100/1.00) and a single-strain clade representing C. pyricola (F2). The other sister clade (75/1.00) consists of six subclades: a large, long-branched, and almost homogeneous subclade representing C. salicis (A7, K1, 100/1.00); a short-branched subclade representing C. phormii (91/1.00); C. rhombiforme (A6, 100/1.00), which groups with a single-strain clade representing C. acerbum on a long branch (F1*, 100/1.00); plus C. australe (100/1.00) and C. kinghornii on long branches.
Strains named F1 appear in the phylogeny of Guerber et al. (2003) in different subclades, corresponding to C. acerbum, C. godetiae, and probably also C. rhombiforme. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is only distantly related to the C. acutatum complex and is therefore not included in the phylogeny, while C. orchidophilum was found to be more closely related and was therefore used as an outgroup. The phylogenetic position of these and all other species included here is exhibited in figures 1 and 2 of Cannon et al. (2012, this issue).
The individual alignments and maximum parsimony analyses of the six single genes were compared with respect to their performance in species recognition. With ITS and CHS-1, only 11 and 13 species, respectively, can be recognized. All subclades are recognized with TUB2 and GAPDH. TUB2 performs better than GAPDH due to higher numbers of base pair differences, but even with TUB2, there are clades with differences of only 1 bp, which suggests that both genes should be used for identification. The performance of the other two genes is intermediate between ITS and TUB2/GAPDH.
Based on DNA sequence data and morphology, the 331 strains studied are assigned to 31 species, of which 29 species are within the C. acutatum species complex and two outside this group, including 21 species that proved to be new to science. Two species formed sexual morphs in vitro. All species studied in culture are characterized below.
Colletotrichum acerbum Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800494.
Etymology: acerbus = Latin for bitter; referring to bitter rot, the vernacular name for Colletotrichum disease of apple. Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–6 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata absent, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 30 µm long.

Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is buff to honey, almost entirely covered with floccose-felty white to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium and olivaceous grey to salmon acervuli. The reverse is buff, pale olivaceous grey, grey olivaceous to iron-grey, with a growth rate of 17.5–20 mm in 7 days (27.5–30 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are salmon to orange.
Material examined: New Zealand, Nelson, from bitter rot on fruit of Malus domestica, 1 Aug. 1987, P.R. Johnston, (CBS H-20725 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 128530 = ICMP 12921 = PRJ 1199.3).
Notes: Bitter rot has been considered an economically significant disease of apple for many years (Schrenk & Spaulding 1903b) and was initially ascribed to Gloeosporium fructigenum (Berkeley 1856). However, Berkeley’s type was examined by Vinnere (2004) and found to have falcate conidia, thus excluding it from the C. acutatum species complex. Currently, bitter rot is primarily caused by fungi from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (González et al. 2006). That study focused on strains from the USA and Brazil, and we do not know whether their C. acutatum s. lat. strains are conspecific with C. acerbum. Those of Lee et al. (2007) from Korea are referable to C. acutatum clades 2 (C. nymphaeae and related species) and 3 (C. fioriniae), suggesting that the host is susceptible to a wide range of Colletotrichum pathogens. The ex-type strain of C. acerbum is the only strain included in our study representing C. acutatum group B as delineated by Lardner et al. (1999). It may be common on Malus in New Zealand, but Lardner et al. (1999) found that more strains from fruit rot of apple, as well as from feijoa and fig, belonged to group C and had similar RAPD banding patterns. It is possible that their group C includes more than one species. The GAPDH sequence of strain PJ9 (= PRJ 819 in Lardner et al. 1999), isolated from apple in New Zealand and sequenced by Guerber et al. (2003), is identical to that of CBS 128530, the ex-type strain of C. acerbum.
Colletotrichum acerbum is distinguishable from C. rhombiforme and all other species in all gene sequences analyzed except for CHS-1, and is most effectively distinguished with TUB2 and ITS. Morphologically, its conidia are longer, and the appressoria are shorter and wider than those of C. rhombiforme. Based on our studies and blastn searches in GenBank, it seems that C. acerbum could be endemic to New Zealand. The closest match based on TUB2 sequence that we could find (with 99% identity, 5 bp differences) was AJ748624 from isolate PT250 (= CBS 129953), derived from olive in Portugal (Talhinhas et al. 2005), which we assign to C. rhombiforme. The closest matches for the ITS sequence of C. acerbum (with 99% identity, 3 bp differences) were with the ITS of C. phormii
Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae 1–5.5 µm in diameter, hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores not observed. Conidiomata absent; conidiophores formed directly on vegetative hyphae. Setae not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, mostly simple, sometimes septate and branched, reaching up to 25 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to slightly inflated, often not clearly separated from subtending hyphae by a septum, measuring 3.5–20 × 2–3.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter; the collarette is distinct, measuring 1–1.5 µm long, with conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends acute, measuring (7.5–)11–14.5(–19) × 3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.6 ± 1.8 × 3.9 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.2. Conidia from strains CBS 112759, CBS 112979, and CBS 979.69 differ in being cylindrical to clavate, with one round and one acute end; for example, conidia of strain CBS 112759 are smaller, measuring (6.5–)8.5–12(–13) × (2.5–)3–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.3 ± 1.9 × 3.4 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.1. Appressoria are solitary, medium brown, smooth-walled, ellipsoidal to obovate, with entire edges that are sometimes undulate, measuring (4–)5.5–9(–13) × (3–)4–6.5(–9.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 7.3 ± 2.0 × 5.4 ± 1.2 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3.

Conidiophores are hyaline, septate, branched, and smooth-walled, reaching up to 50 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, measuring 9–18 × 3–3.5 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter; the collarette is distinct, measuring 0.5 µm long, and periclinal thickening is conspicuous. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and fusiform to cylindrical, with apex and base uniformly acute, measuring (8.5–)12–16.5(–17.5) × (3–)3.5–4.5(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.3 ± 2.1 × 4.1 ± 0.4 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.5. Conidia from strains CBS 112759, CBS 370.73, and CBS 112979 differ in being cylindrical to clavate and in having one round and one acute end; conidia from strain CBS 370.73 are smaller, measuring (5–)6.5–11(–12.5)

Notes: Colletotrichum acutatum was described by Simmonds (1965) from a range of different hosts in Australia. No type was designated, and the name was validated three years later (Simmonds 1968) with the designation of a holotype, IMI 117617 from Carica papaya, and paratypes from C. papaya (IMI 117618 - IMI 117621), Capsicum frutescens (IMI 117622), and Delphinium sp. (IMI 117623). Vinnere et al. (2002) sequenced the ITS region of the holotype specimen (AF411700) and one paratype specimen IMI 117619 (AF411701) and found morphological and cultural differences among Simmonds’s six holotype/paratype specimens of C. acutatum. There is no living ex-holotype culture available, but two ex-paratype strains exist, one from Carica papaya (IMI 117620 = QDPI&F plant disease log book no. 16633D = ATCC 56816 = CBS 112996 = STE-U 5292) and one from Capsicum frutescens (IMI 117622 = QDPI&F plant disease log book no. 11711A = CBS 292.67, see C. brisbanense), along with an ex-topotype strain from Carica
International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi and Plants (ICN) as they are based on fungus/plant interactions rather than single species, and formal ICN-compliant taxa cannot use formae speciales as basionyms for new combinations. Colletotrichum acutatum f. sp. pinea (Dingley & Gilmour 1972) was described for a malady of pines called terminal crook disease, with the fungus apparently causing malformation of growing tips. We have examined authentic cultures derived from Dingley & Gilmour’s work, which were also used by von Arx. Most of these cannot be distinguished in morphological or molecular terms from C. acutatum s. str., but strain CBS 436.77 (from Chile, not from New Zealand as are the authentic cultures of C. acutatum f. sp. pinea) belongs to a quite different species outside of the C. acutatum species complex (see C. pseudoacutatum). CBS 797.72 appears to show evidence of hybrid origin and is not included in the molecular analyses. Colletotrichum acutatum f. sp. hakeae (Lubbe et al. 2004) was introduced for an apparently strongly host-specific set of strains, one of which was being used as a potential biological control agent, but we have not found any morphological differences and there are few sequence-based differences (1 bp difference in ITS, 2 bp differences in HIS3) between these and other C. acutatum s. str. strains. We therefore do not feel confident to recognize this forma specialis on that basis as a segregate species. Colletotrichum acutatum f. sp. chromogenum was described by Baxter et al. (1983), based on strains from olive referred to as Gloeosporium fructigenum f. sp. chromogenum by Gorter (1962), for strains producing pink to purple pigments in culture. Such pigment production is common throughout the C. acutatum complex and is especially prominent in C. acutatum s. str. (as their clade A5) according to Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005). In fact, the only strain from olive in South Africa included in this study (CBS 127589) belongs to this species and could represent C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum. However, the rank used is inappropriate for this purpose. A variety of C. acutatum, described on Fiorinia externa (a scale insect), C. acutatum var. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008), was recognized as the separate species C. fioriniae by Shivas & Tan (2009) and is included below in this study. A sexual morph was described for C. acutatum (Guerber & Correll 1997, 2001), based on mating-compatible strains in the laboratory. The cross designated as type of Glomerella acutata was based on two cultures, ATCC 56816 and ATCC MYA-662. The first of these is derived from one of Simmonds’ original Queensland collections from papaya, IMI 117620 (here designated as epitype of C. acutatum). There is ongoing confusion regarding the provenance of this strain; Guerber & Correll (2001) and Than et al. (2008b) wrongly equated ATCC 56816 with IMI 117617, the holotype, and that congruence is recorded as such in the ATCC catalogue. The second strain, ATCC MYA-662, was isolated from apple in Louisiana, USA, and is here assigned to C. fioriniae in clade 3. Fertile sexual morphs were also produced by Guerber & Correll (2001) and Guerber et al. (2003) by mating a series of different strains, including crosses between parents that are both assigned to C. fioriniae. None of the strains tested was self-fertile. The holotype of Glomerella acutata is therefore an interspecific hybrid between C. acutatum and C. fioriniae. This might be construed as strong evidence that these two taxa constitute a single biological species, and therefore that the species concepts used in this paper are much too narrow. However, the parent strains of the holotype are not self-fertile.
The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex originates from highly distant populations in geographical terms, and there are instances in other fungal groups (e.g., Neurospora) where non-sympatric populations lose post-mating reproductive isolation barriers (Turner et al. 2010, 2011). Further research on population structures and mating-type barriers would be instructive. Colletotrichum acutatum has subsequently been reported to produce a sexual morph in nature on Vaccinium corymbosum (highbush blueberry) in Norway (Talgø et al. 2007). Sequence-based identification was apparently not carried out, so the identity of this population remains uncertain; however, the blueberry pathogen is usually C. fioriniae, which has a known sexual morph (Marcelino et al. 2008). Its origin is also unknown; the crop is not native to Norway, and the fungus may have been introduced from the USA along with planting material. The Glomerella sexual morph described from Acer platanoides in Massachusetts, USA, is homothallic (LoBuglio & Pfister 2008) and belongs to C. salicis, not C. acutatum s. str. Two strains from this research are included in our study. Further discussion may be found in Cannon et al. (2012, this issue). A further twist in the story may be provided by CBS 797.72; this is one of the strains on which C. acutatum f. sp. pinea was based (Dingley & Gilmour 1972). Sequences of three of the six genes sampled (ACT, HIS3, and CHS-1) indicate affinities with C. acutatum (clade 4), but the other three (ITS, GAPDH, and TUB2) suggest that the strain belongs to C. fioriniae (clade 3). This was confirmed by repeating sequencing from a new subculture from the CBS collection and after re-singlesporing of one of the single spore isolates. This too may be of hybrid origin. The phylogeny by Guerber et al. (2003) includes strains from Pinus in New Zealand in both species (as groups J4 and C1). We do not know if they should be assigned to C. fioriniae or are hybrids as well. The widespread geographical range and economic importance of C. acutatum make it likely that an earlier name exists for the species, probably listed as a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Walker et al. (1991) noted that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) is such a candidate based on the fusiform shape of conidia found on the type material, but no authentic cultures exist, and no other strain from Xanthium with fusiform conidia was available to us. It is therefore impossible to determine whether this species provides an earlier name for C. acutatum s. str., for another species within the C. acutatum complex, or belongs to the C. acutatum species complex at all (see C. pseudoacutatum). Apart from C. acutatum and C. simmondsii, there have been other Colletotrichum and Gloeosporium species described on Carica papaya, all from Brazil. Conidia of C. papayae Henn., described from branches and petioles of papaya in São Paulo, are larger and differ in shape from C. acutatum s. str.; they are cylindrical, straight to curved, hyaline, and measure 12–20 × 5–7 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931), while those of C. acutatum measure on average 8.8–15.5 × 3.2–4.5 µm, depend
Phomopsis. Gloeosporium fructus-caricae Henn. forms conidia that overlap in size with those of C. acutatum; however, their shape is described as oblong-cylindrical with both ends rounded, while conidia of C. acutatum usually have both ends acute. Even if the description matches completely with that of C. acutatum, we cannot be sure they are the same species; the morphology of most species in the C. acutatum species complex is highly variable and overlapping. There is no strain from papaya in Brazil included in this study, and there is no report of C. acutatum s. lat. from Brazil listed in Farr & Rossman (2012). We have tried to draw a reasonable balance between respect for the rules of priority and the need for nomenclatural stability, and in this case, we feel that Simmonds’ name should be conserved if such a synonymy is established. Colletotrichum acutatum is separated from other species by all genes. Closest matches in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 112996, with 100% identity, were GU183307–GU183309 and GU183311–GU183314, from Boronia, Anemone, Fragaria, Pistacia, Olea, Ranunculus, and Mangifera in Australia (Shivas & Tan 2009), FJ788419 from Simmonds’ specimen 16633D from Carica papaya in Australia (Weir & Johnston, unpubl. data), AY376546–AY376549 and AY376558–AY376568 from Pinus, Leucadendron, Carica (STE-U 5292 = CBS 112996), and Hakea (Lubbe et al. 2004), AJ748627 and AJ748630 from Phlox and Statice (Talhinhas et al. 2005), HE573032 from Arbutus unedo (strawberry tree) (Polizzi et al. 2011), and with 99% identity (1 or 2 bp difference) AY376550 and AY376545 from Protea and Leucospermum (Lubbe et al. 2004) and AJ748618 from Olea (Talhinhas et al. 2005). Colletotrichum acutatum s. str. can therefore be assumed to be a widespread species that causes disease symptoms on a wide range of plants.

AJ748624 from olive, Portugal (Talhinhas et al. 2005). We do not think that any of these sequences are derived from strains that are conspecific with C. australe. With the GAPDH sequence, there was no closer match than 87% identity. The closest matches with the ITS sequence, with 99% sequence identity, include Glomerella cingulata BBA 70991 from Salix (AJ301952, Nirenberg et al. 2002) and Glomerella sp. strain MP3 from Acer platanoides (EU622052, LoBuglio & Pfister 2008), which are both likely to be C. salicis. Other strains with 99% ITS sequence homology include that deposited as Fusarium phormii strain CBS 198.35 (DQ286144, Farr et al. 2006), which we assign to C. kinghornii, and Ga. acutata PT715 from Olea europaea in Portugal (AM991135, Talhinhas et al. 2009).

The type and only confirmed strain of C. brisbanense was cited as one of the paratype strains of C. acutatum by Simmonds (1968) and assigned to C. simmondsii by Shivas & Tan (2009). Conidia and appressoria of C. brisbanense are larger overall than those of C. simmondsii, as accepted in this treatment. The two species are easily separable using all sequence data except for ITS, and most effectively with TUB2 and GAPDH sequences. There is only one base pair difference in the CHS-1 sequence between C. brisbanense and C. indonesiense. Additionally, there is another species in clade 2 associated with Capsicum annuum, C. scovillei, which is possibly a species endemic to Southeast Asia. Colletotrichum brisbanense can be easily separated from C. scovillei based on appressorium measurements, as well as by most DNA data. A BLAST search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 292.67 resulted in a 100% match with GU183275, the sequence of the same strain generated by Shivas & Tan (2009). The next closest match was DQ454064 from isolate S6 from Fragaria in Thailand with 99% identity (four differences; Sang et al. 2011). With the GAPDH sequence, there was no match with more than 95% identity. The ITS sequence of strain CBS 292.67 matched 100% with GU183315, a sequence of the same isolate generated by Shivas & Tan (2009).

Material examined: Netherlands, Emmeloord, from the twisted stem of Carthamus sp., unknown collection date and collector, culture CBS 126518 = PD 84/520; from vascular discoloration of Glebionis carinata, collection date and collector unknown, culture CBS 126519. China, Hong Kong, from leaf spot of Glebionis coronaria, (deposited in IMI 1994 by Wan-chi Ko as culture no. 1964), culture IMI 365540.
Notes: Gloeosporium chrysanthemi was described by Hori as causing severe anthracnose disease in Chrysanthemum coronarium (= Glebionis coronaria) in the Fukuoka prefecture in Japan (Takimoto 1924) and was transferred to Colletotrichum by Sawada (1943). A pathogen of another Asteraceae plant, Carthamus tinctorius, was described in Japan by Fukui as Marssonia carthami (Fukui 1916, see also Tanaka 1917). The fungus was transferred to Gloeosporium by Hori & Hemmi. Uematsu et al. (2012) re-examined authentic specimens of C. chrysanthemi collected by Takimoto in 1919 and of G. carthami collected by Hemmi in 1915 and sequenced the ITS1 and TUB2 regions of these specimens, as well as isolates from Carthamus, Chrysanthemum, and Calendula species from Japan. The resulting sequences placed the two species in the C. acutatum species complex. While all specimens and strains had almost identical ITS sequences, there were two groups in the TUB2 phylogeny, placing most of the Calendula isolates with the authentic specimen of Gm. carthami, and the Chrysanthemum and Carthamus isolates, as well as two Calendula isolates, with the authentic specimen of Gm. chrysanthemi, suggesting that the two species are separate. Despite this, the authors regard C. chrysanthemi as a synonym of the older species G. carthami. Based on TUB2 sequences of the authentic specimens (AB696992, AB696993) and some of the strains from Calendula (AB688785, AB688787), Carthamus (AB688807, AB688811), and Chrysanthemum (AB688791) included in our alignment (not shown), isolates studied here group with the Japanese isolates from Carthamus and Chrysanthemum and the authentic specimen of Gm. chrysanthemi. Therefore, we treat them here as C. chrysanthemi. The TUB2 sequences of the Calendula isolates and the authentic material of Gm. carthami appear to belong to a different clade that is not included in our study.
There are few additional reports of Colletotrichum on Carthamus, Chrysanthemum, and Calendula. Sette et al. (1999) reported C. acutatum on Carthamus tinctorius in Korea; the fungus formed strongly fusiform conidia and formed setae at least occasionally on the host plant and PDA medium. Vichova et al. (2011) found C. simmondsii on Carthamus tinctorius in the Czech Republic. There is another species that was also described o

Morphological characters (conidia, appressoria) are similar to those of strain CBS 853.73, except for setae, which our strain did not develop under standard culture conditions. It is therefore possible that the collection from Korea represents C. cosmi. Colletotrichum acutatum (s. lat.) is also known as an anthracnose pathogen of flowers and flower buds of Cosmos bipinnatus in Japan (Yaguchi et al. 1996). The shape of conidia and appressoria of the Japanese fungus are similar to our strain, but the conidia are smaller, measuring 11–14 × 2.8–3.5 µm. Two other species are reported from Cosmos bipinnatus in India: C. truncatum (as C. capsici), associated with seeds and causing seed and seedling rot (Srivastava et al. 1981), and C. gloeosporioides, associated with leaves (Kumari et al. 1981). When strain CBS 853.73 was first introduced into CBS, von Arx identified it as C. gloeosporioides, but remarked that it was "deviating by longer, slender conidia." Molecular data do not support this identification; the strain belongs to the C. acutatum complex, although reports of C. gloeosporioides may refer to this species. Colletotrichum cosmi is part of clade 2 and can be separated from other species by all gene sequences, but mostly with only 1 bp divergence. There are greater sequence divergences in GAPDH and HIS3; however, with these genes individually, the species falls within the highly variable C. nymphaeae clade. The closest match in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 853.73 (with 99% identity, 4 bp differences) was GU246633 from isolate R14 from Capsicum annuum from South Korea (Sang et al. 2011), while the closest match with the GAPDH sequence covering approximately the full-length sequence (with 98% identity, 4 bp differences) was HQ846724 from isolate OBP6 from an unknown plant, probably from India (P. Chowdappa, C.S. Chethana, S. Madhura, unpubl. data). We do not consider these data in isolation sufficient evidence to identify these sequences as originating from C. cosmi. There are 22 sequences in GenBank that match the ITS sequence of strain CBS 853.73 with 99% identity, all with 2 bp differences.
Colletotrichum cosmi (from ex-holotype strain CBS 853.73) displays conidiomata and conidiophores, with appressoria and conidia observed. The conidiomata are noted for their development on Anthriscus stems. The scale bars indicate that A = 200 µm, B = 100 µm, and C = 10 µm, with the scale bar of C applying to images C–P.
Colletotrichum costaricense Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800499. Etymology: Named after the country where it was collected, Costa Rica. Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–9.5 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores are not observed. Conidiomata are not developed; conidiophores form directly on hyphae. Setae are not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, simple or septate, and branched. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, with polyphialides observed, measuring 4.5–24 × 2–3.5 µm, with openings of 0.5–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes of 0.5–1.5 µm long, showing visible periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, and cylindrical with acute ends, measuring (9–)11.5–18(–28) × (3–)3.5–4(–4.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.6 ± 3.1 × 3.7 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.0. Appressoria are sparse, occurring singly or in small groups, pale brown, smooth-walled, subglobose to elliptical, wit
Setae medium to dark brown, smooth-walled to finely verruculose, 0–2-septate, 50–60 µm long, base cylindrical, 3.5–4.5 µm in diameter, the tip ± acute. Conidiophores hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, up to 40 µm long. Conidiogenous cells hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, measuring 8–22 × 3–5 µm, with openings 1–1.5 µm in diameter, and a collarette 1–1.5 µm long; periclinal thickening is distinct. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (12.5–) 13.5–16(–18) × 3.5–4 µm, with a mean ± SD of 14.8 ± 1.4 × 3.8 ± 0.3 µm, and a length-to-width ratio of 3.9.
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline to pale cinnamon, on Anthriscus stem partly olivaceous grey to iron-grey, on filter paper pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey, exhibiting short or woolly white aerial mycelium and few salmon acervuli on filter paper and on Anthriscus stem; the reverse of filter paper shows the same colors. The growth rate is 19–22.5 mm in 7 days (31–34 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is olivaceous with pale olivaceous grey to olivaceous grey sectors, which are covered with short white aerial mycelium and salmon acervuli, or the culture is completely covered with short felty whitish aerial mycelium. The reverse is honey, olivaceous grey to iron-grey, with a growth rate of 22–23 mm in 7 days (28.5–34.5 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass appear salmon to saffron.
Material examined: Costa Rica, Meseta Central, from the berry of Coffea arabica cv. Typica, collection date and collector unknown (deposited in CBS collection Jun. 1975 by D. Mulder, Wageningen), (CBS H-20811 holotype, culture ex-type CBS 330.75); Turrialba, from a twig of Coffea sp., collection date and collector unknown (deposited in CBS collection Apr. 1978 by C. Bianchini), culture CBS 211.78 = IMI 309622.
Notes: Von Arx (in litt.) identified the strain CBS 330.75 as C. acutatum but remarked that it deviates by lacking pigment and having less fusiform conidia. While the main causal agent of coffee berry disease (CBD) is C. kahawae (Waller et al. 1993), which belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012), strains from the C. acutatum aggregate are not frequently encountered associated with coffee. Hindorf (1973) studied Colletotrichum populations from Coffea arabica in Kenya and illustrated that conidia or ascospores of some strains diverged in morphology and culture appearance, including a strain identified as C. acutatum and another as C. gloeosporioides, with some conidia being ellipsoidal and acute-ended. One of the two strains from western Kenya assigned to C. acutatum s. str. is derived from a suspected disease symptom on a coffee berry from Kenya that did not cause CBD (Gielink & Vermeulen, 1983). An endophytic strain from Coffea robusta in Brazil studied by Sette et al. (2006), showing antimicrobial activity against Staphylococcus aureus, belongs to the C. acutatum species complex; however, as only a short ITS sequence of this strain was generated (DQ123614), the species cannot be identified. Colletotrichum walleri (clade 2) is known from a single strain from coffee in Vietnam. Colletotrichum costaricense is quite distinct from either of these taxa based on molecular sequence data. Two Colletotrichum species have previously been described from leaves of Coffea sp. in Costa Rica, C. brachysporum and others.
C. coffeophilum. Conidia of the first species are smaller than those of C. costaricense and have a different shape; they are subglobose to ovoid and measure 7–8 × 4–6 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931), while those of C. costaricense measure on average 14.6 × 3.7 µm or 14.8 × 3.8 µm, depending on the medium. Conidia of C. coffeophilum are wider than those of C. costaricense, being ellipsoidal and straight or slightly curved (navicular), measuring 13–15 × 6–8 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931). Colletotrichum costaricense can be differentiated from the other species accepted here by TUB2, GAPDH, and ACT sequences, most effectively with TUB2. The ACT sequences of the two strains differ by 2 bp but share only 1 bp in common to separate them from C. lupini and some of the unnamed single strains. The closest match in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 330.75, showing 99% identity (3 bp differences), was FN611028 from a Citrus sinensis isolate (Ramos et al. 2006), while the closest matches with the GAPDH sequence, also with 99% identity (2 differences), were EU647322 and EU647324 from leatherleaf fern isolates (MacKenzie et al. 2009). All isolates were from Florida, USA. The closest matches with the ITS sequence, showing 100% identity, were FN566877 from isolate DPI from Citrus aurantifolia in Florida, USA (Ramos et al. 2006), and isolate c2 from Citrus sp. in Brazil (Giaretta et al. 2010).
Colletotrichum cuscutae Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800500. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Cuscuta. Sexual morph not observed. Asexual morph on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–5.5 µm in diameter, are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores were not observed. Conidiomata were not developed; conidiophores are formed directly on hyphae. Setae were not observed. Conidiophores are hyaline, smooth-walled, simple or septate and branched, measuring up to 35 µm long. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical to ampulliform, often integrated; polyphialides are occasionally observed. Discrete phialides measure 4–14.5 × 2.5–4.5 µm, with openings of 1.5–2 µm in diameter and collarettes 0.5–1.5 µm long, exhibiting conspicuous periclinal thickening. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical with both ends acute, measuring (15.5–)17.5–21(–27) × (3–)3.5–4.5 µm, with a mean ± SD of 19.2 ± 1.7 × 4.0 ± 0.3 µm, and an L/W ratio of 4.8. Appressoria are single or in loose clusters, pale brown, smooth-walled, elliptical to clavate, with entire edges measuring (3.5–)5.5–11.5(–15.5) × (2–)3.5–5.5(–6.5) µm, with a
Notes: Colletotrichum cuscutae is known from a single strain reported from Dominica. The multigene analysis indicates that it occupies a single subclade within clade 1, quite distinct from the principal subclade of C. lupini. Its conidia are substantially longer than is typical for C. lupini (mean length 18.6 µm as opposed to 12 µm for C. lupini), though the length range for the latter species is considerable. The appressoria of C. cuscutae are narrower than those of C. lupini and also have a greater length/width ratio. Colletotrichum species have been reported previously as parasitizing Cuscuta species, which are themselves non-photosynthetic parasites of other plants. Colletotrichum destructivum was found to affect Cuscuta campestris parasitizing alfalfa crops in the northwestern USA (Leach 1958). A strain identified as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. cuscutae was apparently used widely as a biological control agent, “Lu Bao no. 1,” for Cuscuta in China after its adoption in the 1960s (Zhang 1985, Gao & Gan 1992), but its current commercial status is unknown, and it may no longer be in production (Watson et al. 2000). According to Watson et al. (2000) and Dinoor et al. (2009), the Lu Bao strain belongs to C. acutatum rather than C. gloeosporioides. However, no detailed morphological data are available, and the identification as C. acutatum was made using primers that at that time were considered to be species-specific for the two species that are now both recognized as species complexes. Guerber et al. (2003) studied isolates from Cuscuta in the USA and China that belong to two different species, neither of which is conspecific with C. cuscutae. Based on GAPDH sequences, isolates FRC2 and FRC7 from dodder in the USA are C. fioriniae, while strain 783 from China (apparently identical to strain Lu Bao no. 1) belongs to a subclade of clade 2 that is not included in this study. Strain 783 was found to have a haplotype of MspI mtDNA identical to those of two Australian strains causing terminal crook disease of pine, and distinct from those of other Cuscuta strains. In an attempt to compare endophytes of a Cuscuta parasite and its hosts in India, Suryanarayanan et al. (2000) isolated 44 fungal endophytes from Cuscuta reflexa, including C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and a “Colletotrichum sp.” that was not further characterized. None of the strains are included in this study, and there are no corresponding sequences available on GenBank. Colletotrichum cuscutae is separated from other species by all genes studied except for ITS, most effectively by TUB2 and ACT. In blastn searches with the ITS, TUB2, and GAPDH sequences of the ex-type strain IMI 304802, no sequence matched with 100% homology. The closest matches with the TUB2 sequence (with 98% identity, 8 bp differences) were FN611029 and FN611028 from Citrus aurantifolia and Citrus sinensis from Florida, USA (Ramos et al. 2006), while the closest matches with the GAPDH sequence (with 98% identity and 4 bp differences) were EU168905, EU647318, and EU647319 from sweet orange (Peres et al. 2008, MacKenzie et al. 2009). In a blastn search with the ITS sequence, a large number of strains were 99% identical to that of strain IMI 304802, including several ITS sequences from Key lime isolates, e.g.,

Conidia of CBS 200.35 differ in sometimes having one round and one slightly acute end; conidia of strain CBS 129947 are smaller, measuring (13–)14–16(–17) × (3.5–)4–4.5(–5) µm, mean ± SD = 15.0 ± 1.0 × 4.3 ± 0.4 µm, L/W ratio = 3.5 µm.
Culture characteristic
DPI 13120; Queensland, Yarwun, endophytic from the stem of Mangifera indica, 16 Feb. 1994, G.I. Johnson, culture CBS 127601 = BRIP 28761a. Portugal, Lisbon, from Vitis vinifera, 2000, collector unknown, culture CBS 129947. Notes: Colletotrichum fioriniae is the only representative of clade 3, which is supported by all six genes individually (including ITS). The clade has been recognized as distinct within the C. acutatum species complex for some years now (Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas 2005) and was accepted as a separate species by Shivas & Tan (2009). In the current study, a large number of strains (over 50) has been found to belong to this species. They were isolated from a wide variety of host plants, primarily in temperate zones. There is some evidence of heterogeneity within the species, as two subclades are apparent in the phylogenetic analysis, but neither bootstrap support nor Bayesian probability values are sufficiently high to justify their recognition at the species level. Also, strains from the major hosts and countries appear throughout the clade.
The name C. fioriniae is based on C. acutatum var. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008), named for a series of strains isolated from an epizootic infection of the exotic scale insect Fiorinia externa in the New England region. The implication of Colletotrichum species as entomopathogens might be considered surprising. However, the insects in question are sap-suckers, and C. fioriniae was found to occur widely as an endophyte (Marcelino et al. 2009), both in the host plant of the scale insect (Tsuga canadensis) and in a phylogenetically diverse set of associated plants. This appears to represent a further case of mutualism between Colletotrichum and its host plants, with endophytic strains acting as natural protectants against insect herbivory. A similar case was reported for a strain labeled C. gloeosporioides f. sp. ortheziidae (probably belonging to C. nymphaeae, see notes there) parasitizing the economically important citrus scale insect Orthezia praelonga in Brazil (Cesnik et al. 1996). Endophytic Colletotrichum strains have been demonstrated to protect Theobroma cacao plants against Phytophthora pathogens (Arnold et al. 2003, Mejía et al. 2008, Rojas et al. 2010). Strains referred to as C. acutatum and identified here as C. fioriniae have been implicated in fruit rot of cranberry and blueberry throughout the northern USA and in British Columbia (MacKenzie et al. 2009, Polashock et al. 2009). In fruit-rot assays by Freeman & Shabi (1996), isolates from apple and peach (based on ITS sequence, probably identifiable as...).
Colletotrichum fioriniae produced lesions on many different fruits, suggesting that isolates of this group have the ability to cross-infect fruit from multiple hosts. All of the fruits tested in the study (almond, apple, avocado, mango, nectarine) are host plants of C. fioriniae. In pathogenicity tests, MacKenzie et al. (2009) showed that isolates from blueberry (C. fioriniae) did not cause lesions on strawberry leaves but caused anthracnose on strawberry fruits, although the lesions were smaller than those caused by isolates from strawberry (C. nymphaeae). MacKenzie et al. (2009) concluded that the probability of an epidemic on strawberry in Florida caused by blueberry isolates is rather low, but added that climate could also play a role. In Florida, ripe rot of blueberry fruits is predominantly caused by C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.), while further north in temperate regions, it is most frequently caused by C. acutatum (s. lat.). According to our study, both species occur on strawberry, but based on the number of strains observed, C. fioriniae seems to be of rather minor importance compared to C. nymphaeae. Marcelino et al. (2008) found that strains of C. fioriniae could be crossed to form a sexual morph and that some appeared to be self-fertile, though it is not clear whether the self-fertile strains were derived from single spores. We did not observe sexual production in the strains examined during the present study. An earlier name may exist for C. fioriniae, Gnomoniopsis rubicola, one of a group of five species (including G. cingulata) on which the genus Glomerella was based. That species was described from diseased leaves of Rubus strigosus in West Virginia. No cultures are available, and the description of the asexual morph is not detailed, but Marcelino et al. (2009) showed that C. fioriniae is widespread in the region, and both taxa produce a sexual morph. Kadow (1935) ascribed a disease of raspberry from the same region to G. rubicola, and a culture derived from his work has been examined in the current study and confirmed as belonging to C. fioriniae. Without sequence-based evidence from type material, however, we are reluctant to adopt this earlier name. As far as we can tell, a combination into Colletotrichum has never formally been made. The name C. rubicola was cited on herbarium labels by Ellis & Everhart but only as an asexual name for Glomerella rubicola; it was apparently never accompanied by a description. Colletotrichum fioriniae is separated from other species by all gene sequences studied. The closest matches in a blastn search with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 128517, with 100% identity, were AY376557 (from apple in the USA) and AJ748628 from Liriodendron tulipifera in the UK. With 99% identity, a series of matches could be made, including AJ748610 and AJ748623 from olive in Portugal, AJ748626 from Nandina domestica, and AJ748634 from Magnolia in the UK. Further sequences with the same level of homology include AJ311668 from Vitis vinifera, EF593320–EF593326 from Fiorinia externa, EF593329 from blueberry, and EF593330 from tomato (all from the USA), GU183274 from Acacia acuminata, GU183273, GU183270, and GU183268 from Persea americana, GU183267 from Actinidia chinensis, and GU183269 from Mangifera indica (all from Australia), AB618092 from Apium graveolens var. dulce (celery) in Japan, and AB273716 from grape in Japan. All of these are likely to represent strains of C. fioriniae, further emphasizing its widespread distribution and presumably also its wide host range as a pathogen.

Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform, with both ends acute or one end rounded and one end slightly acute, measuring (7–)10.5–14.5(–15.5) × (3.5–)4–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 12.4 ± 2.0 × 4.3 ± 0.5 µm and a length-to-width ratio of 2.9. Strains CBS 127561, CBS 129917, CBS 193.32, and CBS 129951 differ in forming cylindrical to clavate conidia with one round and one acute end. Conidia of strain CBS 862.70 are larger, measuring (8–)14–19(–24) × (4–)4.5–5(–5.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 16.4 ± 2.4 × 4.9 ± 0.4 µm and a length-to-width ratio of 3.4. Appressoria are solitary, medium brown, smooth-walled, clavate to elliptical, with edges entire or undulate, measuring (8–)9–12.5(–14.5) × (3–)4–5.5(–6) µm, with a mean ± SD of 10.7 ± 1.9 × 4.7 ± 0.7 µm and a length-to-width ratio of 2.3. The asexual morph is found on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are absent, and conidiophores are formed directly on hyphae in aerial mycelium (in strain CBS 125972, present as a cushion of angular to roundish cells measuring 4–10 µm in diameter). Setae are not observed (in strain CBS 125972, very few setae are present, medium brown, smooth-walled, 2–3-septate, measuring 70–110 µm long, with a cylindrical base of 4–5 µm in diameter and an acute tip). Conidiophores are hyaline, septate, branched, and smooth-walled.

Templeton as C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes), G.E. Templeton, culture CBS 796.72. Notes: Colletotrichum godetiae was described from seed of Clarkia (syn. Godetia) hybrida cv. Kelvedon Glory by Neergard (1943) and validated with a Latin description seven years later (Neergard 1950). Colletotrichum godetiae corresponds to the C. acutatum group A4 as recognized by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) and to part of clade F as defined by Guerber et al. (2003). According to Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005), group A4 corresponds to group B from New Zealand (Lardner et al. 1999). However, the only C. acutatum group B strain from New Zealand that we have studied belongs to C. acerbum (A6-2). Faedda et al. (2011) described strains from group A4 that cause olive anthracnose in Italy as C. clavatum, not knowing that an older name for this species exists, of which the ex-holotype culture is available in the CBS culture collection.
The ex-holo- and ex-paratype strains are included in the study. Colletotrichum godetiae is represented by various strains, with conidiomata and different structures such as conidiophores and appressoria. The study also notes the variations in conidial shapes, which can be fusiform or clavate depending on the strain and growth medium. It emphasizes that the conidial shape is an unreliable character for species recognition. The isolates from Rhododendron in Sweden and Latvia, along with other Latin American strains, have been grouped based on their genetic data, indicating the complexity within the species. The conidial characteristics vary significantly, illustrating the influence of the host or medium on their morphology. One isolate studied, CBS 796.72, was deposited in the CBS collection in August 1972 by G.E. Templeton.
C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes appears to be an authentic strain of this forma specialis (Daniel et al. 1973). Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes caused an epidemic anthracnose disease of northern jointvetch (Aeschynomene virginica) in 1969 in Arkansas, USA, and was successfully applied as a biological control agent against this weed in subsequent years. According to our multigene phylogeny, this isolate belongs to the C. godetiae clade. Daniel et al. (1973) reported that C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes is specific to Aeschynomene species, being more virulent to A. virginica than to A. indica, and it did not affect rice, soybeans, cotton, or 12 other common crops tested. The fungus developed as the weed biocontrol agent Collego (TeBeest 1988, Ditmore et al. 2008) against A. virginica, is also named C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes, and is genetically distinct from C. godetiae. It belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex and is newly described in this volume as C. aeschynomenes (Weir et al. 2012, this issue). This is likely the reason for the differences noted in the host range by TeBeest (1988). There is also some confusion about the host plant. Aeschynomene virginica, considered a weed of soybean and rice fields, is actually misidentified as A. indica, while the true A. virginica is rare and threatened, having been federally listed as a threatened species in the United States in 1992.
Colletotrichum godetiae is separated from other species in the C. acutatum species complex by all genes except CHS-1, which has the same sequence as in C. johnstonii; TUB2, ACT, and HIS3 best separate the species. With all genes, the interspecific variation is high. Blastn searches with the TUB2 sequence of CBS 133.44 resulted in 100% identity with several GenBank accessions from olive isolates studied by Talhinhas et al. (2005) and one (AJ409294) from a Fragaria isolate (Talhinhas et al. 2002), followed by 99% identity with AJ409302 from a Ceanothus isolate in France (Talhinhas et al. 2002). These are all likely referable to C. godetiae.
Colletotrichum guajavae Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800501. Etymology: Named after the host plant, Psidium guajava. The sexual morph has not been observed. The asexual morph is present on SNA. Vegetative hyphae measure 1–6 µm in diameter, are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Chlamydospores have not been observed. Conidiomata are not developed, with conidiophores formed directly on hyphae. Setae have not been observed. Conidiophores are hyaline to pale brown, smooth-walled, septate, branched, and can reach up to 30 µm in length. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, smooth-walled, cylindrical, with some polyphialides observed, measuring 7–19 × 3–4 µm, with openings of 1–1.5 µm in diameter and collarettes of 0.5–1 µm long, with periclinal thickening visible. Conidia are hyaline, smooth-walled, aseptate, straight, cylindrical to fusiform with both ends slightly acute, measuring (6–)10.5–16.5(–23.5) × (2.5–)3–4(–5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 13.4 ± 3.0 × 3.5 ± 0.5 µm, and an L/W ratio of 3.8. Appressoria are formed singly, medium brown, smooth-walled, subglobose or elliptical to clavate, with an entire outline, measuring (4.5–)5–8(–10.5) × (3.5–)4.5–6(–6.5) µm, with a mean ± SD of 6.6 ± 1.4 × 5.2 ± 0.7 µm, and an L/W ratio of 1.3. The asexual morph is present on Anthriscus stem. Conidiomata are acervular, with conidiophores formed on pale brown, angular, basal cells measuring 2.5–8 µm in diameter. Setae are medium brown, smooth-walled, 0–2-septate, measuring 40–75 µm long, with a cylindrical base that is sometimes inflated, measuring 3–6 µm in diameter at the wid
Culture characteristics: Colonies on SNA are flat with an entire margin, hyaline, buff to pale honey, and on filter paper partly pale olivaceous grey. On medium, filter paper, and Anthriscus stem, they are partly covered with a whitish to pale olivaceous grey floccose-felty aerial mycelium; the reverse of the filter paper is smoke grey to grey olivaceous. The growth rate is 22–24 mm in 7 days (31.5–34 mm in 10 days). Colonies on OA are flat with an entire margin; the surface is white, pale olivaceous grey to rosy buff, covered with thin floccose-felty whitish to pale olivaceous grey aerial mycelium, with the reverse rosy buff and grey olivaceous to olivaceous black. The growth rate is 24–26.5 mm in 7 days (35.5–37 mm in 10 days). Conidia in mass are salmon.
Material examined: India, Assam, Silchar, from the fruit of Psidium guajava, collection date and collector unknown (deposited in IMI 1991 by M. Das as isolate India No. 1), (IMI 350839 holotype, CBS H-20793 isotype, culture ex-type IMI 350839).
Notes: Anthracnose and fruit canker of guava are serious diseases in the Indian subcontinent, and according to Misra (2004), they are caused in part by C. psidii. However, the identity of the guava pathogen in the sense of Misra is unclear, as the conidia are described as sickle-shaped. Curzi (1927) described the conidia of C. psidii as cylindrical with both ends rounded, straight, sometimes slightly curved, measuring 12–15 × 3.5–4.5 µm. Based on the study of an authentic strain from Psidium sp. in Italy, C. psidii belongs to the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). A separate taxon, Glomerella psidii (apparently based on Gloeosporium psidii), causes the “mummy disease” of guava and has uncertain relationships. The sexual morph was formed on apple Damm et al. agar and resembled Glomerella. The Gloeosporium stage it links to may well fall within the C. acutatum complex: Gm. psidii, described from Psidium pomiferi (= Psidium guajava) in Mexico, forms ellipsoidal-ovoid conidia measuring 10–16 × 4–6 µm (Saccardo 1906); its conidia are thus broader than those of C. guajavae. Gloeosporium fructus-psidii was found on fruits of Psidium in São Paulo, Brazil, and was described as forming oblong, subfusoid to clavate, hyaline conidia measuring 14–20 × 5–6 µm (Saccardo et al. 1931). The shape of the conidia of that species also points to the C. acutatum complex; however, there is no species in this complex with conidia on average generally wider than 5 µm. Conidia of C. guajavae are substantially smaller, measuring on average 13.4 × 3.5 µm on SNA and 14.6 × 3.8 µm on Anthriscus stem. Peres et al. (2002) isolated C. acutatum (s. lat.) from a guava fruit in Brazil, causing lesions on guava fruits that were slightly larger than those caused by a C. acutatum (s. lat.) isolate from strawberry. Based on the ITS sequences they generated, the isolates from guava and strawberry from Brazil belong to the same major clade as C. guajavae; the ITS sequence is identical to that of C. guajavae, but also the same as several other species in this complex, making identification to species level impossible without additional informat
Colletotrichum guajavae can be distinguished from other species of clade 2 of the C. acutatum complex using TUB2, GAPDH, and ACT sequences, most effectively with GAPDH. With data from GAPDH alone, the species sits within the highly variable C. nymphaeae cluster. With TUB2 and ACT, there is only a 1 bp difference between C. guajavae and C. scovillei, while CHS1 and HIS3 sequences are identical to those of C. scovillei. Colletotrichum guajavae is not reliably distinguishable from these species using morphological characteristics. Blastn searches with the GAPDH sequence of strain CBS 853.73 show 100% identity with HM038337 from Colletotrichum sp. isolate MFU 09 0624 from Ziziphus mauritiana (jujube) from Laos, indicating that this strain likely belongs to C. guajavae. The closest match with the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 853.73, with 100% identity, was GU246633 from isolate R14 from Capsicum annuum from South Korea. We identify that isolate as C. scovillei; the available sequence does not include the region containing the single nucleotide polymorphism that distinguishes TUB2 sequences of C. guajavae and C. scovillei.
