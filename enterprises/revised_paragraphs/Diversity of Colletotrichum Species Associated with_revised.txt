Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is mainly caused by species belonging to the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect several parts of the fruit crops; however, infection during postharvest or ripening stages is responsible for major economic losses. Due to the formation of black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, anthracnose reduces fruit quality and marketability. Among the most common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose are mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit; these are economically relevant products in many developing countries. It is important to document that the newly recorded Colletotrichum spp. associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, but some species may be host-specific. By using multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been reported as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Taking into account that disease management strategies strongly rely on adequate knowledge of the causative agents, updated information on Colletotrichum species and the hazards posed by the most recently identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits becomes vital. Furthermore, the newly recorded species may be important for biosecurity and should be listed as quarantine pathogens, considering that tropical fruits are traded worldwide.

1. Introduction
Asia and countries of the Pacific region are major tropical fruit crop producers, followed by Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Minor producers include the United States and Oceania. The main tropical fruits are mango, pineapple, avocado, and papaya, with mango representing the most significant production worldwide. The majority of tropical fruits are produced in India, the leading producer of mango and papaya, followed by Thailand, Mexico, China, Brazil, and Indonesia. Minor tropical fruits include guava, longan, litchi, durian, passion fruit, rambutan, and mangosteen, with China and India being the largest producers. Tropical fruit crops are susceptible to infection by Colletotrichum species, which typically cause anthracnose. Anthracnose infection commonly occurs in the fields during the flowering and fruiting stages. Different factors may affect Colletotrichum infection, including humidity, temperature, fruit condition, and inoculum concentration. Host infection generally begins with conidial germination and is followed by the formation of appressoria and penetration pegs, which are fungal structures that assist in penetrating host tissues. In some cases, direct
After infection, many anthracnose pathogens adopt quiescence or latency, which is common in pathogens causing postharvest diseases, including Colletotrichum. During the latent period, anthracnose pathogens remain dormant within the host tissues until environmental conditions and host physiology are conducive for their reactivation and further development. Reactivation occurs particularly when fruits ripen. Anthracnose symptoms often develop after harvest, during storage, transportation, and marketing.
Anthracnose pathogens infect not only fruits but also other plant organs, including leaves, flowers, twigs, and branches. The conidia and spores formed in these infected tissues are subsequently released and dispersed during rainy days through water splashes or during high humidity periods, thus becoming the primary inoculum for fruit infection at the preharvest stage. The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions containing conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions may merge to produce larger lesions. These black or dark brown lesions on the surface appear unattractive to consumers and significantly reduce the market value of such fruits.
Before the application of molecular-based phylogenetic analysis using multiple markers for the taxonomic and systematic revision of Colletotrichum spp., only two species, Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, were reported to be associated with anthracnose symptoms in many tropical fruit crops. However, more recent phylogenetic analysis established that these two species belong to two complexes called “acutatum” and “gloeosporioides,” with several other species included within them. A summary of the Colletotrichum species reported to be associated with anthracnose of tropical fruit crops from several countries indicates that many species were identified based on phylogenetic analysis of multiple markers. Many Colletotrichum species that are part of these complexes are reported to cause anthracnose. Some species are known to infect specific hosts, while others infect multiple hosts. Anthracnose pathogens that infect multiple hosts may indicate the development of cross-infection ability. Based on a cross-pathogenicity study, several species within the C. gloeosporioides complex were found to have the capacity to infect multiple hosts. Some examples include C. asianum, detected in infected chili, mango, and rose apple, and C. fructicola, a fungus initially reported to infect coffee berries, now recognized as a phytopathogen in other plant species, such as chili, citrus fruits, rose apple, avocado, grapes, and papaya.
Previous studies indicate cross-infection among different anthracnose pathogens, prior to systematic revisions of the Colletotrichum genus based on phylogenetic analysis of multiple markers. For instance, Freeman et al. (2001) showed that C. acutatum sensu lato isolated from strawberry is capable of infecting various fruit crops. Moreover, cross-infection studies by Sanders and Korsten (2003) demonstrated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides sensu lato from mango could infect and produce symptoms in guava, chili, and papaya. Therefore, cross-infection of tropical fruits by various Colletotrichum species can occur in the field. Likewise, anthracnose pathogens may infect the same fruit crop in different countries. It is crucial to accurately identify these pathogens and assign appropriate scientific names. Furthermore, understanding the lifestyle and mode of infection of each species is a key point in implementing suitable control measures. Additionally, a deeper knowledge of species distribution and population size can provide valuable insights into breeding strategies aimed at achieving durable resistance to anthracnose, as well as improving control methods.
A detailed description of the species of Colletotrichum associated with tropical fruit crops reveals various findings across several countries. For bananas, several species were reported, including C. paxtonii in St. Lucia and C. gloeosporioides sensu lato in Malaysia. In China, C. scovillei was noted, while multiple species, including C. siamense and C. tropicale, were documented in Brazil. The findings for mango highlighted numerous species, such as C. asianum and C. gloeosporioides in Panama, Sri Lanka, and various regions of Brazil and China. For papaya, C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici were found across locations like Mexico and Japan, with additional reports of other species in Brazil and Australia. Overall, the distribution of these pathogens underscores the importance of identifying the specific Colletotrichum species affecting tropical fruits in different geographical regions.
C. karstii is reported in India (Sharma and Shenoy, 2013). C. brevisporum is found in Brazil (Vieira et al., 2013). In India, C. fructicola and C. gloeosporioides were identified (Saini et al., 2016), while C. magnum was reported in Mexico (Tapia-Tussell et al., 2016). Other findings include C. salsolae in India (Saini et al., 2017), C. truncatum, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. magnum in Costa Rica (Molina-Chaves et al., 2017). C. brevisporum was noted in Taiwan (Duan et al., 2018), while C. truncatum was found in Korea (Aktaruzzaman et al., 2018). Taiwan also reported C. plurivorum (Sun et al., 2019) and C. brevisporum (Liu et al., 2019). C. truncatum was documented in Brazil (Vieira et al., 2017), and C. okinawense was identified in both Brazil (Dias et al., 2020) and Taiwan (Sun and Huang, 2020). In China, C. siamense was reported (Zhang et al., 2021).
For dragon fruits (Hylocereus spp.), C. gloeosporioides sensu lato was found in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan (Taba et al., 2006), and Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA (Palmateer et al., 2007). In Brazil, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato was reported (Takahashi et al., 2008), while Malaysia documented the same for H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and Selenicereus megalanthus (Masyahit et al., 2009). In China, C. gloeosporioides was found in young stems of H. undatus (Ma et al., 2014) and in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, C. truncatum was reported on H. undatus fruits (Guo et al., 2014). In Thailand, both C. aenigma and C. siamense were identified on H. undatus stem and fruit (Meetum et al., 2015). Malaysia reported C. truncatum on H. polyrhizus stem (Suzianti et al., 2015), while Taiwan found C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and C. boninense on H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and H. costaricensis (Lin et al., 2017). In China, C. siamense was documented on H. polyrhizus stem (Zhao et al., 2018) and on H. undatus in the Andaman Islands, India (Abirami et al., 2019). Lastly, C. karstii was reported on H. undatus stem in Brazil (Nascimento et al., 2019).
For guava (Psidium guajava L.), C. gloeospori
Due to the economic importance of anthracnose in the context of tropical fruit production and commercialization, this review focuses on the current knowledge regarding Colletotrichum species associated with tropical fruit crops reported in several fruit-producing countries. Emphasis is laid on Colletotrichum species associated with mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit because these fruit crops are cultivated in many tropical countries as an income source, contributing significantly to the economic well-being of their inhabitants.
Banana (Musa spp.) is one of the most important fruit crops and the most popular fruit consumed worldwide, with over 100 billion bananas eaten every year. More than 150 countries have banana plantations, mainly distributed in Asia, Latin America, and Africa. The largest banana producer is India, followed by China, the Philippines, Ecuador, and Brazil. International banana trade mainly involves the Cavendish type, which replaced the Gros Michel variety due to its resistance to Fusarium wilt. Currently, Cavendish is produced for export and local consumption worldwide in small farms as well as in extensive plantations.
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is an important postharvest disease of bananas. Colletotrichum species infect bananas in plantations and become latent pathogens. Bananas are often harvested before ripening; during storage, as the fruits ripen, anthracnose symptoms appear as brown or black lesions. Later, these lesions enlarge, become sunken, and produce spore masses. Wounds and scratches on banana peel caused by handling and transportation enhance the occurrence of anthracnose symptoms, which greatly impair the quality of bananas for export and local consumption. Colletotrichum musae has long been associated with banana anthracnose worldwide. In addition to anthracnose, C. musae can also cause stem-end, crown, and blossom-end rots in bananas. Since C. musae is prevalent in bananas, it has been suggested that this species might be host-specific to the plant. However, a detailed study on a global scale is required to confirm this hypothesis.
Researchers have developed C. musae species-specific primers for the rapid identification of this fungal species; this strategy results in cost savings compared to the sequencing of multiple genes. A study on mango anthracnose identified C. musae as one of the species involved, indicating that Colletotrichum species may not be host-specific to banana, as previously considered. Among the main banana-producing countries, detailed studies on anthracnose pathogens were only conducted in Brazil, where five species were found to be associated with the disease. Colletotrichum musae is still the most prevalent species reported in Brazil. Information regarding Colletotrichum spp. causing banana anthracnose in India, China, the Philippines, and Ecuador is rather scarce. The available data mainly consist of disease reports or newly recorded species; only one or two species are commonly reported to be involved. Colletotrichum species causing banana anthracnose in Brazil were found to be C. siamense, C. tropicale, C. chrysophilum, and C. theobromicola. Other species reported include C. scovillei in China, C. siamense in India and Turkey, C. gloeosporioides in Ecuador, and C. chrysophilum in Mexico. Additional reported species include C. paxtonii, C. karstii, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and an undescribed species assigned to the C. siamense sensu lato clade.
One of the possible reasons for the lack of comprehensive studies on banana anthracnose might be that many studies focus on other diseases affecting bananas that are known to cause significant yield losses, such as wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum Tropical Race 4 and Moko disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum.
Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is predominantly planted in Asia, particularly in India, which contributes to about 50% of the world’s mango production, followed by China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Indonesia. Brazil and Mexico are the largest mango producers in the Americas, while Nigeria and Egypt are major producers in Africa. For many of these countries, mango production is economically relevant. Almost all mango cultivars grown in these regions are susceptible to anthracnose due to the high temperature and humidity characteristic of tropical areas. The incidence of fruit anthracnose can reach nearly 100% under wet conditions. Not only the fruits but also the leaves, twigs, and flowers are affected by mango anthracnose. Leaf symptoms include black necrotic spots with irregular shapes on both sides of the leaves. Similar symptoms can appear on twigs and flowers. These black necrotic spots may merge to form larger infected areas. Infected tissues become dry, eventually leading to the death of the affected plant parts. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato is the main pathogen responsible for mango anthracnose worldwide. In some cases, C. acutatum sensu lato has also been associated with mango anthracnose. Phylogenetic analysis based solely on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences indicates that C. gloeosporioides consists of diverse groups or species sub-populations, suggesting that other Colletotrichum species might be linked to mango anthracnose. In contrast, several studies show that Colletotrichum isolates obtained from mango may consist of pathogenically and genetically distinct populations of C. gloeosporioides. According to Ploetz (1999), the C. gloeosporioides population on mango has a restricted host range and is highly virulent only on mango. Following reports by Phoulivong et al. (2012) and Weir et al. (2012) detailing phylogenetic analyses of the genus Colletotrichum using multiple markers, several species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes (including C. gloeosporioides) were identified as being associated with mango anthracnose. Comprehensive studies on mango anthracnose pathogens using multilocus phylogenetic analysis were conducted in Brazil by Lima et al. (2013) and Sharma et al. (2013), in South China by Mo et al. (2018), and in Mexico by Tovar-Pedraza et al. (2020). Other data on anthracnose-causing agents in mango have been reported as first reports or disease notes. In northeastern Brazil, five Colletotrichum species, namely C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. tropicale, C. karstii, and C. dianesei, were identified as
C. asianum and C. gloeosporioides have been identified as common mango anthracnose pathogens by Rojas et al. (2010) in Panama and by Krishnapillai and Wijeratnam (2014) in Sri Lanka. Many reports published in India, the largest mango producer in the world, indicate that C. gloeosporioides is the primary causative agent of mango anthracnose; however, this may not always be accurate. Chowdappa and Kumar (2012) reported that the C. gloeosporioides associated with mango anthracnose in India comprises diverse subgroups, based on restriction analysis and sequencing of the ITS region. Pathogenicity tests demonstrate variability in virulence among C. gloeosporioides isolates, suggesting the presence of multiple species responsible for the disease. Using multigene phylogenetic analysis, Sharma et al. (2013) identified four phylogenetic species: C. fragariae sensu stricto, C. fructicola, C. jasmine-sambac, and C. melanocaulon. Additionally, five Colletotrichum lineages without species names were linked to mango anthracnose in India. Sharma et al. (2013) also found that none of the Colletotrichum isolates from mango samples grouped with C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto, aligning with earlier findings by Phoulivong et al. (2012). A multigene phylogenetic analysis by Mo et al. (2018) in various regions of Guangxi, south China, revealed that three species of the C. gloeosporioides complex are pathogenic to mango fruits and leaves: C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense. Furthermore, Qin et al. (2017) identified C. scovillei, a species within the C. acutatum complex, as another anthracnose-causing pathogen in mango leaves in Guangxi, China. Among the species in the C. gloeosporioides complex, C. asianum is the most prevalent anthracnose pathogen affecting mangoes globally. This species has been reported in Brazil, Sri Lanka, Sanya City, and other regions of China, as well as South Africa, Malaysia, Taiwan, Mexico, the Philippines, and Indonesia. The identification of additional Colletotrichum spp. associated with mango anthracnose may stem from larger sampling areas, enabling the collection of more diseased mango individuals and the detection of more isolates. In southern China, a study by Li et al. (2019) on Colletotrichum spp. linked to mango anthracnose analyzed infected mangoes from six provinces: Fujian, Guangdong, Guizhou, Hainan, Sichuan, and Yunnan. This study identified 13 species associated with mango anthracnose, including C. asianum, C. cliviicola, C. cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. fructicola, C. gigasporum, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. musae, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. The two most common species identified were C. asianum and C. siamense, each accounting for 30% of the total species identified. Colletotrichum cordylinicola, C. endophytica, C. gigasporum, C. liaoningense, and C. musae were the first reported Colletotrichum spp. associated with mango anthracnose. Wu et al. (2020) reported on Colletotrichum spp. related to mango anthracnose in Taiwan, i
Pedraza et al. (2020) in Mexico identified five species using the mating type Mat1-20 (ApMat) marker: C. alienum, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. In terms of virulence, C. alienum and C. fructicola were the least virulent, while C. siamense and C. asianum were the most virulent. Some of these species, except C. alienum, have been reported as causal pathogens of mango anthracnose. Colletotrichum alienum was the first species reported to be associated with mango anthracnose worldwide at the time of publication. Later, Ahmad et al. (2021) reported that C. alienum was associated with anthracnose in mango fruits of the cv. Jin-Hwang in Beijing, China. To date, 17 species of Colletotrichum are associated with mango anthracnose worldwide. Using multiple markers for phylogenetic analysis suggests that more new species may be reported from other mango-producing countries.
Papaya (Carica papaya L.) is widely accepted to have originated in Central America and southern Mexico. This fruit crop is now commercially cultivated in many tropical countries, with India as the leading producer, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Dominican Republic. Other papaya-producing countries include Thailand, the Philippines, China, Peru, and Nigeria. Papaya is a climacteric fleshy fruit, typically harvested at the pre-climacteric stage, resulting in a short shelf life as ripening begins after harvest. Several fruit rot pathogens, including Colletotrichum spp., can damage the fruit during this period. Although papaya anthracnose symptoms may occur in both fruits and leaves, Colletotrichum infection is usually more severe in fruits. Refrigerated papayas are particularly susceptible, and fruits intended for export may develop anthracnose symptoms as they ripen.
Earlier studies, especially those conducted before the widespread application of multiple markers for identification, indicated C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici as common anthracnose pathogens in papaya across several regions, including the Yucatan Peninsula, Mexico; Malaysia; the Miyako Islands, Okinawa, Japan; South Florida; and Trinidad. In addition to C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici, C. dematium has been identified as a causative agent of papaya anthracnose in Yucatan, Mexico. Several species belonging to the C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, C. magnum, and C. orchidearum complexes have been reported to be associated with papaya anthracnose, indicating that multiple Colletotrichum species are involved. Since C. capsici is now considered a synonym of C. truncatum, the former name is less frequently used in recent publications.
In Australia, C. acutatum, C. simmondsii, and C. queenslandicum have been described on papaya, while C. siamense has been reported in South Africa and China. In India, multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has identified several species as papaya anthracnose pathogens, including C. karstii, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and C. salsolae. Most of these species are not host-specific and can be found in many papaya-producing countries. Three species—C. magna, C. gloeosporioides, and C. brevisporum—have been reported as causative agents of papaya fruit rot and anthracnose in Brazil. Although Nascimento et al. (2010) referred to the disease as papaya fruit rot, Colletotrichum spp. were isolated from lesions with typical anthracnose symptoms, sometimes described as chocolate spots. Colletotrichum karstii has also been reported from papaya. Papaya anthracnose caused by C. truncatum and C. okinawense was reported by Vieira et al. (2020) and Dias et al. (2020), respectively, marking these spe
Colletotrichum brevisporum and C. plurivorum have also been reported as pathogens of papaya anthracnose in Taiwan. These pathogens were recovered from anthracnose lesions found on papaya fruits. In addition to Taiwan and Brazil, C. brevisporum was also identified as a causal pathogen of papaya anthracnose in China. Another species, C. okinawense, first reported in Brazil, was found to be associated with papaya anthracnose in Taiwan. Colletotrichum magnum was identified as a causative agent of papaya anthracnose in Mexico and Costa Rica. Using the ITS region and specific primers, Molina-Chaves et al. (2017) depicted C. truncatum, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. magnum as pathogens of papaya anthracnose in Guácimo, Costa Rica. Colletotrichum truncatum has also been reported as a cause of papaya anthracnose in Korea. Comprehensive studies focusing on the causative pathogens of papaya anthracnose are still lacking. Most available studies are either first disease reports or disease notes. A study on genetic variation in C. magnum was conducted by Pérez-Brito et al. (2018) as an attempt to understand pathogenicity patterns and responses to different fungicides. One reason for the lack of comprehensive studies on papaya anthracnose may be the occurrence of viral and bacterial diseases in papaya under field conditions, which frequently results in plant decay and decreased yields. Among viral diseases, papaya ringspot caused by the Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV) is the most serious and has been detected in many papaya-producing countries in the tropics, as well as in subtropical areas. Regarding bacterial diseases, papaya dieback is very destructive; and 100% yield losses have been recorded in Malaysia due to this pathogen. In studies on control methods for papaya anthracnose, C. gloeosporioides is widely used as the causal pathogen. This should be approached with caution, as there are several other Colletotrichum species within the C. gloeosporioides complex associated with papaya anthracnose.
Dragon fruit (Hylocereus sp.) is believed to have originated in Central and South America and is now widely cultivated in many countries, including Vietnam, China, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, and the United States. China has also initiated large-scale planting of dragon fruit, with 20,000 hectares distributed in Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Currently, the main dragon fruit producer is Vietnam, followed by Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Australia, and Israel. In South America, dragon fruit is cultivated in Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Guatemala. Two common species of cultivated dragon fruits are Hylocereus polyrhizus (red-fleshed) and Hylocereus undatus (white-fleshed). The name "dragon fruit" likely derives from the fruit's appearance, characterized by the presence of bracts or scales on the outer part. This fruit is also known by various local names, including strawberry pear or night-blooming cereus (in English-speaking regions), pitahaya (in Latin America), buah naga or buah mata naga (in Malaysia), thanh long (in Vietnam), kaeo mangkon or luk mangkon (in Thailand), päniniokapunahou or päpipi pua (in Hawaii), and paw wong fa kor (in China). Dragon fruit is often consumed fresh; its white, purple, or red flesh has a sweet taste, especially the red-fleshed variety. Bes
Dragon fruit anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum affects the stems and fruits of Hylocereus spp. In earlier studies, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has been reported as the most common anthracnose pathogen in Hylocereus megalanthus in Brazil, while H. undatus is commonly found in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, and in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been identified as an anthracnose-causing pathogen affecting the stems and fruits of H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and Selenicereus megalanthus in Malaysia. Using only ITS sequences, Lin et al. (2017) identified three species, C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and C. boninense, as anthracnose agents in H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and H. costaricensis plants growing in several counties in Taiwan. After applying multiple markers for the identification of Colletotrichum species, several members within the C. gloeosporioides complex have been reported as anthracnose pathogens in Hylocereus spp. Ma et al. (2014) reported C. gloeosporioides as an anthracnose pathogen in the young stems of H. undatus in China. In a later study, Zhao et al. (2018) found C. siamense to be the causative agent of stem anthracnose in H. polyrhizus in China. Additionally, C. aenigma and C. siamense are reported to be associated with stem and fruit anthracnose in H. undatus grown in Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Sakhon, Thailand. Colletotrichum siamense is also responsible for fruit anthracnose in H. undatus growing in the Andaman Islands, India. In Brazil, C. karstii has been reported as the causal pathogen of H. undatus stem anthracnose. Besides species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, C. truncatum is also noted as an anthracnose pathogen in Hylocereus spp. Colletotrichum truncatum is the causative agent of H. polyrhizus stem anthracnose in Malaysia, and H. undatus was also reported in fruits sold in a market in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, China. Seven Colletotrichum species have been identified as causal anthracnose pathogens of different types of dragon fruits. However, information on anthracnose pathogens associated with fruits and stems in several main producing countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, is still lacking.
Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is grown for its edible fruits, which are rich in vitamin C and dietary fiber. Guava fruits are consumed fresh or processed into products such as purées, jams, marmalades, jellies, fruit pastes, juice, syrup, candy, and chutneys. Additionally, guava leaves are used in folk medicine due to their properties that are bene
All guava-growing areas around the world are subjected to guava anthracnose. The fungi responsible for this disease infect guava fruits during pre- and post-harvest stages, particularly during periods of high rainfall and humidity. Young guava flowers and developing fruits may also be infected. Anthracnose symptoms are evident in mature fruits both in the field and in harvested fruits. Similar to what is observed in other fruit crops, symptoms of guava anthracnose primarily consist of sunken, dark necrotic lesions on the fruit surface. Under humid conditions, spore masses are formed in these lesions. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has been reported as a common anthracnose pathogen in several guava-growing countries. In Hawaii, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been found to infect guava leaves. Research indicates that C. gloeosporioides sensu lato is the most prevalent species causing anthracnose disease in guava fruit, though other species from the C. gloeosporioides complex may also be associated with this disease. Colletotrichum acutatum has also been noted to cause anthracnose in guava. Recent studies on gene phylogeny for identifying Colletotrichum species indicate that several species belonging to the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes are associated with guava anthracnose. Among the species from the C. acutatum complex, C. simmondsii has been detected in Brazil, C. abscissum in Brazil and the USA, and C. guajavae in India. Regarding the C. gloeosporioides complex associated with guava, C. psidii was found in Italy and C. siamense in India. A pathogenicity study revealed that C. nymphaeae, isolated from apple fruits in Brazil, could cause lesions on guava fruits, demonstrating the cross-pathogenicity of this species. In summary, multiple Colletotrichum species are linked to guava anthracnose. This information may aid in developing integrated disease management strategies to control guava anthracnose, as some involved species have a wide host range.
Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a common tropical fruit that originated in Central America, specifically in Mexico and Guatemala. Mexico is the leading producer and exporter of avocado, followed by the Netherlands, Peru, Spain, Chile, and Colombia. Other countries producing avocados include India, Indonesia, Israel, China, Kenya, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand. Avocado is a rich source of nutrients, particularly fatty acids such as oleic and palmitic acids, minerals, and vitamins. It also contains phytochemicals like tannins, alkaloids, phenols, saponins, flavonoids, and lutein, the predominant carotenoid in avocado fruits. Due to these compounds and many other phytochemicals, avocado exhibits numerous medicinal properties, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antihypoglycemic, antihypertensive, antihepatotoxic, anticonvulsant, and vasorelaxant effects. Anthracnose can occur in avocado wherever this fruit is grown, especially during the wet season and in high rainfall areas. Major infections typically affect the fruit, but leaves and stems can also become infected. The dark lesions of varying sizes produced by anthracnose pathogens tend to expand rapidly on the fruit skin and can infect the pulp, leading to rot. Prior to the application of multiple gene phylogeny for identifying Colletotrichum species, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato was the most frequently found species as
C. gloeosporioides was reported as the causative agent of avocado fruit anthracnose in Mexico, Mersin Province in Turkey, and Ghana. Hunupolagama et al. (2015) identified C. gigasporum as a causative agent of avocado anthracnose in Sri Lanka based on four markers: ITS, actin (ACT), GAPDH, and β-tubulin. In Mexico, two species, C. godetiae and C. karstii, were identified as anthracnose pathogens on avocado, both identified using ITS and GAPDH sequences. A comprehensive study on Colletotrichum spp. associated with avocado anthracnose was conducted in Israel. Using multiple genes and markers (ITS, ACT, ApMat, calmodulin [CAL], chitin synthase [CHS1], GAPDH, GS, HIS3, and β-tubulin), Sharma et al. (2017) identified nine Colletotrichum species. Eight of these species—C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto, C. karstii, C. nupharicola, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola—had been previously reported as avocado anthracnose pathogens in other avocado-producing countries. A new species, C. perseae, was reported in association with avocado anthracnose for the first time. While C. aenigma is the most virulent species in Israel, C. perseae sp. nov. is considered the most dominant. Other studies conducted in different avocado-producing countries reported either the same species or different Colletotrichum species identified by Sharma et al. (2017) to be responsible for avocado anthracnose. Fuentes-Aragón et al. (2018) reported C. fructicola as the causal pathogen of avocado anthracnose in Hidalgo, Mexico, and Giblin et al. (2018) isolated and identified five species previously considered as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato from avocado fruit in eastern Australia: C. alienum, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. siamense. Shivas et al. (2016) also reported the presence of C. alienum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense in avocado in Australia. Kwon et al. (2020) identified C. kahawae subsp. cigarro as the isolate obtained from an imported avocado variety in a market in Jinju, South Korea. Uysal and Kurt (2020) reported C. karstii as the causal pathogen of avocado fruit and leaf anthracnose in Turkey. In southeastern Brazil, C. siamense and C. karstii were found to be associated with avocado anthracnose. Another comprehensive study on the pathogens of avocado anthracnose was performed by Fuentes-Aragón et al. (2020). Using six markers (GAPDH, ITS, ACT, CHS-1, ApMat, and β-tubulin), the study indicated that 11 species were the causal pathogens of avocado anthracnose in Mexico: C. karstii, C. godetiae, C. siamense, C. fioriniae, C. cigarro, C. chrysophilum, C. jiangxiense, C. tropicale, C. n
Fungicides, chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have long been used to effectively control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants. Benzimidazoles are often applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp., but large-scale and continuous fungicide use has led to fungal resistance. For example, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangos and bananas. The excessive use of fungicides also negatively affects human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate the soil and water.
Biocontrol is an alternative, non-toxic method for controlling fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, which include antagonistic microbes such as yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity due to their direct post-harvest application to fruit surfaces. Yeasts, being unicellular fungi, have several characteristics that make them desirable biocontrol agents. They grow rapidly on a wide range of substrates, have a high reproductive rate, and possess simple nutritional requirements. Moreover, yeasts are not mycotoxigenic and can thrive in high-sugar environments. There is also an increasing demand for chemical-free or reduced chemical treatments to control anthracnose, leading to the development of alternative methods that are safer for consumers, such as edible coatings from chitosan and essential oils.
Generally recognized as safe (GRAS) salt treatments, nanomaterials, and cold plasma technology have also been explored. Often, these alternative approaches are used in combination for more effective inhibition of anthracnose pathogen growth and reduction of disease severity. Chitosan has emerged as a target for edible coating formulations due to its antifungal properties and is often combined with other compounds, such as essential oils. The antifungal efficacy of chitosan in solution (conventional chitosan) and chitosan in submicron dispersion has been tested against C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, a dragon fruit anthracnose pathogen. When applied to the fruit, the chitosan treatments reduced anthracnose symptoms and disease development.
Combining chitosan with Cymbopogon citratus essential oil also exhibits inhibitory effects against five anthracnose pathogens (C. asianum, C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. tropicale, and C. karstii) when inoculated on guava, mango, and papaya. Additionally, a combination of chitosan and peppermint essential oils (Mentha piperita L. and Mentha x villosa Huds) has shown growth inhibition of anthracnose pathogens (C. gloeosporioides and C. brevisporum) on papaya in vitro and reduced anthracnose lesions after 10 days of storage. GRAS inorganic and organic salts, used to preserve food, have been evaluated as edible coatings for anthracnose pathogen control and to reduce fruit rot. Carbonates, sorbates, benzoates, and silicates, which have low toxicological effects and antifungal properties, have shown
C. capsici spore germination. Moreover, when the fruit was placed in a potassium sorbate and hot water solution (55 °C for 5 min) and then cooled in water, the disease severity was reduced without affecting the fruit quality. Kalupahana et al. (2020) tested the effectiveness of sodium bicarbonate and sodium metabisulfite against the mango anthracnose pathogen, C. siamense, and found that both salts inhibited mycelial growth. Nanomaterials, such as copper, silver, nickel, and magnesium, have antifungal properties and may be effective at managing anthracnose pathogens and post-harvest diseases. The efficacy of zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, and their composites (52–219 nm) was tested against papaya and avocado C. gloeosporioides. Conidial germination was inhibited, and the fungal cells were damaged, indicating that the nanomaterials had an antifungal effect. This was supported by Jagana et al. (2017), who reported that copper, silver, nickel, and magnesium (68 nm) extracted from the leaves of the medicinal plants ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) and neem (Azadirachta indica) inhibited the spore germination of C. musae isolated from banana. The severity of banana anthracnose was also reduced with 0.2% silver-neem. Nanomaterial composites with other materials can also control mango anthracnose. Antifungal properties were reported when chitosan-silver composite (495–616 nm diameter) was used, which suppressed C. gloeosporioides conidial germination. An in-vivo study reported that 0.5% and 1% nanomaterial composite reduced anthracnose disease by 45.7% and 71.3%, respectively. Neem extract was used to synthesize copper oxychloride conjugated silver (21–25 nm) and treat C. gloeosporioides, resulting in pathogen growth suppression. Cold plasma technology is another approach to inhibit anthracnose pathogens in tropical fruit. Cold plasma is a partially ionized gas, where a small subset of atoms and molecules are ionized by electrical discharges at atmospheric or sub-atmospheric pressure. Studies using cold plasma technology have been performed on spoilage and mycotoxigenic fungi-contaminated food and feed with promising outcomes. Siddique et al. (2018) isolated C. alienum and C. fioriniae from avocados and treated them with cold plasma for 180 s or 360 s in open and sealed environments. In some treatments, the colony growth was reduced, and the conidial germination was inhibited, suggesting that cold plasma treatment may be an effective control for C. alienum and C. fioriniae in avocado. Cold plasma has also been used to decontaminate fruit containers and packaging. Misra et al. (2014) used two gas mixtures (65% O2 + 16% N2 + 19% CO2 and 90% N2 + 10% O2) to decontaminate packaged and sealed strawberries, which reduced the microflora level from 5 to 3.0 log10 CFU/g in 300 s with no post-treatment changes to the packaging material. Alternative methods to reduce post-harvest fruit crop losses are ongoing. Biocontrol agents, edible fruit coatings, and GRAS salt, cold plasma, and nanomaterial treatments have shown promising results, but they are not w
Various Colletotrichum species can cause anthracnose in tropical fruit crops, becoming serious limiting factors in the production and marketing of these commodities. Several species of Colletotrichum are associated with anthracnose in banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado. Some of these species not only infect the fruits but also the stems and leaves, indicating that other parts of the plants can harbor inoculum sources for anthracnose infection on fruit crops. Species such as C. siamense, C. asianum, C. scovillei, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. fructicola, and C. tropicale can infect multiple hosts, demonstrating the possibility of cross-infection among various types of fruit crops as well as other crops. Since molecular phylogenetic analysis has been applied for the identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species, a diverse array of species has been reported to be associated with anthracnose in tropical fruits. Many of these species belong to different species complexes, including C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. boninense complexes. Species within a complex are closely related and exhibit similar behaviors in host infection and colonization. Therefore, the infection and colonization of various Colletotrichum species on different tropical fruit crops are also similar. In terms of virulence, anthracnose symptoms can vary among different fruits depending on factors such as fruit variety, inoculum concentration, humidity, and temperature. Furthermore, pathogenic variation among Colletotrichum species infecting fruit crops has been demonstrated.
Diverse species of Colletotrichum causing anthracnose in fruit crops also pose a quarantine concern. Banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado are exported and imported worldwide, and latent infection is part of the disease cycle of anthracnose pathogens. There is a possibility that anthracnose pathogens can spread to other areas or regions. Therefore, documenting all Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose in different types of fruit crops is crucial. Accurate identification and scientific naming of anthracnose pathogens are vital, as precise taxonomic information enables classification of a given species as a pathogen, saprophyte, or endophyte. The species involved in anthracnose of tropical fruits may also present differently. Effective disease management often depends on the proper identification of the causative pathogen. The use of multiple markers has facilitated the recognition of an increasing number of Colletotrichum phylogenetic species, including those that cause anthracnose. However, for some of these phylogenetic species, information on host range, pathogenicity, virulence variability, sensitivity to fungicides, and geographical distribution remains scarce. This situation can pose challenges for plant pathologists, as many members of Colletotrichum are among the fungal species of quarantine concern in several countries. Keeping up to date with recently reported Colletotrichum species affecting tropical fruit crops is essential for identifying the risks they pose.
A detailed description of the table regarding the diversity of Colletotrichum species and the infected plant parts indicates that different fruit crops are affected by specific Colletotrichum species. For instance, in bananas, several species like C. scovillei and C. gloeosporioides predominantly infect the fruit, while C. musae has been reported in ripe fruit as well as in leaves and roots. In mangoes, species such as C. fructicola and C. tropicale infect both fruits and leaves, demonstrating the varied impacts of these pathogens across different parts of the plants.
C. gloeosporioides is associated with various parts of different fruits and plants. For example, in papaya (Carica papaya L.), it affects the fruit, leaves, and inflorescence. In dragon fruits (Hylocereus spp.), the pathogen impacts the fruit and stem. Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is affected in its fruit and leaves by C. gloeosporioides and other species like C. psidii. Similarly, in avocado (Persea americana Mill.), it influences the fruit along with several other Colletotrichum species.

C. gloeosporioides affects various plant parts such as fruits, leaves, and inflorescences in papaya (Carica papaya L.). Other species like C. magna, C. dematium, C. acutatum, C. simmondsii, C. karstii, C. queenslandicum, C. siamense, C. salsolae, C. magnum, C. brevisporum, C. fructicola, C. plurivorum, C. okinawense are associated with dragon fruits (Hylocereus spp.), primarily affecting the fruit. C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. truncatum impact the fruit and stem, while C. gloeosporioides targets the young stem and fruit in guava (Psidium guajava L.). Additional species affecting guava include C. psidii, C. guajavae, and C. abscissum. Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is influenced by C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, C. nymphaeae, C. gigasporum, C. karstii, C. godetiae, C. alienum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and others, with various parts like fruit and leaves being affected.
