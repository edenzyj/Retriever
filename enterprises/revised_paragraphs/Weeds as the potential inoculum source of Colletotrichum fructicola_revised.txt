This study, authored by Yoshihiko Hirayama, Shunsuke Asano, Ken’o Okayama, Satoshi T. Ohki, and Motoaki Tojo, investigates the role of weeds as potential sources of the fungal pathogen Colletotrichum fructicola, which is responsible for anthracnose disease in strawberries. The research highlights the importance of understanding the ecological relationships between weeds and the pathogens affecting agricultural crops.
The article was received on March 7, 2017, accepted on September 16, 2017, and published online on November 14, 2017. The findings contribute to the body of knowledge regarding plant-pathogen interactions and suggest that managing weed populations may be crucial for controlling anthracnose in strawberry production systems.
Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent among anthracnose pathogens of strawberry in Nara, Japan. We hypothesized that a wide range of weeds growing in and around strawberry fields are inoculum sources of the disease and investigated their potential as hosts of C. fructicola. We also examined the influence of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on weeds. The fungus was detected on 31 of 541 (5.7%) leaves sampled from 13 weed species from 2005 to 2008. The fungus was most frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, with an isolation frequency of 17.9%; inoculation of A. blitum with the pathogen caused brown leaf spots. Other weeds such as Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Solidago altissima, Erigeron annuus, and Sonchus oleraceus were found to harbor the fungus at lower rates (4.3–8.1%) without symptoms. C. fructicola formed acervuli on leaves of A. blitum, D. ciliaris, and S. oleraceus after plants were killed by glyphosate herbicide. These results demonstrated that infected weeds associated with strawberry cultivation are potential inoculum sources of C. fructicola, especially after herbicide treatment.

Introduction
Anthracnose is the most severe disease of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) (Freeman and Katan 1997; Nam et al. 2004; Peres et al. 2005; Van Hemelrijck et al. 2010). The disease occurred extensively in the late 1970s in western Japan, including Nara, and it still remains a serious problem for strawberry growers (Hirayama et al. 2016; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994). Most of the commonly grown strawberry cultivars are susceptible (Mori 1998), and the emergence of fungicide-resistant strains hinders disease control (Inada et al. 2010). The use of infected runner plantlets also contributes to disease epidemics (Hirayama et al. 2010). Colletotrichum fructicola Prihastuti, L. Cai, and K. D. Hyde has recently been identified as one of the main causal agents of strawberry anthracnose in Nara and Chiba prefectures, Japan (Gan et al. 2017). C. fructicola, as well as other strawberry anthracnose pathogens, occurs primarily in nurseries and latently infects runner plantlets, resulting in the transmission of the disease from the nursery to production fields (Debodea et al. 2015; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994). Thus, eradicating the pathogen from nurseries is essential to prevent disease incidence and has been accomplished using a practical system combined with detection assays for the pathogen (Hirayama et al. 2015; Suzuki et al. 2008) and elimination from infected plants (Hirayama et al. 2010). However, thorough eradication of the pathogen from nurseries does not always lead to complete disease control. Preliminary surveys in infested fields revealed that weeds were present in the vicinity of diseased strawberry plants (Hirayama et al. 2007). Colletotrichum species from strawberry are known to be pathogenic on cultivated and non-cultivated plants, including weeds (Howard and Albregts 1973; MacKenzie et al. 2007; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994; Whiting and Roncadori 1997; Xiao et al. 2004).

Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds, another major strawberry anthracnose pathogen, latently colonizes weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., as well as crops like pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean (Freeman et al. 2001). However, the latent infection of weeds by C. fructicola has never been studied in terms of the disease's epidemiology. We also suspected that herbicide sprays predisposed weeds to the development of C. fructicola. In fact, acervuli of C. truncatum developed more rapidly on herbicide-treated plants than on untreated plants (Cerkauskas et al. 1983). The purpose of this study was to examine weeds as a potential inoculum source of C. fructicola. We focused on (1) isolating the pathogen from several weed species in and around strawberry fields; (2) determining the pathogenicity and infectivity of the pathogen on the weed species; and (3) clarifying the growth of the pathogen on weeds treated with the herbicide glyphosate.
Materials and methods
Detection of the anthracnose fungus from weeds
A total of 541 weed leaves were collected from 12 strawberry nurseries in Nara from 2005 to 2008. Leaf samples were cleaned in running tap water for 3 minutes, surface-sterilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol for a few seconds and in 2% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 minutes, then rinsed with sterilized distilled water. They were air-dried for 1 hour and then placed on modified Mathur’s medium, which contained 1% (w/v) yeast extract, 0.1% (w/v) bactopeptone, 1% (w/v) sucrose, 0.25% (w/v) MgSO4·7H2O, 0.27% (w/v) KH2PO4, 2% (w/v) agar, 2.5 mg a.i. of iprodione (Rovral WP, Bayer CropScience, Tokyo, Japan), 0.1% (v/v) lactic acid, and 25 mg ampicillin in 1 L of distilled water. After incubation at 25 °C for 7 days in darkness, Colletotrichum colonies were selected based on microscopic characters. Single-spore cultures of Colletotrichum spp. were then initiated by streaking spores onto water agar. We revisited the nurseries to investigate disease occurrence in the next cultivation season.
Molecular identification of the causal fungus
Colletotrichum isolates from weeds were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco, Detroit, USA) for 7 days to obtain mycelia, and DNA was extracted from each mycelial sample using the CTAB method. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR) using species-specific primers was conducted to identify the species of Colletotrichum. The primer pairs used were CgInt and universal ITS4 primer for the C. gloeosporioides complex, and CaInt2 and universal ITS4 primer for C. acutatum. PCR was performed using a GeneAmp 9700 thermocycler in a 20 μL reaction mixture, containing 10–100 ng of genomic DNA, 2 × GoTaq Master Mix, and 10 pmol of each primer. The amplification protocol consisted of denaturation at 95 °C for 10 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, 58 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 1 minute; and a final extension at 72 °C for 7 minutes. Amplification products were electrophoresed in 1.5% agarose gels to detect specific reactions under UV light after staining with SYBR gold. Isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex were further identified to the species level by PCR using the Marker 2 primer pair. PCR and the detection of amplicons were conducted as above, except for the PCR conditions, which involved denaturation at 95 °C for 10 minutes, followed by 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 minute, 55 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 30 seconds; and a final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes.
Pathogenicity of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex isolates to strawberry.
Strawberry plants were inoculated with Colletotrichum isolates from weeds identified as species of the C. gloeosporioides complex to confirm pathogenicity. Conidia formed on 7-day-old PDA cultures were suspended in sterile distilled water and adjusted to 10^6 conidia/mL. Ten microliters of the conidial suspension was dropped on intact leaflets of strawberry cv. Asukaruby. Sterile water was dropped on the leaflets as the control. Plants were then covered with plastic bags to maintain 100% humidity and grown at 25 °C in ambient light. Isolates eliciting symptoms on more than two-thirds of the inoculated leaflets were judged as pathogenic. The experiment was conducted using two leaflets on each of three plants for each isolate.
The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates on weeds was tested using several weed species, including Amaranthus blitum, Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Sonchus oleraceus, and Portulaca oleracea. The weed seedlings at the 3- to 5-leaf stage of growth were collected from a field where strawberries had not been previously cultivated and were transplanted to 300-mL plastic pots containing nursery soil. The collected plants were confirmed to be C. fructicola-free using Mathur’s medium. Asukaruby strawberry plants with three leaves were used as a control. Colletotrichum fructicola isolates Nara-gc5 and 19002 from strawberry were used, which were naturally resistant to benomyl on Mathur’s medium. The C. fructicola isolates were cultured in 200 mL Erlenmeyer flasks each containing 100 mL of potato sucrose broth on a rotary shaker at 120 rpm at 25 °C for 10 days.
The results showed the detection of Colletotrichum fructicola from various weeds in and around strawberry fields. For instance, in a survey conducted in November 2005, several weed species were sampled, with a total of 60 leaves collected. The detection frequency of C. fructicola and the C. gloeosporioides complex varied, with some locations showing significant pathogenic isolates. The data revealed that in some cases, disease was present the following season, indicating the potential for these weeds to serve as reservoirs for the pathogen. Over the years, various sites were assessed, noting the presence and frequency of these fungal species, which highlighted their impact on local strawberry cultivation.

Conidia were collected by passing through sterile cheesecloth and suspended in sterile water, adjusting the concentration to 10^6 conidia/mL. Each potted plant received 10 mL of the conidial suspension using a hand sprayer and was covered with plastic bags to maintain 100% humidity. The control group received sterile water sprayed on the leaves. Anthracnose symptoms were recorded, and infection confirmation was done using Mathur’s medium seven days post-inoculation. The experiment was replicated three times with three plants per replicate.
Weeds infected with Colletotrichum fructicola isolates, specifically Amaranthus blitum and D. ciliaris—common weeds in and around strawberry fields—were collected for inoculation experiments to examine latent infections. Weed seedlings were transplanted into pots as previously described. Asukaruby strawberry plants at the three-leaf stage served as controls. The plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. fructicola isolate Nara-gc5, with the conidial density adjusted to 10^3 conidia/mL. Inoculated plants were kept in a greenhouse and watered twice daily via drip irrigation. Leaves were sampled at 0, 2, 4, 6, and 8 weeks after inoculation, with nine leaves from each plant species randomly sampled at each time point. Leaves were surface-sterilized, air-dried for one hour, and divided into eight equal segments, which were then placed on modified Mathur’s medium and incubated in the dark at 25 °C for seven days. The percentage of latent infection was calculated based on the number of leaf segments exhibiting mycelial growth. This experiment was repeated three times using one plant per repetition.
The influence of glyphosate on conidial formation by Colletotrichum fructicola isolates on weeds was evaluated. The effect of the herbicide was measured based on the fungus's conidial production capacity on glyphosate-treated plants. A benomyl-resistant isolate, Nara-gc5, of C. fructicola was used to inoculate A. blitum, D. ciliaris, S. oleraceus, and Asukaruby strawberry plants. The conditions for growth and inoculation were consistent with previous descriptions. Two weeks after inoculation, each plant was sprayed with 1 mL of glyphosate potassium (5.0 g a.i./L, Roundup Maxload). Control plants were treated with water instead of the herbicide. Seven days post-herbicide treatment, leaves were removed, cut into 1 cm² pieces, and five leaf pieces were vortexed in 10 mL of sterilized distilled water for two minutes. The resulting suspension was spread on plates containing modified Mathur’s medium with benomyl (50 mg a.i./L) to limit colony size, then incubated in the dark at 25 °C for seven days. The number of C. fructicola conidia was determined based on the colony-forming units (CFUs). The pathogen was distinguished from any contaminating fungi by its benomyl resistance on the modified Mathur’s medium. This experiment was repeated five times with five plates per treatment. Confirmation of conidia formation on leaves as C. fructicola was also done through microscopic observations.
Results indicated that Colletotrichum fructicola was detected in 31 of 541 (5.7%) leaves from 13 weed species between 2005 and 2008. Single-spore cultures of C. fructicola isolates were initiated from these 31 individual leaves, and four representative isolates were deposited at the NARO Gene Bank-Microorganisms Section as MAFF 246279 to 246282.
The presence of the pathogen on weeds tended to lead to diseased strawberries during the next cultivation season. The detection frequency of the C. gloeosporioides complex, including C. fructicola, was 15.9% (detected leaves/tested leaves). All the isolates proved to be members of the C. gloeosporioides complex by PCR using species-specific primers. All C. fructicola isolates caused typical disease symptoms on strawberry plants, but control plants did not develop any symptoms. Isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex other than C. fructicola were not pathogenic on strawberry. Among weed species, A. blitum was most frequently infected (17.9%) by C. fructicola. The following weeds showed relatively low detection rates (4.3–8.1%) without symptoms: D. ciliaris, G. ciliata, S. altissima, E. annuus, and S. oleraceus. Colletotrichum fructicola was not isolated from the remaining seven species: Senecio vulgaris L., Cyperus microiria Steud., Lamium amplexicaule L., Portulaca oleracea L., Alopecurus aequalis Sobol., Capsella bursa-pastoris Medicus, and Cerastium glomeratum Thuill. Colletotrichum fructicola tended to be isolated from warm-season weeds more frequently than from cool-season weeds.
Plants were inspected for anthracnose symptoms 7 days after inoculation. Brown leaf spots on A. blitum caused by inoculation with C. fructicola differed from the typical symptoms caused on strawberry plants. The pathogen was reisolated from leaves with brown leaf spots. No symptoms developed on other weed species, including D. ciliaris, G. ciliata, S. oleraceus, and P. oleracea. No symptoms developed on negative control plants sprayed with sterile water.
Amaranthus blitum and strawberry retained a high level of infection, ranging between 80% and 100% throughout the experiment; however, the infection rate of D. ciliaris decreased with time to approximately 20% within 8 weeks. Although strawberry had slightly black leaf spots, neither weed showed any symptoms.
All plants were dead by 7 days after glyphosate treatment. The number of C. fructicola conidia was significantly higher on glyphosate-treated leaves than on untreated leaves in all the plants tested. Acervuli formation was observed microscopically on glyphosate-treated leaves in all plants 7 days after the treatment.
Anthracnose caused by C. fructicola is one of the most destructive diseases of strawberry in Nara, Japan. The disease has often been observed on strawberry plants adjacent to weeds. The present study demonstrated that at least six of 13 species of weeds were infected by C. fructicola. Of the six weeds, five were warm-season weeds. Amaranthus blitum, which is one of the most common warm-season weeds in Nara, was most frequently infected by C. fructicola and often developed leaf spots. Five other weeds were less frequently infected and did not show visible symptoms. Colletotrichum fructicola is active under warm conditions; therefore, warm-season weeds may have a high potential for pathogen activity. Among the warm-season weeds, A. blitum was regarded as most likely to harbor the inoculum of C. fructicola in Nara Prefecture.
Inoculation tests of weeds with Colletotrichum fructicola suggested that the pathogen can survive latently on most weeds. Colletotrichum acutatum, another strawberry anthracnose pathogen, invades the intercellular space of infected tissues of pepper plants without any visible damage (Horowitz et al. 2002). The fungus forms secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves, increasing the number of conidia threefold (Leandro et al. 2001). Colletotrichum fructicola may similarly produce more conidia during latent infection in weeds. The pathogen could increase in strawberry fields without being noticeable because latently infected weeds are difficult to detect visually. Strawberry growers have never recognized nonsymptomatic weeds as significant inoculum sources. These latently infected weeds should thus be emphasized as important inoculum sources of C. fructicola.
The present results showed that weeds infected by Colletotrichum fructicola fall into three groups based on their susceptibility. The first group, including A. blitum, is always susceptible to the pathogen. The second group, including D. ciliaris, rapidly decreases in susceptibility to C. fructicola infection and does not develop symptoms. The third group, including Cyperus microiria, is resistant or immune to C. fructicola and does not appear to be sources of C. fructicola inoculum. Members of the second group can act as C. fructicola inoculum sources under herbicide-treated conditions because they produce abundant conidia after being killed by the herbicide, although susceptibility varies among the weed species. The conidia of strawberry anthracnose pathogens are known to be waterborne via rain and/or overhead irrigation (Ntahimpera et al. 1999). Okayama (1994) reported that the conidia dispersed more than 3 m when it rained heavily, leading to disease development on leaflets and petioles. Therefore, conidia that formed abundantly on herbicide-treated weeds are also likely to be dispersed to strawberry plants.
The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola isolates to weeds showed varied symptoms. For Amaranthus blitum, both Isolate Nara-gc5 and Isolate 19002 caused brown leaf spots, while Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, and Sonchus oleraceus showed no symptoms. Portulaca oleracea also displayed no symptoms. In contrast, Fragaria × ananassa (strawberry) exhibited black leaf spots or lesions on leaflets and petioles for both isolates. The percentage infection in Amaranthus blitum and Digitaria ciliaris was based on the number of leaf pieces with the fungus out of the total sampled. Necrotic leaf spots with C. fructicola acervuli present on strawberry were used as a control. The experiment was repeated three times using one plant per repetition. Asterisks indicated a significant difference from strawberry (χ² test, P < 0.05), with bars representing standard error.
Sonchus oleraceus and strawberry were studied to determine the number of conidia using the dilution plate method with modified Mathur’s medium. Asterisks indicate significant differences from untreated control leaves (χ² test, P < 0.05). Error bars represent standard error.
The acervulus of Colletotrichum fructicola formed on the leaf of Amaranthus blitum seven days after treatment with glyphosate was stained with aniline blue (bar 50 μm). This led to epidemics of strawberry anthracnose throughout the nursery. In traditional strawberry production systems, plants are grown in the ground, making crop rotation essential. However, recent cultivation methods involve continuous cropping on elevated benches to enhance production efficiency. This continuous cropping system usually increases weed populations and necessitates intensive herbicide applications, which can elevate the risk of disease spread from weeds to strawberries. The present study found that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during subsequent cultivation seasons. While many sources of C. fructicola can cause disease in following strawberry crops, increases in the pathogen on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.
In conclusion, this study highlighted the potential importance of weeds as an inoculum source of C. fructicola and clarified the risks associated with herbicide treatments on weeds and inoculum production. The elimination of pathogens from infected mother plants and the removal of plant residues are critical for controlling strawberry anthracnose. Furthermore, this study demonstrated that effective weed control is vital to minimize primary infections of strawberry plants by C. fructicola. This new information should assist farmers in selecting the best cultivation practices to manage strawberry anthracnose.
