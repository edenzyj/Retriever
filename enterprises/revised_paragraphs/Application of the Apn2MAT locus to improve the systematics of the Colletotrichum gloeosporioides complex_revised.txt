Abstract: To improve the phylogenetic resolution of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, we developed and tested the performance of a new set of primers for the Apn2/MAT locus with a case study of 22 isolates. These were isolated mainly from coffee plants and represent six divergent and well-characterized species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Following previous studies on this locus, we generated sequence data from an expanded region (over 4600 bp), revealing increased phylogenetic informativeness compared to other commonly used markers such as ITS, β-tub2, and GS. Within the Apn2/MAT locus, the ApMAT marker alone was almost as informative in terms of phylogenetic resolution as a seven-gene concatenated dataset. Our results further revealed that gene-tree discordance may be a common issue in resolving evolutionary relationships in the C. gloeosporioides complex, highlighting the importance of multilocus approaches. The use of advanced data analysis techniques and a highly informative dataset, as employed here, may help address this issue and assist in disentangling the C. gloeosporioides complex.

C. gloeosporioides is regarded as the most challenging species complex to resolve, comprising the broadest host range of all Colletotrichum species. Fungal strains from this complex have been reported from at least 1,800 plant hosts and present such a wide range of morphological and pathogenic variation that the species name is of limited practical use. A major contribution to the enlargement of this complex was the revision of the genus by von Arx, in which a wider spore range was established as a criterion for C. gloeosporioides identification. As a result, many Colletotrichum strains with similar cylindrical conidia were identified as C. gloeosporioides, lumping together potentially distinct taxa. Since the revision by Sutton until the most recent major revision of the genus, most studies on C. gloeosporioides systematics addressed only specific hosts, often reclassifying isolates previously described as C. gloeosporioides into other Colletotrichum species. In fact, the exceptionally broad host range of C. gloeosporioides hampers studies addressing the entire complex. The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides set an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Ever since, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference basis to which isolates can be compared. However, the criteria for species delimitation have been the subject of much debate throughout the years, and Colletotrichum has been an example. Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability. In particular, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA is the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides-specific primers have been widely used for the identification of Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are serious concerns about the resolving power of ITS for closely related species. The limitations of ITS and other similar markers are already recognized, making the development and use of more informative loci increasingly necessary. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective method to determine species boundaries—particularly by using genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition—and also to better understand species’ evolutionary relationships. The synergy of epitypification with the emergence of multilocus phylogenetic analyses provides an opportunity to unravel the species richness of the C. gloeosporioides complex. For instance, studies focused on Arabica coffee plants in Thailand and on cacao and other plant species in Panama were able to identify six new species from the C. gloeosporioides complex that represented phylogenetically distinct lineages from the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides.
Here we report the development and use of several primer sets for the Apn2/MAT locus to improve systematic resolution and knowledge of the C. gloeosporioides complex, focusing on species associated with Coffea spp. As shown by Crouch et al. (2009a), sequence data from this locus facilitated the successful resolution of the graminicolous Colletotrichum group. Rojas et al. (2010) also amplified and sequenced an orthologous region in a phylogenetic study of C. gloeosporioides s.l., further demonstrating its usefulness. In this study, we exploited this region for primer development and evaluated the effectiveness of the locus in comparison to other commonly used nuclear genes or regions, concentrating on a well-characterized group of species from coffee hosts. These included notably divergent and recognized species, such as the coffee berry disease (CBD) pathogen, C. kahawae, and other opportunistic pathogens identified by Prihastuti et al. (2009) that occur on various other hosts, as well as representatives of C. gloeosporioides s.s. We also employed a recent Bayesian data analysis technique for species tree reconstruction and compared it to the commonly used method of concatenation (Liu 2008).
Fungal material and DNA extraction: The Colletotrichum spp. isolates used in this study are provided in a detailed table. Nineteen isolates were obtained from the collection maintained at CIFC/IICT (Portugal) and three from the Mae Fah Luang University collection (Thailand), representing six previously characterized species from the C. gloeosporioides complex, namely C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. asianum, C. siamense, and C. fructicola, including ex-type specimens for the three latter species. C. kahawae isolates were identified based on BLAST queries of the ITS and b-tubulin 2 (b-tub2) sequences compared to the holotype and their ability to induce CBD symptoms on detached green coffee berries. This method has been shown to be the most reliable for identifying true C. kahawae isolates, as recent findings indicated the presence of non-C. kahawae isolates with identical genetic sequences for several nuclear markers, including ITS and b-tub2. The C. gloeosporioides sampling included isolates that closely resemble the ex-epitype strain at the ITS and b-tub2 loci. Similarly, BLAST queries of the MAT1-2-1 HMG locus identified five isolates as C. fragariae by compar

N o t se q u en ce d 398 MYCOLOGIA were obtained from Coffea spp. Isolates were revived on malt extract agar 1% with a bacterial inhibitor and grown for 5–7 days. They were then cultivated in liquid media containing 3% malt extract and 0.5% Peptone for 12–14 days at 25°C in the dark. DNA was extracted from freeze-dried mycelia using the DNeasy plant Minikit according to the manufacturer’s instructions.
A novel set of specific primers was developed to amplify a portion of the Apn2/MAT locus, using C. gloeosporioides as the main template. This genomic sequence spans 11,592 bp and includes the Apn2/MAT locus, which comprises two genes: Apn2 (2,244 bp) and MAT1-2-1 (842 bp), connected by an intergenic region of 713 bp and flanking regions. A representative sample of 10 isolates, comprising six species, was used to amplify and sequence the full portion of this locus. Primers were designed with PerlPrimer. The first two sets of specific primers were designed within and flanking the conserved HMG domain of MAT1-2-1.
The conditions for PCR amplification included 3 minutes at 94°C, followed by 30 cycles of 45 seconds at 94°C, 45 seconds at 62°C, and 1 minute at 72°C, with a final extension of 7 minutes at 72°C. The amplification products were sequenced and used as templates, along with the C. gloeosporioides accession, for further primer design. Based on these sequences, additional primer pairs were designed to amplify the remaining MAT1-2-1 gene and the 5' end of the Apn2 gene.
PCR conditions for the subsequent reactions were identical, with the exception of a 66°C annealing temperature for one primer pair. Amplification reactions were performed with 50 ng genomic DNA as template in a 15 µL PCR reaction mix containing dNTP mix, primers, DNA polymerase, and PCR buffer. The nomenclature of the molecular markers developed includes Apn23L, Apn2Ex3, Apn25L, ApMAT, MAT1-2-1, and MAT5L. Sequences were deposited at GenBank under the corresponding accession numbers.
Molecular data.—Using the complete taxa sampling of this study, five nuclear genes and two intergenic regions were sequenced. From the Apn2/MAT locus, the two intergenic regions (ApMAT and MAT5L), as well as the MAT1-2-1 gene and the Apn25L gene fragment, were selected based on their informative potential and sequence length. The ITS nuclear region and two gene fragments from b-tub2 and glutamine synthetase (GS) were also analyzed with previously described primers and PCR conditions. PCR products were verified by electrophoresis on a 1.2% w/v agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified. Sequencing reactions were conducted with BigDye chemistry on an ABI prism 310 automated sequencer. Amplicons were sequenced in both directions, and chromatograms were manually verified for errors using Sequencher.
Data analysis.—Datasets for each marker were aligned using Mafft with the L-INS-i method, followed by manual refinement in BioEdit. The nucleotide diversity (p) and its standard deviation were estimated for each selected marker in DNasp. To compare the polymorphisms between and among all markers in the representative sample, a sliding window analysis of nucleotide diversity was performed with a window length of 50 bp and a step of 25 bp. Sites with alignment gaps were not considered in the length of the windows, and all estimations were performed with standard parameters. Output graphics were produced using R with the ggplot2 library. For the phylogenetic analysis, we adjusted the ApMAT marker sequence boundaries to separate intergenic from coding regions, as these likely evolve according to different evolutionary models. Given that both ends of the ApMAT original sequence were composed of the 39 end of the Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes, these fragments were cut and merged with the original Apn25L and MAT1-2-1 sequences, respectively. The phylogenetic performance of each individual marker was first assessed using an online application that implements an empirical metric of phylogenetic informativeness, providing a quantitative prediction of the utility and information that individual partitions contain to resolve phylogenetic questions. The required ultrametric tree was provided using the UPGMA method in MEGA. Site rates for each partition were estimated with the HyPhy script. Phylogenetically informative values were calculated on a per-site basis to avoid biases from gene length and minimize phylogenetic noise. To create concatenated matrices from the individual datasets, the Concatenator sof
Apn-MAT and traditional datasets provided a more even comparison. Five C. fragariae isolates were used as outgroup taxa to root phylogenetic trees. Additional outgroup taxa could not be considered because orthologous regions for all our developed markers were unavailable in public databases, except for C. graminicola, whose sequences were too divergent for accurate and reliable alignments. Phylogenetic trees were constructed from the individual and combined analyses of the seven nuclear regions using maximum likelihood (ML) and a Bayesian framework with the Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm. Gaps were treated as missing data. The ML analysis was run in PAUP* 4.0d99, with heuristic searches of 100 replicates, random sequence addition, and a tree-bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping algorithm. Nonparametric bootstrapping was conducted with 1000 pseudoreplicates, involving 10 random additions and TBR branch swapping. ModelTest 3.7 was used to select the best-fit model of nucleotide evolution under the Akaike information criterion (AIC) for each dataset. The MCMC analysis was run in MrBayes 3.1.2 with the optimal model selected under the AIC, as implemented in MrModelTest 2.3, specified as prior for each partition. For the individual and combined datasets, Bayesian posterior probabilities were generated from 3 × 10^7 and 1 × 10^8 generations respectively, sampling every 1000th generation. The analysis was run three times with one cold and three incrementally heated Metropolis-coupled Monte Carlo Markov chains, starting from random trees. A total of 1 × 10^6 generations were discarded as burn-in. Trees were combined and summarized on a 50% majority rule consensus tree.
The total combined dataset was also analyzed with the species-tree approach implemented in BEST to incorporate the signals of each marker. BEST has been shown to address the common issue of deep coalescence in recently diverged species. It uses a hierarchical Bayesian approach to estimate the joint posterior distribution of multiple gene trees and is known to provide more accurate estimates than the concatenation method in some multilocus datasets. The BEST analysis was run in MrBayes 2.3, and model priors for each partition were estimated similarly to the MCMC analysis. Priors included an inverse gamma distribution for theta and a uniform distribution for gene mutation, estimated as part of the analysis. A total of 2.5 × 10^9 generations were sampled every 2000 generations. Convergence and mixing were assessed for all parameters with Tracer 1.4. The species tree was constructed from the combined runs.
Topology tests.—The current taxonomic relationship of the studied species was assessed through topology tests on each relevant dataset. Alternative hypotheses were tested against the most recent hypotheses of relationships between our species of interest with the topological test of Shimodaira and Hasegawa (SH) as implemented in PAUP* 4.0d99. Although this current taxonomy was not formally addressed, it provided an objective starting point for our analysis. First, we tested the unconstrained phylogenies of each dataset, which revealed discordant phylogenies to assess whether their branching order was significantly incongruent with the current taxonomy. Additionally, because C. siamense received only moderate support in the current taxonomy, we also tested the alternative hypothesis of its monophyly to the second closest taxon, C. asianum (i.e., {[C. siamense, C. asianum], C. fructicola}, instead of the current taxonomy {[C. siamense, C. fructicola}, C. asianum]) for congruent datasets. One thousand replicates were performed by resampling the partial likelihoods for each site (RELL model).
RESULTS Molecular marker analysis.—The newly developed set of primers allowed the amplification of 4,061 bp from the Apn2/MAT locus. Each primer pair produced partially overlapping fragments that, in combination, spanned all but the first 21 codons of Apn2, the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1, the complete MAT1-2-1 gene, and a small intergenic region adjacent to the 3' end of MAT1-2-1. As in previous Colletotrichum studies, only one mating type (MAT) locus idiomorph, MAT1-2-1, was identified. Clean bands were reproducibly amplified by PCR for all the isolates using all primer sets, generating amplicons of 740 bp for Apn23L, 760 bp for Apn2Ex3, 840 bp for Apn25L, 910 bp for ApMAT, and 1,040 bp for MAT1-2-1 and MAT5L. An overview of the Apn2/MAT locus map is included herein, along with the position and length of each developed marker, excluding overlapping segments. The ITS, b-tub2, and GS markers generated products of the expected size. The complete set of markers was first sequenced for a representative sample of 10 isolates comprising the five
MAT5L produced 4676 bp of sequence data for each studied isolate. According to the output of the PhyDesign application, the index of phylogenetic power per base pair of each dataset varied widely; however, all of our developed primers generated sequences with superior resolution power throughout the phylogeny. After visual inspection, the ApMAT sequence is predicted to be the most informative, followed by MAT5L, Apn25L, MAT1-2-1, GS, and b-tub2, whose differences in phylogenetic informativeness were less evident. The ITS sequence had the lowest predicted resolution power. All newly developed markers revealed more information than the traditional markers, as determined by parsimony and nucleotide diversity statistics as comparative benchmarks. ApMAT, Apn25L, MAT5L, and MAT1-2-1 were 35%, 19%, 20%, and 17% parsimony informative, compared to 3%, 13%, and 16% for ITS, b-tub2, and GS, respectively. Regarding the combined datasets, even when excluding MAT1-2-1 to balance the sequence length of the two partially concatenated datasets, the Apn-MAT dataset exhibited 478 parsimony informative characters from a total of 1886 (25%), while the traditional markers contributed only 232 parsimony informative characters from a total of 1965 (12%). Altogether, the total concatenated dataset presented 801 (17%) parsimony informative nucleotide characters with parsimony criteria.
In our phylogenetic analysis, we first constructed phylogenies from each of the individual markers. The maximum likelihood (ML) and Bayesian Markov Chain Monte Carlo (BMCMC) analyses consistently resulted in identical topologies for each dataset, although not all gene trees had the same resolution. For example, ITS and MAT5L provided poorly resolved trees that did not yield discernible topologies and were not analyzed individually. In contrast, ApMAT exhibited the best resolving ability, allowing all species/groups, and even some intragroup nodes, to be distinguished with high support in both analyses. Most C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates clustered with the ex-type strains of C. siamense and C. fructicola. Generally, species/groups were reciprocally monophyletic, although with varying degrees of support. An exception was the GS gene tree, where two isolates from the C. siamense group were part of a monophyletic group with C. fructicola. However, further incongruities arose when comparing the relative taxonomic positions of the ingroup species. Excluding C. kahawae, consistently revealed as the most basal lineage, all other species exhibited different taxonomic relationships in each of the independent loci analyzed, leading to significant gene-tree discordance. For instance, C. siamense was found to be part of the same monophyletic group with either C. asianum or C. fructicola, depending on the dataset analyzed. In the GS gene tree, although there was little support for the reciprocal monophyly of C. siamense isolates, the best ML and BMCMC trees suggested a closer relationship with C. fructicola rather than with C. asianum. The second most basal lineage identified also exhibited discordance, being classified as either C. gloeosporioides or C. asianum. Th
Apn-MAT datasets provided almost completely resolved and highly supported trees, presenting two different topologies in which C. siamense was either reciprocally monophyletic with C. asianum or C. fructicola. When all markers were combined, the prevailing phylogenetic relationships were congruent with the Apn-MAT dataset, supporting the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense and C. fructicola. Interestingly, both the topology and node support of the single ApMAT marker were similar to the seven-gene concatenated dataset.
The current taxonomic and evolutionary relationships of the included species from the C. gloeosporioides complex were further assessed using two statistical methods. First, the species-tree approach of the BEST software was employed, accounting for discrepancies between gene trees and using coalescent theory to combine those gene trees into a species tree. The obtained tree shared the same topology as the Apn-MAT and total concatenated datasets, albeit with smaller support for the reciprocal monophyly between C. siamense and C. asianum. Nonetheless, the remaining relationships were highly supported. For the topological tests, we assumed the null hypothesis of the most recently reported species relationship, which is identical to that exhibited by the traditional dataset. Except for b-tub2, all individual datasets were discordant, with only the branching order of ApMAT and MAT1-2-1 deviating significantly from the current taxonomic understanding. The combined Apn-MAT topology also showed significant differences, while the deviation of the total combined dataset was only marginally significant.
Resolving species complexes in Colletotrichum, particularly the C. gloeosporioides complex, is a demanding quest in which molecular systematic tools are becoming essential for taxonomists. However, genomic regions are not equally informative, making it crucial to select the most useful loci to address this issue. The MAT locus has been employed successfully in phylogenetic studies of Colletotrichum.
2006, 2009; Rojas et al. 2010) as well as in other genera, such as Cochliobolus (Turgeon 1998), Fusarium (O’Donnell et al. 2004), and Leptosphaeria (Voigt et al. 2005). In our work, a newly developed set of primers enabled the analysis of an expanded region of the Apn2/MAT locus in relation to other studies exploring this locus (Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al. 2009, Rojas et al. 2010). In fact, our primer sets were able to generate not only orthologous sequences to those already published (e.g., the 3' end of the Apn2 gene and the intergenic region between MAT1-2-1 [Crouch et al. 2009, Rojas et al. 2010] or the intron in the HMG region of the MAT1-2-1 gene [Du et al. 2005]) but also the remainder of the Apn2 gene sequence, as well as the complete MAT1-2-1 gene along with a portion of the 5' intergenic region, covering approximately 2,700 bp of novel sequence data from this locus. Overall, our analyses further demonstrated the potential of this genomic region to provide an outstanding improvement in phylogenetic informativeness to address the taxonomic challenges of the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Even though our analyses focused mostly on Coffea spp.-inhabiting species of the C. gloeosporioides complex, this sampling strategy proved valuable under the current taxonomic knowledge. First, the six species used in our study encompass relatively divergent lineages within the complex (4.5–10.1% sequence divergence). Therefore, despite probably not covering all of the putatively high species richness of the complex, they provide a wide range of sequence diversity, which is useful to assess the robustness of the developed primers and enhances their potential applicability to other species in the C. gloeosporioides complex. Second, unlike the myriad undescribed and poorly known lineages in this complex, the species used here are well characterized and recognized by multilocus phylogenetic and morphological studies, which is paramount when investigating the value of the newly developed molecular tools for systematic purposes. Third, all these species were already used simultaneously in previous and independent phylogenetic studies, providing an objective starting point for their taxonomic relationships and allowing a much more meaningful comparison of traditional gene-tree concatenation and recent species-tree reconstruction methods.
Regarding their informative potential, all newly developed primer pairs generated sequences that were superior to ITS and the two commonly used gene fragments, b-tub2 and GS, even though the latter had been useful and
The ITS sequence, considered one of the most promising regions for fungal barcoding, performed poorly in our benchmark comparisons, being unable to distinguish taxonomic groups and recover their relationships. This finding has been corroborated by other studies. The sliding window analysis of polymorphism and parsimony statistics revealed that the intergenic region between the Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 genes is the most variable segment, making it a promising marker for both taxonomic and population genetic studies in the complex. Intergenic regions are generally expected to be much more variable because they are not under functional constraints or direct selective pressures; however, this variability also makes them unsuitable for primer design across a broad range of species. The ApMAT intergenic segment is flanked by fairly conserved regions, allowing for the design of primers, which makes it an ideal marker for the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Additionally, both the introns from the MAT1-2-1 gene and the two extremities of the Apn2 gene exhibited variability and should also be useful for systematic purposes, as reported in other Colletotrichum studies. Nonetheless, these markers are not suitable as barcode candidates, and attempts to use them outside the C. gloeosporioides complex may fail due to their highly variable nature, even in priming sites. For example, markers developed to amplify partial fragments of the Apn2 gene and intergenic region for the gramini-colous Colletotrichum species could not be used in the isolates analyzed in this study. After obtaining homologous sequences from isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex, alignments revealed a high divergence between the two groups of species. However, these markers are more suitable than barcode genes for accurately dissecting and understanding the diversity and evolutionary relationships within a complex of closely related species.
Moreover, as stated in other studies, the selection of the most suitable barcode gene(s) can only occur during species delimitation, as this is when we know which taxa need to be distinguished. To adequately search for and select a barcode gene, it is crucial first to fully resolve the C. gloeosporioides complex using a set of highly informative genes. Our study confirmed the ubiquitous presence of only one MAT gene idiomorph, MAT1-2-1. In the fungal kingdom, MAT idiomorphs code for transcription factors that regulate sexual development and recognition. However, the configuration in Colletotrichum species appears to differ from that of the majority of ascomycetes, where a single MAT locus exists as two alternate idiomorphs. The exclusive presence of a MAT1-2 homolog in all species included in this work supports the idea that the genetic control underlying sexual reproduction in this genus does not conform to any known system in the entire fungal kingdom. In our phylogenetic analyses of the indiv
Alone, it provided essentially the same information and support as the concatenated tree of seven genes, a feat that was not achieved by any other single marker. The other markers had variable degrees of resolution and support, ranging from low to moderate, which is typically expected for nuclear gene markers when addressing recently diverged taxa. However, gene trees are only single realizations of the true species tree, and they may not reflect the actual pattern of lineage splitting and divergence due to coalescent stochasticity. Therefore, it is useful to reconstruct individual gene trees to provide an overview of how each marker depicts species relationships. By comparing the topology of each gene tree, several incongruities were revealed. For example, two isolates that were consistently shown to cluster with the C. siamense group (Mal5 and CCM5) were monophyletic with isolates from the C. fructicola group in the GS gene tree. Moreover, each analyzed locus provided strong support for a discordant species branching order, and the correct relationship of the studied Colletotrichum species was not clear. In fact, only one gene tree (b-tub2) was congruent with the current taxonomic understanding of the sampled species, whereas the ApMAT and MAT1-2-1 gene trees revealed a significantly deviated phylogenetic signal. Even when different combinations of genes are concatenated, these discordances remain significant, as evidenced by the ambiguous relationship of C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. asianum between the traditional and ApMAT datasets. Several causes for discordance between gene trees in phylogenetic studies exist, including horizontal gene transfer, hybridization, or incomplete lineage sorting. To our knowledge, this is the first report of gene-tree discordance among species of the C. gloeosporioides complex. In this study, although the total concatenated dataset provided a single resolved topology congruent with that of the combined ApMAT and individual ApMAT datasets, the concatenation method's assumption of no heterogeneity between the embedded gene trees was violated. Additionally, the longer and more informative markers, such as those from the ApMAT locus, may bias tree topology toward themselves because their phylogenetic signal can overwhelm the information contained in less informative markers. Because the evolutionary history of species is widely considered to be mostly a stochastic process, we have applied a recent statistical framework that accounts for the discrepancies of gene trees from multiple unlinked loci and is specifically conceived to estimate the species tree. Using a Bayesian hierarchical model, the analysis aims to clarify these complex relationships.
BEST program is capable of accommodating gene tree heterogeneity while retrieving useful information from it, providing a more accurate estimate of the true species tree (Edwards et al. 2007). The resultant species-tree topology supported that of the total concatenated dataset, except for the relationships between C. siamense and C. asianum. Although all other nodes were highly supported, there was little support for the reciprocal monophyly between these two species, and the relationship involving C. fructicola remained unresolved. This result was achieved despite the use of large and highly informative sequence data in our analysis. Nonetheless, it is expected that the problems arising from incomplete lineage sorting increase as the time since species divergence decreases (Degnan and Rosenberg 2009). Therefore, it seems likely that these species diverged recently, and their relationships may still not be easily resolved. Nonetheless, to better understand the processes that promote speciation and the evolution of phenotypic traits, it is essential to recognize and delimit nascent evolutionary lineages (Wiens 2007). Additionally, it will be interesting to assess the effects of using different outgroup taxa in phylogenetic inference as our current taxonomic knowledge of Colletotrichum expands and molecular tools improve. Overall, this study demonstrates the considerable improvement that the Apn2/MAT locus may provide to the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex. We report the development and application of a novel set of primers as valuable tools to generate sequence data that can clarify species and even population relationships. Based on our data, an alternative view of the evolutionary relationships of the studied species is hypothesized. We also showed that gene tree discordance may be a problem in recently diverged species of this complex, stressing that highly variable markers, such as the ApMAT, are more likely to overcome these issues and successfully elucidate phylogenetic relationships. It is hoped that this contribution will assist and stimulate further research on this challenging complex, ultimately leading to a more comprehensive understanding of its structure, evolution, and diversity.

RAPD and ribosomal DNA markers are important tools in plant pathology. Nguyen et al. (2009) identified various Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose disease in coffee plants in Vietnam. Nylander (2004) developed MrModeltest v2, which is distributed by the Evolutionary Biology Centre at Uppsala University in Sweden. O’Donnell and Cigelnik (1997) found two divergent intragenomic rDNA ITS2 types within a monophyletic lineage of the fungus Fusarium, which are nonorthologous. Further research by O’Donnell et al. (2004) supported the formal recognition of nine phylogenetically distinct species within the Fusarium graminearum clade, based on genealogical concordance between the mating type locus and seven other nuclear genes.
Phoulivong et al. (2010) argued that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is not a common pathogen of tropical fruits. Pina-Martins and Paulo (2008) introduced Concatenator, a program that simplifies the handling of sequence data matrices. Polashock et al. (2009) provided a systematic overview of the North American cranberry fruit rot fungal community using both morphological and phylogenetic methods. Posada and Crandall (1998) developed Modeltest, a tool for testing DNA substitution models.
Prihastuti et al. (2009) characterized Colletotrichum species associated with coffee berries in northern Thailand, while Ramos et al. (2006) conducted a molecular and morphological characterization of Colletotrichum species involved in citrus anthracnose in Portugal. Rodríguez-Guerra et al. (2005) observed heterothallic mating among Mexican isolates of Glomerella lindemuthiana. Rojas et al. (2010) explored Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. associated with Theobroma cacao and other plants in Panama, distinguishing host-associated pathogens from asymptomatic endophytes through multilocus phylogenetic analyses.
