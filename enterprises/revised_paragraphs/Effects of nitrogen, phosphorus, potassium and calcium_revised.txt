Effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium nutrition on strawberry anthracnose
The effects of various concentrations of four nutrients—nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium—in fertilizer solutions on the severity of anthracnose in strawberry cv. Nyoho cultivated under a non-circulation hydroponics system were determined after inoculation with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Crop growth and the tissue contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in the entire above-ground parts of the plant were also investigated. Elevated nitrogen and potassium concentrations in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity, while phosphorus and calcium did not show this effect. Treatment with either ammonium or nitrate nitrogen did not result in significant differences. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (R² = 0.9078) and phosphorus (R² = 0.8842), but was not influenced by increased amounts of potassium (R² = 0.8587) and calcium (R² = 0.6526).

Introduction
In Korea, strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) are favored for winter cultivation when the production of other vegetables and fruits is relatively low. In 2003, strawberries were planted on a total area of 7,503 hectares in Korea, with plastic greenhouse cultivation comprising 7,172 hectares and fresh market production totaling 205,427 tonnes. The use of forcing, where strawberries are transplanted into greenhouses in mid-September and forced into fruiting in December, is increasing in Korea. June-bearing cultivars such as Mae Hyang, Akihime, and Nyoho used for forcing have proven difficult to grow due to their susceptibility to anthracnose. Anthracnose is one of the most damaging diseases of strawberries, causing wilting and death of transplants in the nursery field. The pathogen responsible for the disease in Korea is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, first reported in 1992. The nutritional status of a plant has a major impact on susceptibility to disease, which has been exploited for the reduction of disease severity. In particular, nitrogen and the form of nitrogen used can be influential. For example, black root rot complex (Rhizoctonia fragariae / Pratylenchus penetrans) of strawberries was suppressed by the application of (NH₄)₂SO₄, and C. phomoides was controlled using NH₄-N fertilizer. However, the severity of fusarium disease in tomatoes and anthracnose in cotton was elevated with NH₄-N. Similarly, rice blast disease is exacerbated in the presence of excess nitrogen. In contrast, when calcium was applied, tomatoes showed increased resistance to fusarium wilt.
Little is currently known about the influence of plant nutrition on anthracnose of strawberry. The purpose of this study was to investigate the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium concentrations on the development of strawberry anthracnose, with the aim of developing practical strategies to manage the disease.
Materials and Methods
Plant Preparation
Tissue-cultured seedlings of strawberry cv. Nyoho at the three-leaf stage were transplanted into 15 cm (1.6 L) plastic pots containing perlite. Transplants were irrigated for a month with distilled water to leach out nutrients contained in the perlite, which also lowered the tissue nutrient content of the strawberry plants. Following this, plants were watered with the nutrient treatment solution every 2 days for 50 days.
Nutrient Solutions
The Hoagland nutrient solution was modified to create treatment solutions containing 0, 5, 10, 15, 20, and 30 mM nitrogen; 0, 0.25, 0.5, 0.75, 1, and 3 mM phosphorus; 0, 10, 20, and 30 mM potassium; or 0, 1.5, 3, 4.5, and 6.0 mM calcium. The pH of all treatment solutions was adjusted to 6.5 using 1 N HCl or KOH. The effect of the form of nitrogen was tested by comparing 5, 10, and 15 mM nitrate and ammonium compounds.
Cultural Practice
The experimental design was a completely randomized plot with five replications. Pots were placed 25 cm apart in rows. The experiment was conducted in a glasshouse with a temperature range of 17–18 °C at night and 24–28 °C during the day. The relative humidity ranged from 40 to 80%, and daylight intensity from 550 to 1200 µmol m−2 s−1 during the experimental period.
Plant Analysis
Plant tissue was sampled from shoots after 1 month of nutrient solution treatments. Tissue samples were washed with 0.2 N HCl for 1 min, rinsed with distilled water, dried for 2 days at 70 °C, and ground in a Wiley mill to pass through a 1 mm particle size sieve. Total nitrogen was determined by a modified Kjeldahl procedure, which included a salicylic acid pretreatment to aid in the reduction of nitrate. Tissue used for phosphorus, potassium, and calcium analysis was dry-ashed at 500 °C, dehydrated in HCl, and finally dissolved in 0.5 N HCl. Analysis of potassium and calcium was done by atomic absorption spectrometry, and colorimetric analysis was performed for phosphorus.
Inoculation and Disease Assessment
Growth characteristics were determined for plants after 1 month of nutrient solution treatments. Inoculum of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (CGF43) was prepared at 10^6 conidia mL−1 and sprayed on the plants. The inoculated plants were incubated in a dew chamber at 30 °C and 100% relative humidity for 2 days and then moved to a glasshouse held between 24 and 28 °C. After 17 days, the disease severity on each plant was rated. Disease sev
Dry weight of strawberry plants was greatest when provided with 30 mM nitrogen, 1 mM phosphorus, 10 mM potassium, and 3 mM calcium. Anthracnose symptoms first appeared in the nitrogen treatment approximately 2 weeks after inoculation. A positive correlation (adjusted R² = 0.96) was found between nitrogen concentration of treatment solution and anthracnose disease. Disease was greatest (DI ∼ 3) at a nitrogen concentration of 30 mM. Anthracnose tended to be more severe in treatments receiving NH4 than NO3, but these differences were not significant according to Duncan’s multiple range test (P = 0.05). A similar positive relationship (adjusted R² = 0.84) between disease and potassium concentration of treatment solution was shown, with a maximum DI of ∼ 3 at 30 mM potassium.
The nutrient solutions applied to strawberry plants varied in their composition across different treatments. The nitrogen levels ranged from 0 to 30 mM, with corresponding phosphorus, potassium, calcium, magnesium, and sulfate values adjusted accordingly. The treatments were designed to assess the impact of varying nutrient concentrations on the growth and health of strawberry plants. All pots received micronutrients, including manganese, boron, zinc, copper, molybdenum, and iron, to ensure comprehensive nutrient availability.
In contrast, neither increasing concentrations of calcium (P = 0.62) nor those of phosphorus (P = 0.68) had a patterned effect on disease. For all treatments, the relative dry matter content of each nutrient in the test plants increased with increasing concentration in the treatment solution. Previous studies have shown correlations between nitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose, as in the case of cotton. Previous research indicated that as tissue nitrogen content decreased, calcium and manganese contents, which play a direct role in phenolic metabolism, increased in strawberry. Manganese may enhance the synthesis of host defense products, thereby reducing disease incidence and/or severity, while calcium has been shown to inhibit anthracnose in apples and decrease postharvest disease development on strawberries. However, in this study, no effect was found of calcium content on anthracnose disease in strawberry. As manganese content increases under low nitrogen conditions in plants, additional work is needed to determine whether manganese levels are related to anthracnose development. Phosphorus supplied as phosphite was effective at reducing phytophthora root and crown rot in tomato and pepper plants but also suppressed plant growth.

Figure 1: Development of anthracnose (scatter plot with error bars) and nutrient concentration (vertical bars) in strawberry plants treated with different concentrations of nitrogen (a), phosphorus (b), potassium (c), and calcium (d). Disease index: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% petioles affected; 2, ≥ 50% petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on entire plants. Adjusted regression coefficients and line derivations in (a) and (c) were significant (P ≤ 0.05). Differences in (b) and (d) were nonsignificant (P ≥ 0.62). Error bars represent ± standard error of the mean.
Phosphorus concentration had no influence on anthracnose development. Strawberry prefers NH₄⁺ to NO₃⁻ nitrogen for optimal growth (Park, 1990). Other studies have shown that using NH₄⁺ increases cotton anthracnose (Bollenbacher & Fulton, 1971) and fusarium crown rot severity (Woltz et al., 1992) more than using nitrate. It was found on average that strawberry plants receiving ammonium nitrogen had more disease than those receiving nitrate treatments, but these differences were not significant. It has been shown that increasing nitrogen and potassium in nutrient solutions resulted in higher dry matter percentages of both elements in strawberry but also increased the severity of anthracnose. To decrease anthracnose in strawberries, it is suggested that a minimum of nitrogen and potassium should be present in any fertilizer used and that this should not exceed 15 and 10 units of nitrogen and potassium, respectively.
