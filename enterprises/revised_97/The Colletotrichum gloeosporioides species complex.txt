Abstract: The limits of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex are defined genetically, based on a strongly supported clade within the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree. All taxa accepted within this clade are morphologically typical of the broadly defined C. gloeosporioides, as applied in the literature for the past 50 years. We accept 22 species plus one subspecies within the C. gloeosporioides complex, including C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. psidii, C. siamense, C. theobromicola, C. tropicale, and C. xanthorrhoeae, along with new taxa described here: C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alatae, C. alienum, C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, C. salsolae, and C. ti, plus the nomen novum C. queenslandicum (for C. gloeosporioides var. minus). All taxa are defined genetically based on multi-gene phylogenies. Brief morphological descriptions are provided for species lacking modern descriptions. Many species cannot be reliably distinguished using ITS, the official barcoding gene for fungi. Particularly problematic are a set of species closely related to C. musae and another set closely related to C. kahawae, referred to here as the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade, respectively. Each clade contains several species that are phylogenetically well-supported in multi-gene analyses, but branch lengths within the clades are short due to a limited number of phylogenetically informative characters. In some cases, individual gene trees are incongruent. Certain single genes or combinations of genes, such as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and glutamine synthetase, can reliably distinguish most taxa and should be developed as secondary barcodes for species-level identification, which is crucial as many of these fungi have biosecurity significance. Additionally, notes are provided for names suggested in recent literature as possibly closely related to C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and its putative teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata.

INTRODUCTION: The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was first formally proposed in studies by von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970), which taxonomically formalized this concept.
Genetic and biological diversity associated with various species names has been a significant focus in early studies. These papers often discussed morphological similarities among fungi from different hosts; however, the breadth of these similarities became of little practical use to plant pathologists. They provided minimal information regarding pathogenicity, host range, or other attributes of the Colletotrichum species described. The studies by von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957) did not rely on direct examination of type material for all species, leading to questions about whether the species in question were indeed distinct. Some research attempted to explore the connections between various Colletotrichum species and their sexual Glomerella state (e.g., Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia 1925).
Notably, authors such as Shear & Wood (1907, 1913) and Small (1926) concluded that many species described based on host preference were, in fact, identical, rejecting apparent differences in host preference as a basis for taxonomic segregation. For instance, Small (1926) asserted that the names Glomerella cingulata and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides should be used for the sexual and asexual morphs, respectively, of various Colletotrichum species they considered conspecific.
Recent molecular studies have enhanced our understanding of phylogenetic relationships among grass-inhabiting species within the C. graminicola group, leading to the development of a more practical taxonomy for this group of fungi (e.g., Hsiang & Goodwin 2001, Du et al. 2005, Crouch et al. 2006). This group is now recognized as comprising several host-specialized, genetically well-characterized species, although a modern taxonomy for C. gloeosporioides remains unresolved.

Sutton (1992) commented on C. gloeosporioides, stating that “No progress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging to this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone.” Progress towards a modern understanding of this species began with the designation of an epitype specimen, derived from a culture, to stabilize the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs to a strongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have historically been confused with C. gloeosporioides, such as C. acutatum and C. boninense (e.g., Abang et al. 2002; Martinez-Culebras et al. 2003; Johnston et al. 2005; Chung et al. 2006; Farr et al. 2006; Than et al. 2008). However, the biological and genetic relationships within the broad C. gloeosporioides clade remain unclear, and ITS sequences alone are insufficient to resolve them.
In this study, we define the limits of the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on ITS sequences. The species we accept within this complex form a strongly supported clade in the ITS gene tree (see Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All taxa included in the C. gloeosporioides complex align with the traditional morphological concept of the group (e.g., von Arx 1970; Mordue 1971; Sutton 1980). Commonly used species names within the C. gloeosporioides complex include C. fragariae, C. musae, and C. kahawae. Since the epitype paper (Cannon et al. 2008), several new C. gloeosporioides-like species have been described in regional studies, where multi-gene analyses have shown these new species to be phylogenetically distinct from the ex-epitype strain of C. gloeosporioides (e.g., Rojas et al. 2010; Phoulivong et al. 2011; Wikee et al. 2011).
The regional nature of most studies, along with often restricted genetic sampling across the global diversity of C. gloeosporioides, and minimal overlap between isolates treated and gene regions targeted, means that the relationships among newly described species are frequently poorly understood. While some authors have adopted a genetically restricted concept for C. gloeosporioides, many applied researchers continue to use the name broadly (e.g., Bogo et al. 2012; Deng et al. 2012; Kenny et al. 2012; Parvin et al. 2012; Zhang et al. 2012). In this paper, we accept both concepts as useful and valid. When used in a broad sense, we refer to the taxon as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat.
This paper aims to clarify the genetic and taxonomic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides species complex using a diverse set of isolates that samples its genetic, biological, and geographic diversity. Type specimens or cultures derived from type specimens have been examined whenever possible. Although we do not treat all names placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970), we do include all names that have been suggested to have a close relationship with C. gloeosporioides in recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata.
ITS sequences, the official barcoding gene for fungi (Seifert 2009; Schoch et al. 2012), do not reliably resolve relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. We define species in the complex genetically rather than morphologically, based on phylogenetic analyses of up to eight genes. Following Cannon et al. (2012, this issue), we use the generic name Colletotrichum as the preferred name for all species throughout this paper, regardless of whether a Glomerella state has been observed or named for that fungus.
An attempt was made to sample the genetic diversity of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides as broadly as possible. Isolates from diverse hosts around the world were selected for more intensive study. A BLAST search of GenBank using the ITS sequence of the epitype culture of C. gloeosporioides (Cannon et al. 2008) provided a coarse estimate for the genetic limits of the C. gloeosporioides complex. The ITS diversity across the complex was utilized to select a genetically diverse set of isolates. Voucher cultures were obtained from the research groups that deposited the GenBank records. In addition to these, isolates representing the known genetic and morphological diversity of C. gloeosporioides from New Zealand were included. These isolates were collected from rots of both native and introduced fruits, from diseased exotic weeds, and as endophytes from the leaves of native podocarps. Additional isolates, representing ex-type and authentic cultures of as many named taxa and formae speciales within the C. gloeosporioides complex as possible, were sourced from international culture collections. Approximately 400 isolates belonging to the C. gloeosporioides complex were obtained. GAPDH gene sequences were generated for all isolates as an initial measure of genetic diversity. A subset of 156 isolates, selected to represent a range of genetic, geographic, and host plant diversity, was used in this research (see Table 1).
Most of the New Zealand isolates had been stored as conidial suspensions made from single conidium or ascospore cultures and then kept at -80 °C in a 5% glycerol/water suspension. Additional isolates from New Zealand were acquired from the ICMP culture collection, where they are stored as lyophilized (freeze-dried) ampoules or in a metabolically inactive state in liquid nitrogen at -196 °C. The storage history of most isolates received from other research groups is not known. Table 1 provides a list of the isolates studied. All contributors of cultures are acknowledged at the end of this manuscript, and additional details on each culture are available on the ICMP website (http://www.landcareresearch.co.nz/resources/collections/icmp).

Gene sequences were obtained from eight nuclear gene regions: actin (ACT) [316 bp], calmodulin (CAL) [756 bp], chitin synthase (CHS-1) [229 bp], glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) [308 bp], the ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS) [615 bp], glutamine synthetase (GS) [907 bp], manganese-superoxide dismutase (SOD2) [376 bp], and β-tubulin 2 (TUB2) [716 bp].
PCR primers used during this study are summarized in Table 2. The standard CAL primers (O’Donnell et al. 2000) yielded poor or non-specific amplification for most isolates; thus, new primers (CL1C, CL2C) were designed for Colletotrichum based on the C. graminicola M1.001 genome sequence. The standard GS primers (Stephenson et al. 1997) sequenced poorly for some isolates due to an approximately 9 bp homopolymer T run located 71 bp from the end of the GSF1 primer binding site. A new primer, GSF3, was designed 41 bp downstream of this region to eliminate the homopolymer slippage error in sequencing. The reverse primer GSR2 was designed in the same location as GSR1 with one nucleotide change. Both new GS primers were based on similarities with a C. theobromicola UQ62 sequence (GenBank L78067, also referred to as C. gloeosporioides).
The PCRs were performed using an Applied Biosystems Veriti Thermal Cycler in a total volume of 25 μL. The PCR mixtures contained 15.8 μL of UV-sterilized ultra-filtered water, 2.5 μL of 10× PCR buffer (with 20 mM MgCl2), 2.5 μL of dNTPs (each 20 μM), 1 μL of each primer (10 μM), 1 μL of BSA, 1 μL of genomic DNA, and 0.2 μL (1 U) of Roche FastStart Taq DNA Polymerase.
The PCR conditions for ITS were as follows: 4 minutes at 95 °C, followed by 35 cycles of 95 °C for 30 seconds, 52 °C for 30 seconds, and 72 °C for 45 seconds, concluding with 7 minutes at 72 °C. The annealing temperatures differed for the other genes, with optimal temperatures for each as follows: ACT: 58 °C, CAL: 59 °C, CHS-1: 58 °C, GAPDH: 60 °C, GS: 54 °C, SOD2: 54 °C, TUB2: 55 °C. Some isolates required adjusted temperatures and occasionally yielded multiple bands, which were excised separately from an electrophoresis gel and purified. PCR products were purified on a Qiagen MinElute 96 UF PCR Purification Plate.
DNA sequences were obtained in both directions on an Applied Biosystems 3130xl Avant Genetic Analyzer using BigDye v. 3.1 chemistry. Electropherograms were analyzed and assembled using Sequencher v. 4.10.1 (Gene Codes Corp.).
Multiple sequence alignments of each gene were performed using ClustalX v. 2.1 (Larkin et al. 2007) and were manually adjusted where necessary with Geneious Pro v. 5.5.6 (Drummond et al. 2011).
Bayesian inference (BI) was employed to reconstruct most of the phylogenies using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist et al. 2012). Bayesian inference has significant advantages over other analysis methods, such as maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony (Archibald et al. 2003), as it provides measures of clade support in the form of posterior probabilities instead of random resampling bootstraps. jModelTest v. 0.1.1 (Posada 2008) was utilized to conduct statistical selection of the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution using the corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) (see Table 3). Initial analyses indicated that individual genes were broadly congruent, thus nucleotide alignments of all genes were concatenated using Geneious, and separate partitions were created for each gene with its own model of nucleotide substitution. Analyses of the full dataset were run twice for 5 x 10^7 generations and twice for 2 x 10^7 generations for the clade trees. Samples were taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. Convergence of all parameters was checked using internal diagnostics of the standard deviation of split frequencies and performance scale reduction factors (PSRF), as well as externally with Tracer v. 1.5 (Rambaut & Drummond 2007). Based on these diagnostics, the first 25% of generations were discarded as burn-in.
Several species-tree analyses were conducted using BEAST v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012). Species trees combine multi-gene and multiple isolate data to reconstruct the evolutionary history of hypothesized species, rather than individual isolates. BEAST does not use concatenation but rather co-estimates the individual gene trees embedded within the summary species tree. It also estimates the time since each species shared a common ancestor (divergence times). For these analyses, the species tree ancestral reconstruction option was selected (Heled & Drummond 2010), the gene data were partitioned as for Bayesian Inference (BI), and the substitution model for each gene was selected based on the models chosen using jModelTest. The individual isolates were grouped into sets of species by setting species names as trait values. A strict clock was used for the GAPDH gene (as an all intronic sequence, it was assumed to accumulate mutations at a steady rate), while the clock rates for other genes were estimated relative to GAPDH, using an uncorrelated lognormal relaxed clock. The species tree prior used for all genes was the Yule process, with the ploidy type set to nuclear autosomal. Uninformative priors were used for all parameters and were allowed to auto-optimize.
The first species-tree analysis was conducted using the dataset of 158 isolates and five genes, with C. boninense and C. hippeastri as outgroups. The MCMC chain was set to 1 × 10^8 generations for the species complex tree, with samples taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. The analysis was run independently twice. The effective sample size (ESS), traces of all parameters, and convergence of the two runs were checked with Tracer. A summary maximum clade credibility species tree was built with TreeAnnotator v. 1.7.1 (Drummond et al. 2012), using a 10% burn-in and a posterior probability limit of 0.5, setting the heights of each node in the tree to the mean height across the entire sample of trees for that clade. Separate analyses were conducted using all eight genes and the same restricted set of isolates chosen to represent taxa within the Musae and Kahawae clades, as were used for the BI analyses of the eight-gene concatenated analyses outlined above. For each of the Musae and Kahawae clade analyses, the MCMC chain was set to 5 × 10^7 generations, but otherwise run as for the five-gene dataset.
To illustrate the potential limitations of ITS in discriminating species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, a UPGMA tree was built of all 158 ITS sequences using the Geneious tree builder tool. A UPGMA tree visually approximates a BLAST search, which is based on distances (and sequence length) rather than corrected nucleotide substitutions typical of more sophisticated, model-based analyses.
Sequences derived in this study were lodged in GenBank (Table 1), the concatenated alignment and trees in TreeBASE (www.treebase.org) study number S12535, and taxonomic novelties in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004).
Detailed morphological descriptions are provided only for those species lacking a recently published description. Few specimens were examined from infected host material; the descriptions provided are mostly based on agar cultures. Cultures were grown on Difco PDA from single conidia, or from single hyphal tips for the few specimens where no conidia were formed, with culture diameter measured and appearance described after 10 days of growth at 18–20°C under mixed white and UV fluorescent tubes (12 hours light/12 hours dark). Colour codes follow Kornerup & Wanscher (1963).
Table 2 provides a list of the primers used in this study, detailing their sequences and sources.
Table 3: Nucleotide substitution models used in phylogenetic analyses.
Conidia were measured and described from the conidial ooze on acervuli, mounted in lactic acid. At least 24 conidia were measured for each isolate, with measurements reported as ranges in the format (lower extreme –) 25% quartile – 75% quartile (–upper extreme), all rounded to the nearest 0.5 µm. Cultures were periodically examined for perithecia development. Ascospores were measured and described from perithecia crushed in lactic acid.
Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique. A small square of agar was inoculated on one side with conidia and immediately covered with a sterile cover slip. After 14 days, the cover slip was removed and placed in a drop of lactic acid on a glass slide.
All morphological measurements were analyzed using the statistical program “R” v. 2.14.0 (R Development Core Team 2011). The R package ggplot2 (Wickham 2009) was used for graphical plots. The box plots displayed the median, upper and lower quartiles, with 'whiskers' extending to the outlying data or to a maximum of 1.5 times the interquartile range; individual outliers outside this range were shown as dots.

DNA sequences of five genes were obtained from all 158 isolates included in the study and concatenated to form a supermatrix of 2294 base pairs (bp). The gene boundaries in the alignment were as follows: ACT: 1–316, CAL: 317–1072, CHS-1: 1073–1371, GAPDH: 1372–1679, ITS: 1680–2294. A Bayesian Inference (BI) analysis of the concatenated dataset is presented in Figure 1. This tree is annotated with the species boundaries of the taxa accepted within the C. gloeosporioides complex. The clades representing these taxa form the basis for investigating the morphological and biological diversity of our species. Ex-type and authentic isolates are highlighted in bold and labeled with the names under which they were originally described. The posterior probability (PP) support for the grouping of most species ranges from 1 to 0.96; however, support for deeper nodes is often lower, for example, 0.53 for the root of C. ti and C. aotearoa, indicating that the branching may be uncertain for these species. Branch lengths and node PP are typically lower within a species than between species.
The large number of taxa in Figure 1 makes it challenging to visualize the interspecific genetic distances between the recognized species. The unrooted tree in Figure 2 represents the results of a BI analysis based on a concatenation of all eight genes, but is restricted to the ex-type or authentic cultures from each of the accepted taxa. This analysis was performed without out-group taxa and clearly shows two clusters of closely related species, which we informally label the Musae clade and the Kahawae clade.
To better resolve relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades, a further set of BI analyses included eight genes and, wherever possible, several representative isolates of each of the accepted species. All eight gene sequences were concatenated to form a supermatrix for each clade. For the Musae clade, which included 32 isolates, the alignment was 4199 bp with the following gene boundaries: ACT: 1–292, TUB2: 293–1008, CAL: 1009–1746, CHS-1: 1747–2045, GAPDH: 2046–2331, GS: 2332–3238, ITS: 3239–3823, SOD2: 3824–4199. For the Kahawae clade, comprising 30 isolates, the alignment was 4107 bp, with gene boundaries as follows: ACT: 1–281, TUB2: 282–988, CAL: 989–1728, CHS-1: 1729–2027, GAPDH: 2028–2311, GS: 2312–3179, ITS: 3198–3733, SOD2: 3734–4107. The additional genes sequenced provided further support for our initial species delimitations, yielding better resolution for some closely related species. For instance, the highly pathogenic coffee berry isolates (referred to here as C. kahawae subsp. kahawae) were distinguished from other C. kahawae isolates.
Analyses based on concatenated datasets can obscure incongruence between individual gene trees. The low levels of support within some parts of the species-tree analysis (Figure 3) partially reflect incongruence between gene trees. The levels of support for the Kahawae clade and the Musae clade are strong (PP=1), but the species we accept within these clades have lower levels of support than those shown between other species outside of the clades. The scale bar in Figure 3 represents a time scale, calibrated at zero for the present day and at 1 for the last common ancestor (LCA) of the C. gloeosporioides and C. boninense species complexes. The separate species-tree analyses for the Musae and Kahawae clades provide a finer resolution of evolutionary history within each clade, with the time scale based on the same calibration as in Figure 3.
Brief morphological descriptions are provided for species that lack recent published descriptions, based on all specimens examined. Conidial sizes for all accepted species are summarized in Figure 7. Within a species, conidial sizes remain reasonably consistent across isolates, regardless of geographic origin or host. However, differences between species are often minor, with overlapping size ranges (see Figure 7). The shape of appressoria is generally consistent within a species, with some being simple in outline while others are complex and highly lobed.
Several species are characterized, in part, by the development of perithecia in culture. This includes four species in the Musae clade (Colletotrichum alienum, C. fructicola, C. queenslandicum, and C. salsolae) and three in the Kahawae clade (C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. ti). The size and shape of ascospores can serve as useful diagnostic features at the species level (refer to Figure 8). Most species have ascospores that are strongly curved and taper towards the ends, whereas in C. clidemiae and C. ti, the ascospores are more or less elliptic with broadly rounded ends and are either not curved or only slightly so. Individual isolates of these species may lose the ability to form perithecia, possibly due to cultural changes during storage.
In cultures of some species not known to form perithecia, large, dark-walled stromatic structures are present. These structures, often embedded in agar and less commonly found on the surface or among aerial mycelium, consist of a compact tissue of tightly tangled hyphae, differing from the pseudoparenchymatous, angular cells typical of perithecial walls. They exhibit a soft, leathery texture compared to the more brittle perithecia. These stromatic structures may develop an internal conidiogenous layer, and after conidia production, they might split open irregularly, folding back to form a stromatic, acervulus-like structure. Similar structures are also observed in some species within the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al., 2012b).
The macroscopic appearance of cultures can vary significantly within a species (e.g., C. fructicola and C. theobromicola), likely reflecting the different storage histories of the isolates examined. Prolonged storage, especially with repeated subculturing, leads to staling of cultures, with the aerial mycelium becoming dense and uniform in appearance and color. This results in a loss of conidial and perithecial production, as well as variability in growth rate (see Figure 9). In some cases, isolates from single ascospores or conidia display two markedly different cultural types, as noted for C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro.
Certain species appear to be host-specialized, such as C. horii, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, C. nupharicola, C. salsolae, C. ti, and C. xanthorrhoeae. However, the species most commonly isolated have broad host and geographic ranges, including C. fructicola, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto is frequently isolated from citrus species across various regions.
The referenced table includes multiple entries, each identifying specific strains of Colletotrichum along with their corresponding collection numbers, host plants, and geographic locations. For example, it lists strains collected from Fragaria in the USA and Canada, as well as strains from Malus and Dioscorea sourced from Nigeria and Brazil. Additionally, some entries highlight species like C. fructicola from Theobroma in Panama and various Limonium strains from Israel, illustrating the diversity of hosts and geographic distribution of these fungi. Each entry is systematically categorized, indicating the collection ID and relevant details about the specimen's origin.
Figure 1 presents a Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 156 isolates from the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. The tree was constructed using concatenated sequences of five genes: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS, each analyzed with a distinct model of DNA evolution. Nodes on the tree are annotated with Bayesian posterior probability values, with values of 0.5 or higher highlighted. The culture accession numbers are displayed alongside the host plant genus and country of origin. Ex-type and authentic cultures are emphasized in bold, including their original taxonomic names. Species delimitations are indicated with grey boxes. Colletotrichum boninense and C. hippeastri isolates serve as outgroups, and a scale bar indicates the expected number of changes per site.
The data presented includes a list of ICMP (International Collection of Micro-organisms from Plants) strains, their identifiers, associated species, and geographical locations. Each entry is labeled with an ICMP number followed by the scientific name of the species and its country of origin, primarily focusing on New Zealand.
Several strains, such as ICMP 18537 (Coprosma), ICMP 18530 (Vitex), and ICMP 18735 (Hedychium), originate from New Zealand.
Others include notable entries like ICMP 17915 (Coffea from Angola) and ICMP 17932 (Dryandra from South Africa).
The data indicates various species related to Coffea, including ICMP 17816 (C. kahawae subsp. kahawae from Kenya) and ICMP 17811 (Coffea from Malawi).
Some strains are marked with percentages that may represent the relative genetic similarity or other metrics, indicating their relationships within the species complex.
The analysis highlights the complex relationships among the species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex based on multigene concatenated Bayesian inference phylogenies. A total of 22 species and one subspecies are recognized within this complex. Notably, isolates of G. cingulata "f. sp. camelliae" appear as a distinct genetic group, although this group remains unnamed due to uncertainties about its relationship with C. camelliae. Additionally, some isolates, such as ICMP 18614 and ICMP 18616 from grape in Japan, as well as ICMP 18726 from pawpaw in the Cook Islands, hint at potentially unnamed species due to limited data.
Figure 1 describes the phylogenetic relationships of these isolates, illustrating clusters, namely the 'Musae clade' and the 'Kahawae clade.' The tree is constructed from concatenated sequences of several genes, showcasing their genetic distances through varying branch lengths.
In summary, the study encapsulates a wide range of ICMP strains, their origins, and genetic relationships, contributing to our understanding of these microorganisms and their diversity across different regions.
In the phylogenetic analysis depicted in Figure 4, a Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 32 selected isolates from the Musae clade of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex was constructed. This tree utilized concatenated sequences of multiple genes (ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, GS, ITS, and SOD2), each analyzed with a specific DNA evolution model. Additional details can be found in Figure 1. A corresponding species-tree was also generated from the same data, with a time scale set relative to the last common ancestor of the Musae clade and C. gloeosporioides s. str., as established in Figure 3.
Notably, DNA sequences from these isolates have been accessioned into GenBank, with specific accession numbers for various genes, including ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, and CHS-1.
Within the clades, phylogenetic support is limited due to the short branch lengths stemming from the low number of phylogenetically informative characters. However, both the Musae and Kahawae clades contain authentic cultures from long-accepted species. A pragmatic decision was made to minimize taxonomic disruption, recognizing monophyletic subclades within these clades as distinct species.
Fig. 5. A Bayesian inference phylogenetic tree of 30 selected isolates in the Kahawae clade of the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. The tree was built using concatenated sequences of the ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, GS, ITS, and SOD2 genes, each with a separate model of DNA evolution. Additional details can be found in Fig. 1. B. A species tree constructed from the same data, with the scale representing a clock set relative to the last common ancestor of the Kahawae clade and C. gloeosporioides s. str., as calibrated in Fig. 3.
The Musae clade includes C. fructicola, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. The Kahawae clade consists of C. cordylinicola, C. psidii, and C. kahawae, along with Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae.” To ensure a consistent taxonomic treatment of the subclades resolved within the Musae and Kahawae clades, several new species and one new subspecies are proposed. In the Musae clade, these are C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum, C. queenslandicum, and C. salsolae. In the Kahawae clade, the new entities are C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. ti. Other accepted species that are well-resolved in all of the gene trees include C. alatae, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. horii, C. theobromicola, and C. xanthorrhoeae.

Figure 9: A box plot depicts the diameter of cultures grown on PDA agar at 18 °C for 10 days. The dashed line indicates the mean culture size (61.56 mm) across the species complex (n = 719). It is important to note that the data is skewed by some fast-growing cultures that reached the agar plate diameter (85 mm) in under 10 days.
Colletotrichum aenigma B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563759.
Etymology: The name is derived from the Latin aenigma, reflecting the enigmatic biological and geographic distribution of this species.
Holotype: Collected in Israel on Persea americana, coll. S. Freeman Avo-37-4B, PDD 102233; ex-holotype culture ICMP 18608.
Colony Description: Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 30–35 mm in diameter after 10 days. The aerial mycelium is sparse and cottony, with a white color. The agar surface is uniformly pale orange (7A5) towards the center and colorless towards the edges. Conidia are not associated with well-differentiated acervuli and do not exhibit masses of conidial ooze. In reverse, the color is pale orange towards the center. Conidiogenous cells arise haphazardly from dense, tangled hyphae across the agar surface, appearing short-cylindric with a poorly differentiated conidiogenous locus. Conidia often germinate soon after release, occasionally forming appressoria, leading to a thin, compact layer of germinated, septate conidia, germ tubes, and appressoria across the central part of the colony surface. The conidia measure (12–) 14–15(–16.5) × (5–) 6–6.5(–7.5) µm (average 14.5 × 6.1 µm, n = 53), and are cylindric with broadly rounded ends. Appressoria measure 6–10 µm in diameter, subglobose, or may have a few broad lobes.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Known from only two collections: one from Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan and the other from Persea americana in Israel.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences are insufficient to separate C. aenigma from C. alienum and some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using TUB2 or GS.
Notes: While the biology of this species remains largely unknown, it has been found in two geographically separate regions, suggesting it may be widely distributed in the future. It is genetically distinct within the Musae clade and has a distinctive cultural appearance with sparse, pale aerial mycelium and lacking differentiated acervuli.
Other Specimens Examined: Japan, on Pyrus pyrifolia, coll. H. Ishii Nashi-10 (ICMP 18686).
Colletotrichum aeschynomenes B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563590.
Etymology: The name is based on C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes,” referring to the host from which this species was originally described.
Holotype: Collected in the USA, Arkansas, on Aeschynomene virginica stem lesions, coll. D. TeBeest 3-1-3, PDD 101995; ex-type culture ICMP 17673.
Colony Description: Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 25–35 mm in diameter after 10 days. The aerial mycelium is sparse, cottony, and white, with numerous acervuli, some having dark bases and orange conidial ooze. In reverse, the colony appears mostly colorless apart from the dark acervuli and orange conidial masses showing through the agar. Conidia measure (14–) 17–18.5(–20) × 4(–5) µm (average 17.6 × 4.1 µm, n = 30), are cylindric, straight, and taper slightly at both ends. Appressoria are mostly elliptic to subfusoid and deeply lobed. Perithecia were not observed.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Reported only from the USA, pathogenic to Aeschynomene.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not distinguish C. aeschynomenes from C. fructicola. These taxa are best distinguished using TUB2, GAPDH, or GS.
An isolate deposited as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes in CBS (CBS 796.72) by G.E. Templeton, one of the early researchers on this pathogen (Daniel et al., 1973), is genetically distinct from TeBeest 3.1.3 and has been identified by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue) as C. godetiae, a member of the C. acutatum complex. The strain we examined (TeBeest 3.1.3) matches genetically with another strain often cited in the C. gloeosporioides f. sp. aeschynomenes literature (Clar-5a = ATCC 96723) (GenBank JX131331). It is possible that two distinct species, both highly pathogenic to Aeschynomene in Arkansas, have been confused. A survey of additional Colletotrichum isolates that are highly virulent to Aeschynomene in Arkansas would clarify the interpretation of past literature on this pathogen. For example, C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” was initially reported as specific to Aeschynomene virginica (Daniel et al., 1973), while later studies reported isolates, putatively of the same taxon, to have a wider host range (TeBeest, 1988).
Cisar et al. (1994) reported fertile ascospores from crosses between isolates identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. aeschynomenes” and isolates of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae,” a pathogen of Jussiaea decurrens. The position of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” within our phylogeny is not known, but these taxa could prove useful for a better understanding of the biological differences between phylogenetically defined species of Colletotrichum.
Specimen examined: USA, Arkansas, on Aeschynomene virginica stem lesion, collected by D. TeBeest 3.1.3 (ICMP 17673 = ATCC 201874).

Etymology: Based on the invalid name C. gloeosporioides “f. alata” (Singh et al., 1966), referring to Dioscorea alata, the scientific name for yam.

Holotype: India, Rajasthan, Udaipur, on Dioscorea alata leaves and stems, collected by K.L. Kothari & J. Abramham, 1959, CBS H-6939; ex-type culture appears “stale,” with low, felted, dense pale grey aerial mycelium, orange agar surface showing through near the margin, and scattered dark-based acervuli with orange conidial masses. Conidia (14.5−)18–19.5(−23.5) × (4.5−)5−5.5(−6.5) µm (av. 18.9 × 5.2 µm, n = 40), cylindrical, straight, ends rounded, tapering towards the basal end. Appressoria mostly simple, elliptic to fusoid in shape, sometimes developing broad, irregular lobes, measuring about 7–13.5 × 5–10.5 µm. Perithecia not seen.

Known only from yam (Dioscorea alata), with records from Nigeria, Barbados, India, and Guadeloupe.
ITS sequences effectively distinguish C. alatae from all other taxa.
Anthracnose diseases of yam are prevalent in all regions where the host is cultivated (e.g., Winch et al. 1984; Prasad & Singh 1960; Singh et al. 1966; Abang et al. 2002, 2003). Isolates from diseased yam leaves exhibit significant morphological (Winch et al. 1984) and genetic diversity (Abang et al. 2002). Both authors employed a broad species concept, grouping all yam-sourced isolates under the single name C. gloeosporioides. In this paper, we recognize part of that diversity as representing a distinct species, newly described as C. alatae. The type specimen of C. alatae aligns with the SGG (slow growing grey) group identified by Abang et al. (2002), which was noted to be more pathogenic to yam than other morphological and genetic groups recognized within C. gloeosporioides. This includes Nigerian isolates from Abang et al. (2002), as well as isolates from Barbados (SAS8 and SAS9 from Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996), Guadeloupe (GenBank accession GQ495617), and India (CBS 304.67 and GenBank accession FJ940734), with no other host isolates identified.
Additional isolates sequenced from yam represented the FGS group identified by Abang et al. (2002) (e.g., Abang Cg22 = ICMP 18120, Abang Cg13 = ICMP 18125, Abang CgS6 = ICMP 18117, Abang CgS2 = ICMP 18121). This group is distinguished from the highly pathogenic SGG isolates by its faster growth in culture and shorter conidia (Abang et al. 2002). Two of these isolates (ICMP 18120, 18125) genetically match C. fructicola, while the others match C. siamense.
Several names have been historically assigned to Colletotrichum specimens associated with anthracnose of yam stems and leaves, including Gloeosporium pestis Massee, G. dioscoreae Sawada (nom. inval.; no Latin diagnosis), Colletotrichum dioscoreae Av.-Saccá 1917, and C. dioscoreae Tehon 1933. Additionally, Gloeosporium bomplandii Speg. was described from a host ambiguously identified as Dioscorea. Due to the broad genetic diversity among Colletotrichum species associated with diseased yam, the absence of cultures from these early type specimens, and uncertainty regarding the diversity they correspond to, we have opted not to apply these historical names to our newly recognized yam-specialized pathogen. The relationship between the post-harvest tuber rot, referred to as dead skin disease of yam (Abang et al. 2003; Green & Simmons 1994), and the Colletotrichum population associated with diseased foliage remains unclear.

Colletotrichum alienum B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov.
MycoBank MB563591. Figs 13, 14.
The name is derived from the biology of this species, which is confined to exotic hosts and is presumed to be a recent introduction to Australasia.
New Zealand, Auckland, Kumeu research orchard, Malus domestica fruit rot, collected by P.R. Johnston (C824) on 14 Aug. 1987, PDD 101996; ex-type culture ICMP 12071.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: This species is known only from Australia and New Zealand, where it is common on a wide range of introduced fruit crops.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not differentiate Colletotrichum alienum from some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using the CAL or GS genes.
Notes: Common on commercial fruit crops, this fungus was referred to as C. gloeosporioides Group A by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005).

New Species Description: Colletotrichum aotearoa B. Weir & P.R. Johnston, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800213. Figs 15, 16.
Etymology: The name is derived from the Māori name for New Zealand; most isolates from native New Zealand plants belong to this species.
Holotype: New Zealand, Auckland, Glen Innes, Auckland University campus, on Coprosma sp. incubated berries, collected by B. Weir, C1282.4, 30 Apr 2009, PDD 101076; ex-type culture ICMP 18537.
Colony Characteristics: Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA reach 70–85 mm in diameter after 10 days. Some isolates show restricted growth, measuring 50–55 mm in diameter with irregularly scalloped margins. Aerial mycelium is cottony to dense cottony, tufted near the center, and varies in color from grey to dark grey. Scattered, small, dark-based acervuli and large, globose, stromatic structures are partially embedded in the agar, sometimes splitting apart to form conidia. The reverse side typically exhibits pinkish-orange pigments, which vary in intensity and may be obscured by concentric bands of dark grey pigment.
Conidia measure (12–)16–17.5(–21.5) × (4.5–)5–5.5(–6.5) µm (average 16.9 × 5.2 µm, n = 216), are cylindrical, straight, with a broadly rounded apex and slightly tapering toward a subtruncate base, and are 0-septate and hyaline. Appressoria are variable in shape, ranging from simple to broadly lobed, sometimes appearing in groups or intercalary, measuring about 7–17 × 4–9.5 µm. Perithecia were not observed in culture.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: This species has been confirmed only from New Zealand, although GenBank records suggest C. aotearoa may also occur in China. In New Zealand, it is commonly found on a diverse range of native plants, acting both as a fruit rot pathogen and a leaf endophyte, and has also been isolated from the leaves of several species of naturalized weeds.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not differentiate C. aotearoa from several taxa within the Kahawae and Musae clades. However, this species can be distinguished using several other genes, including TUB2, CAL, GS, and GAPDH.
Colletotrichum aotearoa is a species associated with a range of isolates from weeds that have become naturalized in New Zealand. It is assumed to be a native species, exhibiting a broad host range among native plants and appearing to have jumped host to some weeds. Notably, it has never been found associated with cultivated plants or as a rot of cultivated fruit.
There is a possibility that C. aotearoa also occurs in China. ITS sequences from isolates obtained from Boehmeria in China (GenBank records GQ120479 and GQ120480) match exactly with a set of C. aotearoa isolates. Given that the between-species differences in the C. gloeosporioides complex are minimal, this match requires confirmation with additional genetic data. Silva et al. (2012b) referred to C. aotearoa as Undescribed Group 2.

Colletotrichum asianum Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Fungal Diversity 39: 96. 2009. Prihastuti et al. (2009) provide a description of this species.
Geographic distribution and host range: It is known to be associated with Mangifera indica in Australia, Colombia, Japan, Panama, the Philippines, and Thailand, and it has also been reported on Coffea arabica from Thailand.
Genetic identification: Colletotrichum asianum can be distinguished from all other taxa using any of the genes tested, including ITS.

Three earlier species, originally described from leaves rather than fruit of Mangifera, may provide earlier names for C. asianum and G. mangiferae (Kelkar, Gloeosporium mangiferae Henn. 1898 and G. mangiferae Racib. 1900). As with most substrates, several different species of Colletotrichum often occur on the same host, although type material for these species has not been examined in this study.

For example, Damm et al. (2012a, b, this issue) report members of the C. acutatum and C. boninense species complexes, with isolates Ku4 = ICMP 18575 and Ku8 = ICMP 18618 referred to as C. asianum by Hyde et al. (2009). However, these isolates are genetically distinct from C. simmondsii, C. fioriniae, and C. karstii, and belong to C. siamense based on our analyses.
Isolates from Capsicum reported by Than et al. (2008) as C. gloeosporioides Morphological Group 2 (e.g., isolates Ku4 = ICMP 18575) were referred to as C. asianum. The C. asianum protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090234, and the culture derived from the holotype is labeled “BCC” with no strain number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I4 in the Prihastuti et al. (2009) Table 1, but this number is not mentioned in the description. Culture BDP-I4 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study.
Specimens examined: Australia, New South Wales, Sextonville, on Mangifera indica, 1987 (IMI 313839 = ICMP 18696). Philippines, on Mangifera indica (MAFF 306627 = ICMP 18603).

Colletotrichum boehmeriae Sawada, Hakubutsu Gakkwai Kwaihô (Trans. Nat. Hist. Soc. Formosa) 17: 2. 1914.
Notes: Sawada (1922) provided an English translation of his original description. This species was described as a stem pathogen of Boehmeria nivea and remains recognized in this context (e.g., Li & Ma 1993). Wang et al. (2010) cite several GenBank accessions from isolates they identify as C. gloeosporioides, which cause severe disease in Boehmeria. Based on a comparison of the GenBank data with our ITS gene tree, these and other isolates from the same host deposited by the same authors (GQ120479–GQ120499) appear to represent three different taxa within the C. gloeosporioides complex — C. gloeosporioides s. str., C. aotearoa, and C. fructicola. Isolates representative of all three taxa are reportedly pathogenic on Boehmeria (Wang et al. 2010). The genetic relationships of these fungi need to be confirmed using additional genes.
Colletotrichum camelliae Massee, Bull. Misc. Inform. Kew. 1899: 91. 1899.
We have been unable to sample Colletotrichum isolates from tea exhibiting typical brown blight symptoms. There are four GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from tea: two from China (EU732732, FJ515007), one from Japan (AB218993), and another from Iran (AB548281). These isolates have been referred to as C. camelliae, C. crassipes, and C. gloeosporioides. Although only ITS sequences are available for these geographically widespread isolates, the DNA sequence of the Iranian isolate appears to match C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto, while the sequences from the other three isolates are all very similar to each other. The ITS sequence from these isolates matches that of CBS 232.79, which was collected from tea shoots in Java (GenBank JX009429). Both GAPDH and ITS sequences from CBS 232.79 (GenBank JX009417, JX009429) categorize this isolate within C. fructicola. Notably, CBS 571.88, isolated from tea in China and classified as Glomerella cingulata, is a Colletotrichum species outside of C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, based on ITS sequences (GenBank JX009424).
We tested the pathogenicity of CBS 232.79 and isolates of G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” using detached tea leaves, finding that only the G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” isolates were strong pathogens (unpublished data).
The genetic relationship between the pathogen of ornamental Camellia (here referred to as G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae”), isolates from tea with DNA sequence data in GenBank, and isolates associated with brown blight symptoms of tea remains unresolved. Additional isolates with known pathogenicity, collected from fields showing typical brown blight symptoms, are necessary to determine whether there are two distinct pathogens affecting Camellia: one for tea and another for ornamental varieties.
Other Colletotrichum species reported from tea include C. “theae-sinensis,” an invalid recombination of Gloeosporium theae-sinensis I. Miyake, proposed by Yamamoto (1960). Moriwaki and Sato (2009) summarized the taxonomic history of this name and transferred G. theae-sinensis to Discula based on DNA sequences. Sphaerella camelliae Cooke and its recombination Laestadia camelliae (Cooke) Berl. & Voglino were listed by von Arx & Müller (1954) as synonyms of Glomerella cingulata. This species is now accepted as Guignardia camelliae (Cooke) E.J. Butler ex Petch and is regarded as the causal agent of copper blight disease in tea (Spaulding 1958).
Thang (2008) placed C. camelliae in synonymy with C. coccodes, presumably based on the Species Fungorum synonymy (www.speciesfungorum.org, accessed 6 Oct 2010). Thang (2008) questioned this synonymy, noting differences between the descriptions of the two species provided by Massee (in Willis 1899) and Sutton (1980) respectively.
Colletotrichum caricae F. Stevens & J.G. Hall, Z. Pflanzenkrankh., 19: 68. 1909.
Notes: Placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957), C. caricae was listed as a separate species by Sutton (1992). It was described from the fruits and leaves of Ficus carica from the USA (Stevens & Hall 1909) but is poorly understood both morphologically and biologically. Its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, as well as to other Ficus-associated species such as Colletotrichum ficus Koord. and Glomerella cingulata var. minor (here placed in synonymy with C. fructicola), remains unknown.

C. gloeosporioides s. str. is associated with the Glomerella state on diseased stems of Ligustrum. An isolate of C. aotearoa (ICMP 18748) was collected from Ligustrum lucidum in New Zealand, but it was not linked to a stem lesion, and no C. aotearoa isolates were observed forming perithecia.
Glomerella cingulata var. brevispora Wollenw., Z. Parasitenk. (Berlin) 14: 260, 1949.
Notes: This name, described from fruit rots in Germany, has not been used since its introduction. No cultures are available, and its relationship to the C. gloeosporioides complex remains unknown.
Glomerella cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” (Dickens & Cook, 1989).
Notes: Dickens & Cook proposed this name for isolates morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides s. lat. that were highly pathogenic to the leaves and shoots of ornamental Camellia saluenensis hybrids, causing Camellia twig blight. The authors reported the fungus from plants imported into the UK from New Zealand and noted a similar disease reported in the UK from plants grown there.
We sequenced authentic isolates cited by Dickens & Cook as well as isolates pathogenic to Camellia saluenensis collected from the USA. These isolates are genetically, biologically, and morphologically similar. ITS sequences distinguish G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” from all other taxa in the C. gloeosporioides complex, providing strong genetic evidence to consider these isolates a distinct species within the C. kahawae clade. However, a new species is not proposed here due to the uncertain relationship between G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” and C. camelliae, the fungus responsible for brown blight of tea.
Dickens & Cook also reported two C. acutatum strains from ornamental Camellia species that were avirulent in tests with detached Camellia cv. Donation leaves. Strain IMI 351261, deposited in 1992 by R. Cook, is likely one of these strains. This strain was confirmed as belonging to the C. acutatum species complex and identified as C. lupini, which causes lupin anthracnose and is occasionally found on other hosts (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Another strain from Camellia reticulata in China belongs to C. fioriniae, also in the C. acutatum complex, while a strain from New Zealand (ICMP 10338) is C. boninense s. str. (Damm et al. 2012a, b, this issue).

Notes: See notes under Colletotrichum manihotis.
Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. fructicola.
Glomerella cingulata var. minor was described from Ficus in Germany, but Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) noted that the same fungus also occurred on other hosts in Europe, Africa, and America, including Malus and Coffea. Genetically, the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. minor (CBS 238.49) matches the type specimen of C. fructicola, although the culture itself appears to be stale, with slow growth and an irregularly scalloped margin (see images under C. fructicola at www.studiesinmycology.org). Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) used the name Gloeosporium elasticae Cooke & Massee for the conidial state of G. cingulata var. minor, with type specimens for both names coming from Ficus.
See also notes under C. queenslandicum.
Specimen examined: Germany, Berlin-Dahlem, from Ficus edulis leaf spot, May 1936 (ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. minor – CBS 238.49 = ICMP 17921).
Notes: Placed here in synonymy with C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro; see notes under this species.
Specimen examined: Germany, Berlin-Dahlem, on the stem of Hypericum perforatum, June 1937 (ex-holotype culture of Glomerella cingulata var. migrans – CBS 237.49).
Notes: Listed in Index Fungorum, this name was mentioned in an abstract but is invalid (no Latin description) and was never formally published. It was used to refer to the teleomorph of Colletotrichum orbiculare, which is not part of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). Glomerella lagenaria (Pass.) F. Stevens, a recombination of the anamorphic name Fusarium lagenarium Pass., has also been used to refer to this teleomorph. Correll et al. (1993) commented on the pathogenicity of cucurbit-associated strains that form a Glomerella state in culture, suggesting some confusion regarding the application of these names.
Notes: Both G. cingulata “f. sp. phaseoli” (e.g., Castro et al. 2006) and Glomerella lindemuthiana (e.g., Rodríguez-Guerra et al. 2005, as G. lindemuthianum) have been used for the teleomorph of Colletotrichum lindemuthianum in recent literature, with the two names placed in synonymy by Sutton (1992). This fungus is not part of the C. gloeosporioides complex (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue).
Notes: Not a member of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Sutton (1992) suggested using this name to refer to the teleomorph of Colletotrichum sublineola, although Crouch et al. (2006) note that C. sublineola has no known teleomorph.
= Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. clidemiae” (Trujillo et al. 1986).
Etymology: Based on the host reportedly susceptible to this species.
Holotype: USA, Hawai’i, Aiea, on Clidemia hirta leaf spot, collected by S.A. Ferreira & K. Pitz, 14 May 2010, PDD 101997; ex-type culture ICMP 18658.
Description: Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA reach 25 mm in diameter after 10 days, exhibiting grey, cottony, sparse aerial mycelium, with the surface of the colony displaying specific morphological characteristics.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Initially reported from Clidemia, which is native to Panama, this pathogen was subsequently introduced to Hawai’i. Genetically similar isolates have been found on native Vitis and Quercus species in Florida.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not effectively differentiate C. clidemiae from C. aotearoa. The two species can be best distinguished using ACT, GAPDH, or GS.
Notes: Isolates referred to as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. clidemiae” by Trujillo et al. (1986) were highly pathogenic to Clidemia, but not to other tested Melastomataceae species. No voucher cultures of the original isolates from Panama were preserved. However, recent specimens isolated from naturalized Clidemia hirta plants in Hawai’i, exhibiting typical disease symptoms, are genetically uniform and distinct within the Kahawae clade. Phylogenetic, biological, and morphological evidence supports the description of this fungus as a new species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.
A fungus isolated from a Vitis species in Florida, referred to as “Glomerella cingulata native host” by MacKenzie et al. (2007), is genetically similar to our isolates from Clidemia and is considered the same species. Data from MacKenzie et al. (2007) indicate that this fungus is present on both Vitis and Quercus in Florida. The micro-morphology of the isolates from Clidemia and Vitis that we examined is similar in terms of appressoria, conidia, and ascospores' size and shape. However, they differ in cultural appearance: the cultures associated with Vitis exhibit darker and denser aerial mycelium and a faster growth rate. This variation in cultural appearance is also observed in several phylogenetically defined species we recognize. To determine if the Clidemia-associated isolates are biologically distinct from the Vitis- and Quercus-associated isolates in Florida, pathogenicity tests are required.
Other Specimens Examined: USA, Florida, Sarasota, on Vitis sp. leaf, collected by S. MacKenzie (SS-Grape-12, 2002; ICMP 18706); Hawai’i, Aiea, on Clidemia hirta leaf spot, collected by S.A. Ferreira & K. Pitz, 14 May 2010 (ICMP 18659, ICMP 18660, ICMP 18661, ICMP 18662, ICMP 18663).
Colletotrichum coffeanum F. Noak, Z. Pflanzenkrankh. 11: 202. 1901.
Notes: Waller et al. (1993) discussed the use of the names Colletotrichum coffeanum and Gloeosporium coffeanum Delacr., highlighting geographic and biological differences between these species and the coffee berry pathogen C. kahawae. The relationships between C. coffeanum and G. coffeanum within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remain unclear. The two species were distinguished by Noak (1901) based on the presence or absence of setae in the acervuli. There is a broad range of C. gloeosporioides-like species found on coffee plants (see Waller et al.).

Colletotrichum cordylines Pollacci, Atti Ist. Bot. Univ. Pavia, Serie 2, 5: 44. 1899.
Notes: This species was described from leaves of Cordyline indivisa in a botanical garden in Italy; its genetic and biological status is currently unknown. Two Cordyline-associated species are accepted in this study.
Colletotrichum cordylinicola Phoulivong, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Mycotaxon 114: 251. 2011 [“2010”]. Fig. 22. Phoulivong et al. (2011) provide a detailed description.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: This species is known only from Cordyline in Thailand and Eugenia in Laos.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences clearly separate C. cordylinicola from all other species.
Notes: Phoulivong et al. (2011) report C. cordylinicola from both Cordyline (Agavaceae) and Eugenia (Myrtaceae). They noted that the isolate from Eugenia was not pathogenic to Cordyline and vice versa. Additionally, they showed that the specimens from the two hosts are genetically somewhat distinct, although they form a sister relationship among the taxa included in their analysis. The calmodulin gene tree generated from our sequence data, along with the sequences provided by Phoulivong et al. (2011) (GenBank accession HM470236), supports placing the isolates from Eugenia and Cordyline in the same species (unpublished data).
Colletotrichum cordylinicola is genetically distinct from a species associated with Cordyline leaf spots from New Zealand, which is described here as C. ti. For further details, see notes under C. cordylines.
Specimen Examined: Thailand, Chiang Mai, Sam Sai District, Maejo Village, on Cordyline fruticosa, collected by S. Phoulivong, 15 Mar. 2009 (ex-holotype culture – MFLUCC 090551 = ICMP 18579). Note that the ex-holotype culture was mistakenly cited as MFUCC 090551 by Phoulivong et al. (2011).
Colletotrichum crassipes (Speg.) Arx, Verh. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch., Afd. Natuurk., Sect. 2, 51(3): 77. 1957. Basionym: Gloeosporium crassipes Speg., Rivista Vitic. Enol. 2: 405. 1878.
Notes: Several isolates identified as Colletotrichum crassipes with sequences accessioned to GenBank actually belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. GenBank accessions identified as C. crassipes with publicly available cultures include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (STE-U 5302 = CBS 112988 – AY376529, AY376577, FN557348, FN557538, and FN599821; STE-U 4445 = CBS 112984 – AY376530, AY376578, FN557347, FN557537, and FN599820), along with several other species outside of the C. gloeosporioides complex (CBS 169.59 = IMI 309371 – AJ536230, FN557344, and FN599817; CBS 159.75 – FN557345 and FN599818; CBS 109355 – FN557346 and FN599819). Isolates without public collections include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (CORCS3 cited in Yang et al. (2011), HM584410, HM582002, HM585412), C. fructicola (strain 080912009 Jining, unpublished data, FJ515007), and a possibly undescribed species within the Kahawae clade (strain SYJM02, unpublished data, JF923835). Originally described from the berries of Vitis vinifera from Italy (Spegazzini 1878), the identity of C. crassipes remains unresolved. There is ongoing confusion regarding its morphology. Von Arx (1970) uses the name C. crassipes for fungi with rare setae, conidia measuring 22–34 × 6–8 µm (which somewhat matches the original description), and distinctly globose lobed appressoria. Conversely, Sutton (1980) presents a different morphological concept—setae are common (which Sutton claims are rare in the otherwise morphologically similar C. musae), with conidia measuring 10–15 × 4.5–6.5 µm (his concept of C. gloeosporioides is characterized by narrower conidia), and deeply lobed appressoria. The conidial width cited for C. gloeosporioides by Sutton (1980), at 3–4.5 µm, is narrower than what we have found for all taxa we accept within C. gloeosporioides s. lat., while his measurement for C. crassipes of 4.5–6.5 µm matches many recognized taxa. Several of these also exhibit deeply lobed appressoria.
Colletotrichum dracaenae Allesch., Rabenhorst’s Kryptogamen-Flora von Deutschland, Oesterreich und der Schweiz, Ed. 2, 1(7): 560. 1902.
Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, Phytopathology 21: 113. 1931.
Notes: This name is placed in synonymy with C. theobromicola. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. theobromicola.
The name C. fragariae was originally applied to isolates associated with a disease affecting strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) runners (stolons) and petioles in Florida (Brooks 1931). Although it was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957), it has continued to be referenced in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. Sutton (1992) accepted it as distinct, although he noted the confusion surrounding the application of the name. The designation of one of Brooks’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has provided a modern genetic basis for this name. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae is positioned in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a diverse range of hosts worldwide, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, which is regarded as an earlier name for C. fragariae as accepted in this paper.
Several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex inhabit diseased strawberry plants. MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) demonstrated that isolates genetically matching the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name, MacKenzie et al. considered this fungus as one among several species sometimes found on strawberries. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade are distributed globally across a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA has been identified (see Fig. 1). Further research will be necessary to determine whether strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys, this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.
Xie et al. (2010b) provide an example of the ongoing confusion surrounding the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberries. They noted that distinguishing between putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates using ITS sequences was challenging. They identified four groups of isolates, each with slightly different ITS sequences; two were classified as C. fragariae and two as C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates, they employed a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our alignment, one of their groups genetically matched C. tropicale, one matched C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matched C. fructicola, and one matched C. siamense. These relationships are based solely on ITS sequences, where genetic differences between some of these species are minimal and only suggest possible relationships. However, it is evident that none of the sequences from Xie et al. (2010b) match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. Additionally, there are several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012).
Specimen examined: USA, Florida, on Fragaria × ananassa, coll. A.N. Brooks, 1931 (ex-epitype culture – CBS 142.31 = ICMP 17927).

= Colletotrichum ignotum E.I. Rojas, S. A. Rehner & Samuels, Mycologia 102: 1331. 2010.
Prihastuti et al. (2009) and Rojas et al. (2010) provide descriptions.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Originally reported from coffee berries in Thailand (as C. fructicola) and as a leaf endophyte from several plants in Central America (as C. ignotum), the isolates we accept as C. fructicola are biologically and geographically diverse. They are known from various hosts, including Coffea in Thailand, Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan, Limonium in Israel, Malus domestica and Fragaria × ananassa in the USA, Persea americana in Australia, Ficus in Germany, Malus domestica in Brazil, Dioscorea in Nigeria, and Theobroma and Tetragastris in Panama.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not distinguish C. fructicola from C. aeschynomenes and some C. siamense isolates. These taxa are best distinguished using GS or SOD2.
Notes: Rojas et al. (2010) noted the occurrence of two distinct haplotype subgroups (A4-3 and A5-4) within their concept of C. ignotum. Our genetic analyses resolve the two clades representative of these two subgroups. However, together they are monophyletic within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides complex, and we retain them here as a single species. Both clades include isolates from a wide range of hosts across many countries and are similar in morphology and cultural appearance. The types of both C. fructicola and C. ignotum belong to the same haplotype subgroup.
The protologue of C. fructicola designates the holotype as MFLU 090228, but the culture derived from the holotype is listed as “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is mentioned as BDP-I16 in Table 1 of Prihastuti et al. (2009), but this number is not included in the description. Culture BDP-I16 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study and deposited as ICMP 18581.

Cannon et al. (2008) provide a description of the species.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Most isolates of C. gloeosporioides are associated with Citrus. In many parts of the world, this fungus is common on Citrus, but it also occurs on other hosts, including Ficus, Mangifera, Pueraria, and Vitis. The isolate reported as a pathogen of paper mulberry (Broussonetia papyrifera) by Yan et al. (2011) matches C. gloeosporioides s. str. genetically.
Genetic Identification: The ITS sequence separates C. gloeosporioides from all other species.
Notes: The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is currently used in two senses: one broad, genetically and biologically inclusive, more or less following von Arx (1957, 1970) and Sutton (1992), encompassing the whole species complex; and another strict sense, referring only to specimens that genetically match the epitype selected for this name by Cannon et al. (2008). Depending on the context, using the name in either sense can be useful. When referred to in a broad sense in this paper, it is denoted as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is often taxonomically linked to the teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (see notes under G. cingulata).

The genetic relationship of these species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remains unknown. See also notes in Damm et al. (2012b) under Colletotrichum annelatum.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. hyperici” (Harris 1993).
Notes: This name was first used by Harris (1993) for strains of C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Hypericum perforatum. Earlier studies by Hildebrand & Jensen (1991) found that the Hypericum pathogen was also pathogenic on several other plants. The genetic relationship of the Hypericum pathogen within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown. Notably, the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. migrans, a variety synonymized with C. kahawae subsp. cigarro, was also isolated from Hypericum.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” (Boyette et al. 1979).
Notes: Strains identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae” are highly pathogenic specialized pathogens of Jussiaea decurrens (Boyette et al. 1979). The genetic relationship of this taxon within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, or to Colletotrichum jussiaeae Earle, is unknown. Isolates pathogenic to Jussiaea have a similar conidial germination self-inhibitor profile to another isolate identified as C. fragariae (Tsurushima et al. 1995). The authentic isolate of C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae,” deposited as ATCC 52634, is not included in this study.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. malvae” (Makowski & Mortensen 1989).
Notes: Strains identified as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. malvae” were registered as a bioherbicide against round-leafed mallow in Canada (Makowski & Mortensen 1989). The fungus was subsequently recognized as belonging to the C. orbiculare species complex (Bailey et al. 1996).

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” (Killgore et al. 1999).
Notes: Killgore et al. (1999) reported that the isolates they recognized as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. miconiae” were highly specialized pathogens of Miconia calvescens, unable to infect the closely related Clidemia hirta. The original voucher cultures are no longer available (pers. comm., Robert Barreto). Recently collected isolates from Miconia at the type locality in Brazil have proven to be genetically diverse within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, with isolates belonging to both the Kahawae and Musae clades (unpubl. data). For now, the genetic position of this pathogen remains unresolved.

Notes: Originally described from Citrus aurantium from Portugal, this name has not been used since its initial description, and its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex remains unknown.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. ortheziidae” (Marcelino et al. 2008).
Notes: Marcelino et al. (2008) clearly show that the pathogen affecting Orthezia praelonga belongs in the C. acutatum species complex, despite referring to the fungus only as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. ortheziidae”. See also notes under C. nymphaeae in Damm et al. (2012a, this issue).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. pilosae” (Singh 1974).
Notes: First described from leaves of Bidens pilosa, this name has not been used since its description, and its genetic relationship to and within the C. gloeosporioides species complex is unknown.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Munaut, Mycol. Res. 106: 591. 2002.
Notes: This is placed in synonymy with C. theobromicola; see notes under C. theobromicola.
Irwin & Cameron (1978) and Munaut et al. (2002) described different diseases of Stylosanthes associated with Type A and Type B isolates of C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis. The two groups of isolates were distinguished morphologically by growth rate in culture and by conidial morphology. Compared with Type A, Type B isolates had a slower growth rate on PDA and more variable conidia in size and shape (Irwin & Cameron 1978). They were also distinguished genetically using RFLP and similar methods (e.g., Munaut et al. 1998, 2002). Munaut et al. (2002) used ITS1 sequences to demonstrate that C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis is related to an isolate identified as C. fragariae. We regard C. fragariae as a synonym of C. theobromicola, with putatively authentic Type A (HM335, C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. guianensis”) and Type B (HM336, C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis “f. sp. stylosanthis”) isolates also belonging to this species. From the available ITS1 sequence data, isolates regarded as typical of Type A (RAPD cluster I) and Type B (RAPD cluster II) by Munaut et al. (1998) all belong to C. theobromicola as we define the name; their RAPD cluster III isolate could be C. tropicale, and their RAPD cluster IV isolates are likely C. fructicola.
Sherriff et al. (1994), using ITS2 and partial 28S rDNA sequences, found that isolates representing C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis Type A and Type B were genetically distinct. However, their ITS2 sequences indicated that the putative Type B isolate in their study was, in fact, a member of the C. boninense species complex.

= Glomerella gossypii Edgerton, Mycologia 1: 119. 1909.
Notes: This species was originally described from the USA and was reported to cause disease symptoms on all parts of cotton plants, particularly the bolls (Southworth 1891, Edgerton 1909). Isolates identified as C. gossypii by Shear & Wood (1907) were associated with a Glomerella state in culture. Edgerton (1909) described Glomerella gossypii from diseased, mature cotton plants in the USA, discussing differences in ascospore shape between G. gossypii and fruit-rotting isolates of G. cingulata, noting that G. gossypii has elliptic, not curved ascospores. Von Arx (1957) considered C. gossypii to be a synonym of C. gloeosporioides, and von Arx & Müller (1954) regarded G. gossypii as a synonym of G. cingulata.
Modern authors have recognized two pathogens of cotton: C. gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides. Colletotrichum gossypii is reportedly the cause of cotton anthracnose, a damping-off disease of cotton seedlings, while C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides causes ramulosis, a disease that leads to abnormal branching of mature plants (Bailey et al. 1996, Silva-Mann et al. 2005). In a study based on ITS2 sequences, Bailey et al. (1996) found C. gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides to be genetically distinct, with both belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Silva-Mann et al. (2005) also distinguished the two taxa genetically, based on an AFLP analysis. The only DNA sequences available for isolates identified as C. gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides are ITS2 and the D2 region of the rDNA LSU, neither of which resolves their relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Whether the seedling pathogen regarded by Silva-Mann et al. (2005) and Bailey et al. (1996) as C. gossypii represents the species first described from cotton in the USA is unknown. The genetic relationship of these apparently biologically specialized fungi requires additional sequences to be generated from authentic isolates with known pathogenicity.
Weir & Johnston (2010) and Xie et al. (2010a) provide descriptions.
Geographic distribution and host range: This fungus is associated with fruit and stem diseases of Diospyros kaki from China, Japan, and New Zealand. Xie et al. (2010a) noted minor symptoms on inoculated fruit of Capsicum annuum, Musa acuminata, and Cucurbita pepo, but indicated that the fungus had never been associated with disease symptoms on these hosts in field conditions.
Genetic identification: ITS sequencing distinguishes C. horii from all other species.
Specimens examined: Refer to Weir & Johnston (2010).
Colletotrichum hymenocallidis Yan L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138. 2009.
Notes: This species is placed in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See additional notes and specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, which is also described from Hymenocallis, primarily based on multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony color. Although the gene selection was suitable for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates appeared genetically distinct from C. siamense. However, in our analysis, where the C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts worldwide, the authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically.
The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype, but the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium specimen GZAAS 080001 designated as the holotype.
Specimen examined: China, Guangxi, Nanning, on leaf spots of Hymenocallis americana, collected by Y.L. Yang, GZAAS 080001, 19 June 2008 (ex-holotype culture of C. hymenocallidis − CBS 125378 = ICMP 18642).

Colletotrichum jasmini-sambac Wikee, K.D. Hyde, L. Cai & McKenzie, Fungal Diversity 46: 174. 2011.
Notes: This species is placed in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense based on ITS, GAPDH, CAL, TUB2, and ACT gene sequences from the ex-holotype culture deposited in GenBank by Wikee et al. (2011). Wikee et al. (2011) discussed similarities between C. jasmini-sambac, C. siamense, and C. hymenocallidis, three species that are genetically close in their phylogenetic analysis. The broader range of isolates representing C. siamense in our analysis indicates that these species form a single, monophyletic clade that cannot be sensibly subdivided (see notes under C. siamense).
Specimen examined: Vietnam, Cu Chi District, Trung An Ward, on living leaves of Jasminum sambac, January 2009, collected by Hoa Nguyen Thi LLTA–01 (ex-holotype culture of C. jasmini-sambac – CBS 130420 = ICMP 19118).
Colletotrichum kahawae J.M. Waller & Bridge subsp. kahawae, Mycol. Res. 97: 993. 1993. Fig. 25. Waller et al. (1993) provide a description.
Geographic distribution and host range: This species is known only from Coffea in Africa.
Notes: Colletotrichum kahawae was proposed by Waller et al. (1993) to specifically refer to Colletotrichum isolates causing Coffee Berry Disease (CBD), allowing for a taxonomic distinction from other Colletotrichum species that can be isolated from coffee plants, including C. coffeanum (see notes under C. coffeanum). Colletotrichum kahawae is an apparently clonal population (Varzea et al. 2002), widespread on coffee in Africa, and exhibits a distinctive growth form and biology (Waller et al. 1993).
In this paper, C. kahawae sensu Waller et al. (1993) is reduced to subspecies. Based on sequences from the ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS genes, the coffee berry pathogen cannot be distinguished from isolates derived from a wide range of other hosts that are not pathogenic to coffee. These other isolates are referred to here as C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. We retain a distinct taxonomic label for the coffee berry pathogen to reflect its biosecurity importance. Besides its biology, C. kahawae subsp. kahawae can be distinguished metabolically and genetically using GS gene sequences. Waller et al. (1993) employed a metabolic test to demonstrate an inability to utilize either citrate or tartrate as a sole carbon source, which helped characterize isolates as C. kahawae. None of our C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates were able to utilize either citrate or tartrate, whereas all of the C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates were capable of utilizing one or both of these carbon sources (Weir & Johnston 2009). All C. kahawae subsp. kahawae isolates share a 22 bp deletion in the glutamine synthetase gene, which is absent in the C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro isolates. Note that one of the isolates, CBS 982.69, which is metabolically and genetically typical of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae, was reported by Gielink & Vermeulen (1983) to be non-pathogenic to coffee, though we have not independently verified this result.
The isolates accepted as C. kahawae subsp. kahawae show two cultural types. One type matches the description provided by Waller et al. (1993), characterized by slow-growing, darkly pigmented cultures with conidia developing primarily in the aerial mycelium. The second cultural type grew even more slowly, exhibited little or no pigmentation within the agar, and had a colony surface covered with numerous acervuli and orange conidial masses. Metabolically and genetically, both cultural types are identical, and pathogenicity tests revealed that the non-pigmented isolates caused CBD (unpublished data, D. Silva, Centro de Investigação das Ferrugens do Cafeeiro). Rodriguez et al. (1991) reported further variations in cultural appearance among isolates causing CBD.
Figure 25 Description: The figure illustrates Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. kahawae with several labeled components. It includes images of different isolates: A and E represent ICMP 17905 (ex IMI 361501), while B and C depict ICMP 17816 (ex IMI 319418 – ex-holotype culture) and ICMP 17915 (ex CBS 982.69), respectively. The images showcase appressoria in A and B, conidia in C, and cultures on PDA with ten days of growth from single conidia in D and E, viewed from above and below. The scale bar for C is 20 µm, which also applies to A through C.
Based on ITS sequences, most of the accessions in GenBank identified as C. kahawae and isolated from coffee match our concept of C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. There are two exceptions: AF534468 (from Malawi) and AY376540 (STE-U 5295 = IMI 319424 = CBS 112985, from Kenya). The Kenyan isolate was cited as C. kahawae in Lubbe et al. (2004). Based on the ITS sequences and the TUB2 sequence from isolate STE-U 5295 (AY376588), these isolates represent C. siamense.

Etymology: Based on the title of the Jim Jarmusch movie “Coffee and Cigarettes,” referring to the close genetic relationship between C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro and the coffee pathogen C. kahawae subsp. kahawae; "ciggaro" is Portuguese for "cigarette."
Holotype: Australia, on Olea europaea, coll. V. Sergeeva UWS124, 1989, PDD 102232; ex-type culture ICMP 18539.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA are 75–85 mm in diameter after 10 days for most isolates, while the ex-holotype culture of G. cingulata var. migrans is 48–49 mm in diameter. The aerial mycelium is cottony, grey, and dense, with some isolates showing dark stromatic masses and orange conidial ooze visible through the mycelium from the agar surface. The reverse side of the agar displays pinkish-orange pigments (6B4–7B4), irregular scattered black spots, and varying levels of dark grey to green-grey pigments (4C2–5D4), sometimes arranged in discrete sectors.
Conidia form on dark-based acervuli, measuring (12–) 16–19.5(–29) × (4.5–) 5(–8) µm (average 17.8 × 5.1 µm, n = 214), appearing cylindrical, straight, with rounded apices, and often tapering slightly toward the base. Appressoria are typically cylindrical to fusoid in shape and deeply lobed. Numerous perithecia form tightly packed clumps, with individual perithecia being globose and small, approximately 250 µm in diameter, featuring a short ostiolar neck. Asci measure 55–100 × 10–12 µm and are 8-spored. Ascospores measure (13.5–) 17.5–20(–24) × (4–) 4.5–5(–6.5) µm (average 18.8 × 4.8 µm, n = 121), are gently curved, tapering to narrow, rounded ends, with the widest point usually towards one end of the spore.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known from Australia, Germany, New Zealand, and South Africa. The host and geographic range of the isolates we accept in C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro are broad.
Genetic identification: ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS sequences match those from C. kahawae subsp. kahawae. The two subspecies can be distinguished by GS sequences, and collectively, they can be differentiated from all other species using ITS sequences alone.
Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii was described by Shear (1907) for a fungus isolated from cranberry that was morphologically identical to isolates from apple and other hosts but appeared to be biologically distinct (Shear 1907; Shear & Wood 1913). A putative authentic isolate of this species, deposited by Shear in CBS in 1922, matches C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro genetically. Polashock et al. (2009) discussed the diversity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with North American cranberry fruit rots, reporting that C. kahawae requires additional genes to be sequenced due to the close match between their isolates and C. kahawae. The incorporation of their ITS sequences into our alignment confirms this.
Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro was referred to as C. gloeosporioides Group B by Johnston & Jones (1997) and Johnston et al. (2005), and as Undescribed Group 1 by Silva et al. (2012b). Isolates of C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro from New Zealand showed two highly divergent growth forms. One was typical of the “wild type” with cottony, grey to dark grey aerial mycelium and dark-based acervuli. The other form lacked aerial mycelium, with the colony surface covered in small, pale-based acervuli exuding bright orange conidial ooze, appearing bright orange from the conidial ooze in reverse. Although this bright conidial cultural type is common from single ascospores, it is rarely formed by isolates from nature (unpublished data). Similar dimorphic cultural types have also been observed in single ascospore isolates from a member of the C. boninense complex, C. constrictum (unpublished data, P.R. Johnston).
Other specimens examined include a sample from Brazil, on leaves of Miconia sp., collected by R. Barreto (RWB1054, 2009; ICMP 18728), and another from Berlin-Dahlem, Germany, on the stem of Hypericum perforatum, collected in June 1937 (ex-holotype culture of Glomerella cingulata var. migrans).
The figures referenced include various cultures of Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro and Colletotrichum musae. For Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro, the cultures (ICMP 12952, ICMP 17932, ICMP 17931, etc.) illustrate different morphological features such as asci, ascospores, appressoria, setae, and conidia. Scale bars indicate sizes, with A and E having a scale of 20 µm applicable across multiple figures. The cultures were grown on PDA for 10 days from single conidia, showcasing growth from both above and below.
For Colletotrichum musae, the figures (ICMP 12930, ICMP 18600, ICMP 17817) also depict various cultural aspects similar to those in the previous group, emphasizing growth characteristics from single conidia on PDA for the same duration.

Colletotrichum manihotis Henn., Hedwigia 43: 94. 1904.
Notes: Anthracnose is an important disease of cassava (e.g., Chevaugeon 1956, Makambila 1994, Fokunang et al. 2000, Owolade et al. 2008). It is variously referred to as Colletotrichum manihotis, Gloeosporium manihotis Henn., Glomerella manihotis (Sacc.) Petr., Glomerella cingulata "f. sp. manihotis," or C. gloeosporioides "f. sp. manihotis." The original descriptions of both C. manihotis and Gloeosporium manihotis describe species with short, broad conidia (8–15 × 4–6 µm). Chevaugeon (1956) regarded all of these cassava-associated fungi as conspecific. However, based on Fokunang et al. (2000), a morphologically diverse set of Colletotrichum isolates are associated with diseased plants. There are three GenBank accessions of Colletotrichum from cassava, all from China. Although only ITS sequences are available for these isolates, they appear to represent a single, distinct species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. The relationship between these Chinese isolates and cassava-associated isolates from other parts of the world is unknown.

Geographic distribution and host range: Found in association with fruit lesions of Musa spp. in many regions.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences separate C. musae from all other species.
Notes: Colletotrichum musae was originally described from North Carolina (Berkeley 1874), and the name was recently epitypified by Su et al. (2011) based on a specimen collected in Florida (ex-epitype culture CBS 116870). Su et al. (2011) cite several strains from Thailand that align with their concept of C. musae. Isolates from anthracnose symptoms on banana fruit from various parts of the world are consistent with our study. These isolates form a well-supported clade within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, show low levels of genetic differentiation, and, based on ITS sequences, align with C. musae sensu Sreenivasaprasad et al. (1996), Nirenberg et al. (2002), and Shenoy et al. (2007). The morphology in culture agrees with the description by Sutton & Waterston (1970).
We have not observed a Glomerella state in culture, nor was one mentioned by Su et al. (2011). However, Rodriguez & Owen (1992) reported rare production of perithecia from crosses between two of 14 isolates identified as C. musae. It is unknown whether the isolates studied by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) genetically match our concept of C. musae, but it is possible that this species behaves similarly to some species in the C. acutatum complex, where the sexual morph can be generated in culture under suitable conditions (Guerber & Correll 2001). The name "Glomerella musae," used by Rodriguez & Owen (1992) and Krauss et al. (2001), has never been validly published.
More than one species of Colletotrichum has been found in association with rotting banana fruit. From isolates with well-characterized sequence data, these include a species belonging to...

C. gloeosporioides. The status of Glomerella musarum Petch, which was described from banana leaves and cited as the teleomorph of C. musae by Sutton (1992) and Hyde et al. (2009), as a synonym of C. musae in the context we use here is uncertain. However, it seems unlikely due to the rare production of perithecia by this species.

Colletotrichum nupharicola D.A. Johnson, Carris & J.D. Rogers, Mycol. Res. 101: 647. 1997. Fig. 29. Johnson et al. (1997) provide a description.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from the USA, found on aquatic plants Nuphar and Nymphaea spp.
Genetic identification: One of the two ITS haplotypes of C. nupharicola is identical to C. queenslandicum. All other genes effectively distinguish this species from others in the C. gloeosporioides complex.
Notes: Sequence data from the ex-holotype culture of C. nupharicola places it within the C. gloeosporioides complex, genetically close to C. fructicola and C. alienum in the Musae clade. This species appears to be host-specific and is characterized by slow growth in culture and large conidia (Johnson et al. 1997). Johnson et al. (1997) also compare C. nupharicola with another water plant pathogen, C. nymphaeae, which is epitypified and shown to belong to the C. acutatum species complex by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue).

Colletotrichum psidii Curzi, Atti dell’Istituto Botanico dell’Università di Pavia, ser. 3, 3: 207. 1927. Fig. 30.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA reach 58–63 mm in diameter after 10 days. The aerial mycelium is dense, cottony to felted, and uniform in height, appearing white to off-white; in reverse, it is uniformly pale creamy yellow (2A2–2A3) or may develop a dull greyish yellow (2D2–2E2) towards the center. No conidiogenous cells or conidia are observed.
Geographic distribution and host range: Known from a single isolate from Psidium in Italy.
Genetic identification: Although derived from only one isolate, ITS sequences effectively distinguish C. psidii from all other taxa.
Anthracnose diseases have been noted in Psidium spp. (guava) from several tropical regions worldwide (e.g., MacCaughey 1917, Venkatakrishniah 1952, Liu 1972, Misra 2004). It is likely that several Colletotrichum species are associated with guava fruit rots. Whether the fungus described by Curzi from an Italian botanical garden represents one of the species causing guava diseases in the tropics is unknown. All other members of the Kahawae clade are predominantly tropical, suggesting that this fungus may have been introduced to Italy along with its host plant. Misra (2004) uses C. psidii to refer to a Colletotrichum species with curved conidia.
Another species has been described from this host, Glomerella psidii (basionym Gloeosporium psidii), but the relationship of this species to C. psidii remains unclear. A new species on Psidium guajava, C. guajavae, which belongs to the C. acutatum species complex, is described elsewhere in this volume (Damm et al. 2012a).
Specimen examined: Italy, Rome, on Psidium sp., collected by M. Curzi (authentic culture of C. psidii – CBS 145.29 = ICMP 19120).

Basionym: Gloeosporium psidii Delacr., Bull. Soc. Mycol. France. 19: 144. 1903.
Notes: Sheldon (1906) produced perithecia in culture from isolates he considered typical of Gloeosporium psidii, and on this basis, he recombined the species described by Delacroix (1903) in Glomerella. The relationship of G. psidii to Colletotrichum psidii, also described from guava, is not known. See notes under C. psidii.
Colletotrichum queenslandicum B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., nom. nov. et stat. nov. MycoBank MB563593.
Etymology: Named after the region from which the type specimen of this species was collected.
Holotype: Australia, Queensland, Ormiston, on Carica papaya, collected by J.H. Simmonds, Oct. 1965, IMI 117612.
Epitype: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica papaya, collected by J.H. Simmonds 11663C, Sep. 1965; epitype designated PDD 28797; ex-epitype culture ICMP 1778.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 62–74 mm in diameter after 10 days, exhibiting either dense, cottony, uniform, grey aerial mycelium or lacking aerial mycelium. Towards the center of the colony, numerous small acervuli with dark bases and orange conidial ooze can be seen. In reverse cultures with abundant aerial mycelium, the color is uniformly dark grey (1F2), while those with little aerial mycelium exhibit a pinkish-brown pigment within the agar (8B4). The dark bases of the acervuli and the color of the conidial ooze are visible through the agar. Conidia measure (12–) 14.5–16.5(–21.5) × (3.5–) 4.5–5(–6) µm (average 15.5 × 4.8 µm, n = 96), are cylindrical, straight, and may be slightly constricted near the center, with ends broadly rounded. Appressoria are about 6–12 µm in diameter, globose to short-cylindric, and rarely lobed. Perithecia have not been observed.
Geographic distribution and host range: This species is known from Carica papaya and Persea americana in Queensland, Australia, and from Coffea berries in Fiji. Simmonds (1965) also reported this fungus from Mangifera indica, Malus sylvestris, and many other hosts in Australia.
Notes: The ex-type cultures cited by Simmonds (1968) are no longer stored at BRIP in Queensland (R. Shivas, pers. comm.) and are presumably lost. However, we do have two cultures identified as C. gloeosporioides var. minus by Simmonds, isolated from the same host and locality as the holotype (Simmonds isolates 16633C and 1647A2), which were sent to Joan Dingley in 1965 and are currently stored in the ICMP culture collection. The culture selected here as epitype (Simmonds 11663C = ICMP 1778) matches Simmonds's (1965) description of this fungus as having "an abundance of aerial mycelium in culture." Our conidial measurements from ICMP 1778 and 1780 are broader than those provided by Simmonds (1965), although he notes that "confusion can occur between narrower strains of C. gloeosporioides and broader strains of C. gloeosporioides var. minus." Simmonds (1965) also mentions that perithecia may rarely be observed in cultures of some isolates.
The isolates accepted here as C. queenslandicum are genetically distinct within the Musae clade of C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Colletotrichum minus Zimm. (1901) necessitates the proposal of a new name at the species rank.
Simmonds (1965) considered C. gloeosporioides var. minus to be the conidial state of Glomerella cingulata var. minor Wollenw. Wollenweber & Hochapfel (1949) used the name Gloeosporium elasticae Cooke & Massee for the conidial state of G. cingulata var. minor, with the type specimens for both names originating from Ficus. Simmonds (1965) noted the impossibility of transferring G. elasticae to Colletotrichum because Colletotrichum elasticae had already been published for a different fungus. Rather than proposing a new name for Gloeosporium elasticae, he described C. gloeosporioides var. minus as a new variety, with a different type specimen. Glomerella cingulata var. minor is genetically distinct from the specimen Simmonds chose as the type of C. gloeosporioides var. minus; see notes under G. cingulata var. minor.
Other specimens examined: Australia, Queensland, Brisbane, on Carica sp., collected by J.H. Simmonds 16347A2 (ICMP 1780, dried culture stored as PDD 28797); Queensland, Home Hill, on Persea americana, collected by L. Coates 22516, Feb. 1983 (ICMP 12564). Fiji, on Coffea sp. berry, collected by R. Gounder, Apr. 1988 (ICMP 18705).
Glomerella rufomaculans var. vaccinii Shear, Bull. Torrey Bot. Club. 34: 314. 1907.
Notes: This variety is placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum kahawae subsp. ciggaro. Refer to notes under C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. Notably, Saccardo & Trotter (1913) placed Shear’s variety in Glomerella fructigena (Clint.) Sacc., a rarely used species name that was placed in synonymy with G. cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954).
Specimen examined: USA, on Vaccinium macrocarpum leaves, collected by C.L. Shear, Apr. 1922 (authentic isolate of G. rufomaculans var. vaccinii – CBS 124.22 = ICMP 19122).
Colletotrichum salsolae B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov. MycoBank MB563589.
This is synonymous with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides “f. sp. salsolae” (Berner et al. 2009).
Etymology: The name is derived from C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. salsolae,” referring to the host from which this fungus was originally collected.
Holotype: Hungary, on Salsola tragus, collected by D. Berner [specimen from plants inoculated with strain 96-067, originally collected by I. Schwarczinger & L. Vajna on Salsola tragus from Bugac, near Kiskunsag National Park, 1996], BPI 878740; ex-holotype culture ICMP 19051.
Colonies grown from single conidia on Difco PDA measure 38–42 mm in diameter after 10 days, with sparse, cottony, pale grey aerial mycelium.
In the colony, a dark layer resembling acervulus forms a more or less continuous olivaceous margin. The conidia measure (10–) 14–16.5(–20.5) × (4.5–) 5.5–6(–7.5) µm (average 15.3 × 5.8 µm, n = 24), exhibiting deep orange-brown conidial masses and numerous highly variable setae. The reverse side appears dark purplish-black near the center of the colony. The conidia are subglobose to long-cylindric in shape, with the apex usually broadly rounded and a small truncate scar at the base. Conidiogenous cells are 13–18 × 4–6.5 µm, phialidic, and taper at the apex to a narrow point, often with dark brown material encrusting the wall at the base. Appressoria are sparsely developed, cylindric to elliptic and simple; many are partially developed, resembling those with dark, thick walls, which also have an appressorial pore, although these walls remain thin and only slightly pigmented. Perithecia were not observed.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Colletotrichum salsolae is known from throughout the range of Salsola tragus (Berner et al. 2009) and has been reported in nature only from Salsola spp.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences of C. salsolae are very close to those of C. alienum and some C. siamense isolates. Distinguishing these species is possible using TUB2 or GAPDH markers.
Notes: Isolates of C. gloeosporioides pathogenic to Salsola tragus were reported by Schwarczinger et al. (1998) and referred to as C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. salsolae” by Berner et al. (2009). Although mildly pathogenic to a wide range of hosts in glasshouse pathogenicity tests, this fungus causes severe disease primarily on Salsola spp., except for S. orientalis, S. soda, and S. vermiculata (Berner et al. 2009).
Colletotrichum salsolae belongs to the Musae clade and, while genetically close to several other species, it is biologically and morphologically distinctive.
Other Specimens Examined: An additional isolate of the strain selected as the holotype was recovered from inoculated Glycine max plants in Hungary (MCA 2498 = CBS 119296).
Colletotrichum siamense was described by Prihastuti, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde in Fungal Diversity 39: 98 (2009). It is also related to Colletotrichum jasmini-sambac (Wikee, K.D. Hyde, L. Cai & McKenzie, Fungal Diversity 46: 174, 2011) and Colletotrichum hymenocallidis (Yan L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138, 2009).
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: Colletotrichum siamense was originally described from coffee in Thailand, but it has a biologically and geographically diverse concept, being found on many hosts across various tropical and subtropical regions.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not reliably separate C. siamense from C. alienum, C. fructicola, or C. tropicale. These species are best distinguished using CAL or TUB2 markers.
Based on matching translation elongation factor (TEF) and TUB2 sequences, isolates referred to by Rojas et al. (2010) as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2 also represent C. siamense. Note that TEF data was excluded from our phylogenetic analyses because the TEF gene tree was often incongruent with the trees from the other genes we sequenced. For example, compare our isolate ICMP 17797 (GenBank GU174571) with isolates cited by Rojas et al. (2010) as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2, V1H1_1 (GenBank GU994297) and 7767 (GenBank GU994298).
The protologue for C. siamense designates the holotype as MFLU 090230, but the culture derived from the holotype is referred to as “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I2 in Table 1 of Prihastuti et al. (2009), but this is not included in the species description. Strain BDP-I2 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study and is deposited as ICMP 18578.

Colletotrichum theobromicola, as accepted here, includes the pathogens of Stylosanthes previously referred to as C. gloeosporioides f. Additionally, it encompasses several putatively specialized pathogens, including those affecting stylosanthis (Munaut et al. 2002). Future studies may indicate that the strawberry runners described by Brooks (1931) as C. fragariae should be segregated based on their pathogenicity.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides f. gloeosporioides and f. stylosanthis were distinguished by Munaut et al. (2002) based on specific isolates. The species complex is characterized by genetic variability, with some isolates exhibiting a specific string of C's in the ITS1 region.

F depicts conidia, G shows conidiogenous cells, and H presents ascospores. Scale bars: A = 1 mm, C = 20 µm. The scale bar for A applies to A–B, and the scale bar for C applies to C–H.
Rojas et al. (2010) provide descriptions for their concept of the ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola, as well as for C. fragariae as discussed by MacKenzie et al. (2008). Variations in the genetic makeup of isolates are noted, with some displaying three additional C's instead of two. Cultural appearances of isolates vary widely, from the very dark ex-neotype isolate of C. theobromicola to the slow-growing, pale-colored C. gloeosporioides f. stylosanthis. None of the examined isolates formed perithecia in culture, and all had conidia that taper slightly towards each end—more pronounced at the base—consistent with the description of C. fragariae by Gunnell & Gubler (1992). Some of their isolates were included in MacKenzie et al. (2008), supporting our genetic concept of C. fragariae.

Colletotrichum ti B. Weir & P.R. Johnst., sp. nov.
MycoBank MB563594. Figs 35, 36.
Etymology: The name is derived from the Maori term for Cordyline australis, tī.
Holotype: New Zealand, Taupo, on Cordyline sp., collected by J.M. Dingley (65187), Sep. 1965, PDD 24881; ex-holotype culture ICMP 4832.
Morphology: Leaf spots are oblong to elliptic, measuring up to about 1 × 2 mm, and may coalesce when close together. They appear pale grey and necrotic at the center with a reddish margin. Acervuli are numerous, with a base that can range from pale to dark grey, featuring scattered dark brown setae measuring about 50–80 µm long. Perithecia were not observed on the infected leaves. Freshly isolated colonies on Difco PDA exhibit a diameter of 50–55 mm after 10 days, with slightly irregular and feathery margins. Aerial mycelium is absent in the ex-holotype culture; when present, it is fine, cottony, and pale grey, with a dark center and a pale pinkish-orange (7A6) margin. Conidia form over the entire culture, mostly without well-differentiated acervuli, and setae are not observed. The reverse side shows purple (12E3) near the center and orange outside, sometimes with concentric grey pigment rings. Conidiogenous cells are cylindrical, measuring mostly 15–25 × 3.5–4.5 µm, densely packed in palisade towards the center and with a looser structure towards the margin, exhibiting irregular branching. Conidiogenous loci are located at the apex and often at the septa.
Conidia measure (11.5–) 14–17.5(–23.5) × (4–)5–5.5(–7.5) µm (average 16 × 5.2 µm, n = 53), are cylindrical with broadly rounded ends, sometimes tapering towards the base. Appressoria are typically narrow-cylindric, often tapering towards the apex and occasionally irregularly lobed. Perithecia develop in small numbers in culture after approximately 4 weeks, appearing solitary and scattered, dark-walled, globose with a well-developed tapering ostiolar neck.
Asci measure (60–) 65–75(–78) × (10–) 11(–12) µm (average 69.6 × 11 µm, n = 5), are cylindrical to subfusoid, and 8-spored. Ascospores measure (14.5–) 15.5–16.5(–19) × (4.5–) 5–5.5(–6) µm (average 15.9 × 5.2 µm, n = 18), broad-cylindric with broadly rounded ends that do not taper, and in side view, they are mostly flat on one side and often slightly curved.
Geographic Distribution and Host Range: This species is known only from Cordyline spp. in New Zealand.
Genetic Identification: ITS sequences do not differentiate C. ti from C. aotearoa. However, the two species can be distinguished using TUB2 or GAPDH.
Notes: As a member of the Kahawae clade, this fungus causes leaf spots on Cordyline spp. in New Zealand. It is genetically distinct from C. cordylinicola, which is described from Cordyline fruticosa in Thailand. Based on the published description of C. cordylinicola (Phoulivong et al. 2011), the two fungi are morphologically similar. Inoculation tests using culture ICMP 5285, when freshly isolated (J.M. Dingley, unpublished data), demonstrated pathogenicity to Cordyline australis, forming spots on leaves 2 weeks after inoculation, with no symptoms observed on apple, even after wounding.
The appearance of cultures varies between isolates. The J.M. Dingley cultures, first isolated in the mid-1960s, exhibit dense, felted aerial mycelium and limited conidial production. Notably, one of these cultures shows a much slower growth rate compared to more recent collections.

Colletotrichum tropicale E.I. Rojas, S.A. Rehner & Samuels, Mycologia 102: 1331. 2010. Refer to Fig. 37 for details. Rojas et al. (2010) provide a comprehensive description.
Geographic distribution and host range: Rojas et al. (2010) noted that C. tropicale has been isolated from a diverse range of hosts in tropical forests of America, including rotting fruit and leaf endophytes. Additionally, we include an isolate from tropical Japan, sourced from Litchi chinensis leaves.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not effectively distinguish C. tropicale from some isolates of C. siamense or C. queenslandicum. It is best differentiated using the TUB2, CHS-1, GS, or SOD2 genes.
Notes: Colletotrichum tropicale is genetically similar to C. siamense, with both species sharing several morphological features. These include slow growth in culture, short and broad conidia with broadly rounded ends that are often slightly constricted near the center, and simple appressoria.
Figures 36 and 37 illustrate cultures of Colletotrichum ti and C. tropicale, respectively, showing 10 days of growth from single conidia on PDA, with images from both above and below.

Colletotrichum xanthorrhoeae R.G. Shivas, Bathgate & Podger, Mycol. Res. 102: 280. 1998. Refer to Fig. 38 for a description. One of the isolates examined (ICMP 17820) formed fertile perithecia in culture, a characteristic not mentioned in the original description. These perithecia are dark-walled and globose with a prominent, narrow neck. The wall consists of several layers of pseudoparenchymatous cells (8–15 µm in diameter), with multiple layers of densely packed hyphae on the outside. Asci measure 75–100 × 10–12 µm and are 8-spored. Ascospores range from (17–)18.5–20(–22) × (5–)5.5–6 µm (average 19.4 × 5.6 µm, n = 24), displaying an elliptic shape that tapers to narrow, rounded ends, appearing flattened on one side in side view but generally not curved.
Genetic identification: ITS sequences distinctly separate C. xanthorrhoeae from all other species.
Notes: This pathogen of Xanthorrhoea exhibits a unique morphology, characterized by a very slow growth rate in culture and large conidia that taper towards the basal end. The shape of the ascospores is distinctive compared to most taxa within the C. gloeosporioides group, which typically have bent or curved ascospores.
Specimens examined: Australia, Western Australia, Melville, on Xanthorrhoea preissii leaf spots, collected by F.D. Podger in January 1994 (ex-holotype culture − BRIP 45094).
The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.
The species we accept are based on a phylogenetic species concept, with all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal clades are recognized as named species. In most cases, any well-supported within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the multigene phylogeny is not resolved consistently across all gene trees. This lack of congruence between gene trees indicates that the diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although concatenating gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it can mask discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach (Figs. 3, 4B, 5B), combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesized to represent a single species, allowing for the estimation of the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates. Fig. 3 shows the results of such an analysis for the C. gloeosporioides complex, while Figs. 4B and 5B illustrate relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades, respectively, at an expanded scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae clades. This may be because, while species-tree algorithms account for incomplete lineage sorting (Heled & Drummond 2010, Chung & Ané 2011), most do not compensate for horizontal gene transfer, reassortment, or introgression. Hybridization could also result in discordant gene phylogenies. Hybrids are known in the C. acutatum complex, such as Glomerella acutata, a hybrid formed by crossing C. acutatum and C. fioriniae strains in the laboratory, as well as a putative hybrid strain collected from terminal crook disease on Pinus in New Zealand, where both species coexist in nature (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Hybrids also form in the C. gloeosporioides complex, such as the Carya and Aeschynomene populations discussed by Cisar et al. (1994), which are more or less genetically equivalent to our species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.
C. siamense and C. theobromicola, two species exhibiting strong within-species phylogenetic structure, are 99.4% and 99.6% similar, respectively. This suggests that the species recognized within the C. gloeosporioides complex are recently evolved, a notion supported by Silva et al. (2012b). Their hypothesis regarding the recent evolution of host-specialized Colletotrichum populations from more generalist fungi was also referenced in relation to the C. acutatum complex by Lardner et al. (1999), utilizing the “episodic selection” framework proposed by Brasier (1995).
Several species we recognize contain isolates with divergent lifestyles, such as C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, C. kahawae, and C. theobromicola. Each of these species includes isolates capable of causing specific diseases. In the case of C. kahawae, recent pathogenicity tests have shown that only some isolates can cause coffee berry disease (Silva et al. 2012a; Silva & Weir, unpubl. data). These isolates can be distinguished using GS sequences (this study), Apn25L, and MAT1-2-1 (Silva et al. 2012b). Due to the well-understood pathogenicity of isolates within C. kahawae, the biosecurity importance of coffee berry disease, and the ability to distinguish disease-causing isolates using carefully selected genetic markers, we recognize these isolates taxonomically at the subspecific level. Future studies on the comparative pathogenicity of isolates within C. aotearoa, C. clidemiae, and C. theobromicola may reveal genetically distinct, host-specialized pathogenic populations within these species that future researchers may also choose to recognize taxonomically.
The classification we adopt here is deliberately conservative, minimizing nomenclatural changes. This reflects ongoing uncertainty about reasonable species limits within the C. gloeosporioides complex, which relate to low levels of genetic divergence across the complex, gene selection, isolate selection, and a lack of understanding of the mechanisms driving species and population divergence among these fungi. For instance, the two haplotype subgroups of C. fructicola are not distinguished taxonomically because they collectively form a monophyletic clade, and both subgroups include sets of isolates with similar geographic and host diversity. There is also no practical need to distinguish them taxonomically.
Molecular tools are increasingly being utilized for day-to-day identification by biosecurity officers and plant pathology researchers, highlighting the need for a taxonomy that accurately reflects genetically resolved groups, along with simple and reliable protocols for identifying those taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable. Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti, and some others.
Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.
Many of the species recognized in this work remain poorly understood in terms of their pathogenicity and host preference. This is partly due to a lack of certainty about the biological relationships between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.
In some cases, the apparent differences in pathogenicity among isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex are not reflected in their genetic characteristics.
Table 4 details the performance of individual genes in resolving species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. The results are categorized as follows: "Y" indicates species distinguished from all others, "N" indicates species not distinguished from all others, and "N*" indicates distinctions made at the subspecies level.
The section on G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” was truncated, as the document was created in Evaluation Mode.
In comparing our data with gene sequences reported as C. gloeosporioides in recent literature, most can be confidently placed within one of the species we accept. However, there are exceptions, such as the pecan-associated isolates from Liu et al. (2011) and the pistachio-associated isolates reported by Yang et al. (2011), both of which appear to represent undescribed species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Clearly, more species remain to be described within this complex. Additionally, there are taxonomic issues that need resolution, including the relationship between G. cingulata “f. sp. camelliae” and C. camelliae, the identity of cotton pathogens referred to as C. gossypii, the identity of cassava pathogens referred to as C. manihotis, the relationship between C. aeschynomenes and C. gloeosporioides “f. sp. jussiaeae”, the potential that various yam diseases discussed in the literature are all caused by C. alatae, and whether isolates of C. aotearoa from Meryta leaf spots form a biologically distinct population. A broader question involves understanding the frequency of hybrids within the C. gloeosporioides complex and the implications for interpreting phylogenies within this group. The impact of hybridization on the evolution of disease-specialized populations has been minimally explored.
