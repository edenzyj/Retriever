For the past two decades, the causal agent of anthracnose affecting strawberries in Korea was believed to be Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, recent molecular analyses have indicated that the genus Colletotrichum has undergone significant taxonomic revisions, introducing several new species. Consequently, it has been revealed that C. gloeosporioides comprises more than 20 distinct species. Therefore, the Korean pathogen isolated from strawberries needs reclassification. The shape and size of the conidia of the pathogen were not significantly different from those of C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola, but they did differ in the shape of the appressoria. A combined sequence analysis of partial actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, and the internal transcribed spacer regions indicated that the strawberry isolates formed a monophyletic group with authentic strains of C. fructicola. Based on these results, the anthracnose fungi associated with domestic strawberries in Korea were identified as C. fructicola, distinguishing them from C. gloeosporioides.
Anthracnose crown rot, to which all currently cultivated strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) varieties are susceptible, represents a major disease affecting over 30% of nurseries and the post-transplanting stage in Korea (Nam et al., 2009). The causal pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, was first reported by Kim et al. (1992).
C. gloeosporioides occurs in many crops and is a species aggregate that includes several polymorphic subgroups exhibiting varying degrees of pathogenicity, host specificity, and genetic homogeneity (Hyde et al., 2009a). The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides has facilitated accurate classification through comparative analysis.
Therefore, C. gloeosporioides, previously reported as a pathogen on strawberries in Korea, needs to be re-evaluated, considering the changed species boundaries and recent phylogenetic results within the genus Colletotrichum.
Isolation and Culture of Strains: Eleven strains were isolated from strawberry plants collected between 2005 and 2011. Diseased petiole, root, and crown tissues were surface sterilized by dipping in 2% NaOCl for 2 minutes, rinsed three times with sterile water, and dried on sterile tissue paper. The samples were then placed on water agar and incubated at 27°C. The growing edges of any fungal hyphae developing from the tissues were transferred aseptically to potato dextrose agar (PDA; Difco, Detroit, MI, USA). Single spore isolations were also performed using the procedures described by Prihastuti et al. (2009). Pure cultures were stored at 4°C on PDA slants.
Pathogenicity Test: Each isolated pathogen was prepared at a concentration of 1 × 10^5 conidia/mL, and 1 mL was sprayed per plant on the Seolhyang cultivar of strawberry plants. Six plants per isolate were used for testing. The inoculated plants were incubated in a dew chamber at 27°C and 100% relative humidity (RH) for 2 days before being moved to a plastic house maintained between 24°C and 30°C. After 60 days, the disease index of each plant was rated on a scale of 0 to 4: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% of petioles affected; 2, > 50% of petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on the entire plant (Nam et al., 2006). The disease index data from isolates were analyzed for means and standard error using the Costat program (CoHort Software, Berkeley, CA). All isolates caused anthracnose symptoms on the Seolhyang strawberry cultivar. The disease index for the isolates was highest (DI > 3) for CGF071204, CGF100713, and CGF110101. Smith and Black (1990) showed that the pathogenicity of C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae can be differentiated by factors such as strawberry tissue and cultivars. C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were reported to have a wide host range, while C. fragariae was restricted to strawberry plants (Freeman et al., 1998; Hyde et al., 2009b). Colletotrichum isolated from strawberries in Korea and Japan was pathogenic to both strawberry and apple fruit (Nam et al., 1998), as well as to avocado, broad bean, common sowthistle, cyclamen, pea, and strawberry under non-wound inoculation conditions (Okayama and Tsujimoto, 1994).
Morphological and Cultural Characteristics: The isolates were measured for colony characteristics, including shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as growth rate.
Table Description: The table presents the morphological characteristics of various Colletotrichum species isolated from strawberries. It includes detailed measurements for conidia and appressoria, such as lengths, widths, and shapes. Specifically, the conidia exhibit lengths ranging from 14.6 µm to 0.47 µm and widths from 3.99 µm to 0.11 µm, with cylindrical shapes noted. Appressoria dimensions are also provided, indicating varied shapes, including ovoid and sometimes clavate. Additionally, the growth rate of the species is recorded in mm per day, illustrating their colony characteristics that range from white to grey, and ultimately dark grey at the center, reflecting changes during growth.
The conidia of C. fructicola were observed after seven days of incubation on PDA media. The colony diameters were measured daily for seven days, allowing for the calculation of the average mean daily growth rate (in mm per day). The colors of the conidial masses and zonation were recorded at the end of the incubation period. Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, where a conidial suspension was placed in a hole on a glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The slide was then placed in an empty Petri dish containing wet filter paper and incubated at 28°C for two to four days.
Initially, colonies of the isolates on PDA appeared white and then developed a grey to dark grey color at the center over time, showing a growth rate of 9.98 ± 1.8 mm per day. The shape and size of the conidia were cylindrical, measuring 14.6 ± 0.47 × 3.99 ± 0.11 µm. The appressoria were ovoid, sometimes clavate, with measurements of 9.93 ± 0.32 × 4.90 ± 0.10 µm. Prihastuti et al. (2009) noted that the colony characteristics and conidial shape and size of C. fructicola were similar to those of C. gloeosporioides, although the appressoria of C. fructicola were ovoid and sometimes clavate.
Isolate Name: Various synonyms of C. fructicola and other related species are listed, such as C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, and C. siamense.
GenBank Accession Number: Each isolate is associated with a specific GenBank accession number, which allows for easy reference and identification in genetic databases.

The sequences of eleven strains from strawberry, along with the ex-type or authentic strains of anthracnose available from GenBank (refer to Table 3), were used in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method described by Park et al. (2005). For the amplification of the ITS, partial actin (ACT), and GAPDH genes, three different primer sets were employed: ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990); ACT512F and ACT783R (Prihastuti et al., 2009); and GDF1 and GDR1 (Peres et al., 2008). Amplification was performed using Maxime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PreMix (I-Taq, iNtRoN BioTechnology, Korea) in a final volume of 20 µl, containing 10 pmol of each primer set. PCR conditions were conducted as described by Prihastuti et al. (2009). PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified using a PCR quick-spin product purification kit (iNtRON BioTechnology, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences were determined by Bioneer Corporation (Chungwon, Korea). The sequences were proofread, edited, and merged with comparable sequences using the PHYDIT program version 3.2 (Chun, 1995). To determine the phylogenetic positions of the Colletotrichum isolates, the alignments of the three gene sequences of 11 Korean isolates and 34 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank were performed with Clustal 1.81 (Thompson et al., 1997). Nucleotide sequences were aligned manually where necessary. A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in MEGA v. 5.05, using TN93+I, which was selected as the most suitable nucleotide model by Modeltest (Tamura et al., 2011). Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1,000 replications to assess branch stability. Sequences of the ITS, ACT, and GAPDH regions of three isolates (CGF080901, CGF090501, and CGF100713) were deposited in GenBank (JX125050, JX125051, and JX125052; KC283023, KC283024, and KC283025; KC283017, KC283018, and KC283019, respectively).
PCR amplification of the ITS region generated 466 bp fragments for all isolates from strawberry plants. Sequence analysis of the ITS region revealed no sequence differences among all isolates and the authentic strains of C. fructicola (ICMP 18581, ICMP 18646, and ICMP 17921) (data not shown).
PCR amplification of the ACT gene produced 217-226 bp fragments for all isolates from strawberry plants. The Korean isolates presented two haplotypes (K1 and K2) (refer to Table 1). The ACT sequence of K1 (CGF050604 and CGF060617) differed from those of the other nine Korean isolates (K2) by three nucleotide polymorphic characters at positions 14, 96, and 129, along with a seven-nucleotide deletion from positions 23 to 29 (refer to Table 4). The ACT sequence of K1 is identical to that of C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921 (syn. Glomerella cingulata var. minor), whereas K2 displayed a sequence similarity of 99.4% with C. fructicola ICMP 18646 (syn. C. ignotum).
PCR amplification of the GAPDH genes yielded 232 bp fragments for all isolates. K1 differed from the other Korean isolates (K2) by three nucleotide polymorphic characters at positions 47, 57, and 117 (refer to Table 4). The GAPDH sequence of K1 showed a sequence similarity of 99.5% with that of C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921, while K2 exhibited a sequence similarity of 99.1% with C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and ICMP 18646.
The combined analysis indicated that the 11 strains isolated from Korea formed a monophyletic group with the authentic strains of C. fructicola (ICMP 18581, ICMP 18646, and ICMP 17921), clearly distinct from the other C. gloeosporioides complex (refer to Fig. 1). All isolates were classified into two subgroups: one subgroup (K1) comprised two Korean isolates and C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921, with a bootstrap value of 77%. The other subgroup (K2) included nine Korean isolates, along with C. fructicola ICMP 18581 and ICMP 18646, with a bootstrap value of 63%.
The table presents polymorphisms observed in the ACT and GAPDH genes for two haplotypes, K1 and K2, derived from Korean isolates. The haplotype K1 shows a sequence of nucleotide variations: T at positions 14, 23, 96, 129; and the presence of G, A, and C at other designated positions. In contrast, haplotype K2 has a distinct sequence, characterized by C's at positions 14, 23, 24, and 57, along with G, C, A, C, G, C, G at the subsequent positions.
Figure 1 illustrates the maximum-likelihood tree constructed from a combined dataset of ACT, GAPDH, and ITS sequences, highlighting the phylogenetic relationships among Colletotrichum species from strawberry plants in Korea and representative species of the C. gloeosporioides complex. Bootstrap values above each branch indicate the robustness of the relationships, derived from 1,000 replications, while the bar reflects the number of nucleotide substitutions.
In terms of phylogenetic analysis, K1 was found to be more closely related to the C. fructicola strain ICMP 17921 (synonymous with G. cingulata var. minor) from Ficus than K2, which grouped with C. fructicola strains ICMP 18581 and ICMP 18646 (syn. C. ignotum).
The Colletotrichum species identified globally from strawberries include C. gloeosporioides (Gunnell and Gubler, 1992), C. fragariae (Smith et al., 1990), C. acutatum (Smith et al., 1986), C. dematium (Beraha and Wright, 1973), and Gloeosporium spp. (Wright et al., 1960). In Korea, they are classified as C. gloeosporioides (perfect stage: G. cingulata) (Kim et al., 1992; Nam et al., 1998). Three anthracnose strains (KACC 40695, KACC 40696, and KACC 40812) stored in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC) were identified as C. gloeosporioides based on ITS and partial β-tubulin gene sequence analysis, as well as cultural characteristics (Kim et al., 2006).
In ITS analysis, strains KACC 40695 and KACC 40812 formed a monophyletic group with K2, showing 100% sequence similarity. Meanwhile, KACC 40696 was closely related to C. aenigma strain ICMP 18608, C. alienum strain ICMP 12071, and C. siamense ICMP 18578 (syn. C. hymenocallidis), and it differed from the ex-types of C. fructicola (data not shown). Comparative analysis of these three KACC strains using ITS sequences in this study suggests that further phylogenetic analysis using combined gene sequences is essential for accurate identification.
C. fragariae, originally reported as a strawberry disease in Florida, USA (Brooks, 1931), has been placed in synonymy with C. theobromicola (Weir et al., 2012). All isolates from Korea were clearly distinguished from C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) based on morphological and molecular phylogenetic analyses.
In conclusion, this study identified the anthracnose fungi affecting domestic strawberries as C. fructicola, distinguishing it from C. gloeosporioides based on their morphological and molecular phylogenetic features.
