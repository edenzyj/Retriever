Mango (Mangifera indica) is widely grown across southern China, particularly in the provinces of Guangxi, Hainan, Yunnan, Sichuan, and Taiwan. Guangxi has over 86,667 hectares dedicated to mango production. This study aimed to identify Colletotrichum species associated with mango in various parts of Guangxi and to examine their pathogenicity on mango leaves and fruits in vitro. Diseased leaves were collected from 25 mango orchards across different regions of Guangxi province. A total of 65 isolates were obtained from mango leaves showing anthracnose symptoms, which were further characterized based on morphological traits and DNA sequencing. Twenty-nine isolates from various locations were selected for sequencing and analysis of the internal transcribed spacer region, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and partial actin.
Mango (Mangifera indica) is regarded as one of the most significant tropical or subtropical fruit crops (Nelson 2008). In China, it is primarily cultivated in the southern and southwestern provinces, with a planted area of nearly 130,000 hectares, yielding approximately 900,000 tons in 2012 (Li et al. 2013). Guangxi province is the largest mango-producing area in China, significantly contributing to the local economy (Li et al. 2013). Anthracnose, caused by several Colletotrichum species, is recognized as the most critical disease affecting mango in China (Hong et al. 2016). While Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is the primary causal agent, Colletotrichum acutatum has also been reported (Freeman et al. 1998; Jayasinghe and Fernando 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Symptoms of mango anthracnose include irregularly shaped, black necrotic spots on both the upper and lower sides of mango leaves, with lesions also appearing on stalks and flowers. The most significant damage occurs during ripening and postharvest stages, when black lesions develop on mango fruit surfaces (Arauz 2000; Freeman et al. 1998).
Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.

The same specimen, when grown in the lab under different growth conditions, highlights the need for molecular techniques to separate species of Colletotrichum and to examine genetic variation within and between species and populations (Cai et al. 2009; Hyde et al. 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Recent studies on the systematics of Colletotrichum species have categorized them into nine major clades, along with small clusters and isolated species, which may represent species complexes (Cannon et al. 2012).
The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA has frequently been used to differentiate Colletotrichum species (Freeman et al. 2000), though it has not always been satisfactory (Cannon et al. 2012). Other markers, such as actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), have also been utilized to resolve relationships among Colletotrichum species (Weir et al. 2012). Given the recent changes in the classification of Colletotrichum species and the limited information on the identity and characteristics of isolates causing mango anthracnose in China, the objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to identify and characterize species of Colletotrichum associated with mango anthracnose in Guangxi, China, based on morphology and DNA sequence comparisons; (ii) to examine the virulence of isolates from different parts of Guangxi province and assess whether there are geographical differences; and (iii) to investigate relationships among Colletotrichum spp. from mango using sequences of ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and GAPDH.
Fungal Isolation: Mango leaves exhibiting symptoms of anthracnose were collected from production fields across six counties (Tiandong, Tianyang, Tianlin, Youjiang, Wuming, and Qinzhou) in Guangxi province, covering an area of 450 by 300 km. Small (3 × 3 mm) sections were cut from lesion margins and surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 15 seconds and 0.1% (v/v) mercuric chloride for 45 seconds, followed by rinsing in sterile water. The sections were then plated onto potato dextrose agar (PDA) and incubated at 25 °C. Fungal growth was monitored daily for up to 14 days. Isolates were subcultured onto fresh PDA and purified through single-spore culture. They were subsequently stored on PDA slants at 4 °C.
Morphological Characterization: Isolates were cultured on PDA plates at 25 °C under continuous fluorescent light for 5 days. Plugs (6 mm in diameter) from colony margins were placed in the center of each 90-mm-diameter plate, with four replications. Colony color and culture diameters (measured in two perpendicular directions) were recorded after 3, 7, and 10 days at 25 °C. These diameters were used to calculate the hyphal growth rate (mm/day). Isolates were incubated at 25 °C for 21 days on PDA plates to assess conidial production, as well as the shape and size of conidia. The length and width of 150 conidia per isolate were measured.
DNA Isolation, PCR, and Sequencing: Isolates were cultured on PDA in Petri plates overlaid with cellophane for 7 days at 25 °C. Mycelia were harvested with a flamed spatula, and genomic DNA was extracted using the cetyltrimethyl ammonium bromide method (Taylor et al. 1993). All strains in this study were analyzed for the rDNA-ITS, partial GAPDH, partial ACT, partial TUB2, and partial CHS-1 genomic regions. PCR amplification of GAPDH was performed using primers GDF1 and GDR1 (Templeton et al. 1992), while CHS-1 was amplified with CHS79F and CHS354R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). The partial ACT, TUB2, and ITS regions were amplified using primer pairs ACT512F and ACT783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), T1 and Bt2b (Glass and Donaldson 1995), and ITS1 and ITS4 (White et al. 1990), respectively. All PCR reactions were conducted in 50 µl volumes containing 1× PCR buffer, 0.2 mM concentrations of each dNTP, 4 mM MgCl2, and 0.5 mM concentrations of each primer.
Table 1 Description: Table 1 lists the primers used for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing in the study. It includes specific sequences for various regions such as rDNA-ITS, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, and CHS-1. Each primer is paired with a reference for its source or initial publication, providing clarity on their origin and application in the context of the research.
ITS = rDNA internal transcribed spacer region.
This table lists various species of Colletotrichum isolates, along with their associated culture collections and GenBank accession numbers for different genetic markers. The markers include ITS (rDNA internal transcribed spacer region), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), ACT (actin gene), CHS-1 (chitin synthase), and TUB2 (β-tubulin). The table details specific isolates from various hosts and countries, showcasing a diverse range of plant associations. For instance, C. asianum is noted for being found on Mangifera indica in Australia, while C. gloeosporioides is associated with Citrus sinensis in Italy. Each entry includes a unique identifier from culture collections such as IMI (CABI Europe UK Centre), ICMP (International Collection of Microorganisms from Plant), CBS (CBS-KNAW Fungal Biodiversity Centre), and others, indicating the geographic and taxonomic diversity among these isolates.

Sequences were edited and assembled using DNAMAN (version 5.2.2; Lynnon Biosoft) to produce consensus sequences that were compared by BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) against the NCBI non-redundant database. Sequences from extype or ex-epitype isolates of Colletotrichum species from GenBank were selected for use in the phylogenetic analyses. Sequence alignments of each gene and combined genes were made with ClustalX version 1.83. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA4 software version 4.0 using the maximum parsimony method.
Selected isolates were used for pathogenicity and virulence tests on detached fruits and leaves of mango (cultivar Tainong) under controlled conditions. Isolates were incubated on PDA plates for 7 to 10 days at 25 °C in the laboratory. Fresh young leaves and freshly harvested mango fruits without visible disease from Tiandong, Guangxi, were used for inoculation. The leaves and mango fruits were washed with running water, surface sterilized in 70% ethanol for 30 seconds and 1% NaClO for 1 minute, and finally rinsed with sterile distilled water.
After air drying, detached young healthy leaves (12 to 15 cm) were placed into plastic containers (252 × 174 × 93 mm) lined with moist absorbent paper, and six stab wounds were made in the mid-region forming a circle with a 5 mm diameter using a sterilized needle. Hyphal plugs from actively growing margins of PDA cultures were placed on each wound spot on the leaves. The experiment was completely randomized with three replicates per isolate, involving five leaves per replicate. Fifteen leaves were inoculated for each isolate, while controls received sterile agar plugs. The containers were partially sealed in plastic and incubated at 25 °C in the dark in a growth chamber. Virulence was assessed by measuring lesion length at 7 days post-inoculation (DPI) in two perpendicular directions on each leaf.
After washing and air drying, nearly ripened mango fruits (~200 g) were wounded in the protruding fleshy parts by stabbing with a flamed needle to a depth of 3 mm, again forming a circle with a 5 mm diameter. Mycelial plugs of 6 mm diameter from PDA cultures were placed on the wound sites, while control treatments used sterile agar plugs. Inoculated fruits were placed in plastic containers (252 × 174 × 93 mm) overlaid with moist absorbent paper to maintain humidity. The containers were placed in unsealed bags and incubated at 25 °C in the dark. Fruits were checked for the development of symptoms for up to 10 days. Isolates were considered pathogenic when lesions expanded beyond the initial 5 mm diameter wound site. Virulence was evaluated by measuring lesion length at 10 DPI in two perpendicular directions. Significant differences in virulence were assessed by analysis of variance, and when significant treatment effects were found, means were compared by LSD (P = 0.05) using Data Processing System software (DPS 3.0) for Windows (Zhejiang University, Hangzhou, China).
From 2011 to 2014, leaves of mango with anthracnose symptoms were collected from 25 mango orchards in Guangxi province, China. At least one isolate from each field was chosen for further analysis. In total, 65 Colletotrichum isolates were obtained from different areas of Guangxi, and 29 single-spore isolates were used for further study.
Table 3 lists the mango isolates of Colletotrichum species collected from Guangxi, along with their respective GenBank accession numbers for several genomic regions. The table includes columns for the isolate, species, geographic area, and accession numbers corresponding to various genes, including ACT (actin gene), TUB2 (β-tubulin), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), CHS-1 (chitin synthase), and ITS (rDNA internal transcribed spacer). This information is crucial for understanding the genetic diversity and phylogenetic relationships among the Colletotrichum isolates studied.
A total of 100 isolates were used for further study (see Table 3). These included one isolate from each orchard, though in larger orchards, more than one isolate was chosen for analysis. Among the 29 selected isolates, 15 were identified as C. asianum, 11 as C. fructicola, and 3 as C. siamense, using both morphological and molecular methods. Additional species isolated, such as those from the genera Alternaria, Phomopsis, Botryosphaeria, and Pestalotia, were not considered for further investigation. BLASTn searches against GenBank for the DNA sequences generated from 15 isolates showed high similarity (>99%) with C. asianum. Eleven isolates exhibited high similarity with C. fructicola, while 3 isolates had a similarity of 99-100% with C. siamense sequences.
Figure 1 illustrates the phylogenetic tree constructed using sequences from 29 Colletotrichum isolates sourced from mango trees in Guangxi, alongside extype or ex-epitype isolates from GenBank. The tree was based on combined sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), beta-tubulin (TUB2), and chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1) genes. Bootstrap values greater than 50% (from 1,000 replications) are indicated at the nodes, with Colletotrichum acutatum serving as the outgroup. The isolates from this study are highlighted in bold.
Sequences of ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS from the Colletotrichum isolates collected from mango trees in Guangxi province were submitted to GenBank (as shown in Table 3) and aligned with sequences of Colletotrichum species from various hosts and countries (detailed in Table 2). The gene boundaries for the alignment were as follows: ACT (282 to 289 bp), TUB2 (699 to 701 bp), CHS-1 (299 bp), GAPDH (277 to 280 bp), and ITS (546 bp).
The phylogenetic analysis of the 29 Colletotrichum isolates from this study, combined with sequences from extype or ex-epitype isolates in GenBank, was performed using maximum parsimony analysis on the combined ITS, ACT, GAPDH, TUB2, and CHS-1 genes. The dataset revealed three well-separated clades. A highly supported clade (99% bootstrap support) included fifteen Colletotrichum isolates alongside C. asianum isolates ICMP18580 from Coffea arabica in Thailand and IMI313839 from Mangifera indica in Australia. A separate clade (69% bootstrap support) was composed of eleven isolates associated with C. fructicola, including isolates ICMP18727, ICMP18613, and ICMP12568.
The diversity analyses of 29 isolates of Colletotrichum species revealed the following distribution: 15 isolates (51.7%) belonged to C. asianum, 11 isolates (37.9%) to C. fructicola, and 3 isolates (10.2%) to C. siamense.
Morphological and Cultural Characterization: All tested isolates developed white colonies that turned gray to black after 14 days on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar). Colony sectoring was observed in 8 of the 29 isolates. There was considerable variation in the mycelial growth rate among the 29 isolates of Colletotrichum. The average mycelial growth rate for C. asianum was 6.7 to 10.7 mm/day, for C. fructicola, 7.3 to 12.4 mm/day, and for C. siamense, 9.4 to 11.1 mm/day. The conidia were all hyaline, guttulate, one-celled, and cylindrical.
Figure 2 illustrates the morphological characteristics of colonies and conidia of mango Colletotrichum isolates from Guangxi. It includes images of the upper and reverse sides of the C. asianum NN8 PDA plate at 14 days post-inoculation, along with images of the conidia. Similar images are provided for C. fructicola isolate WM01-2 and C. siamense isolate TY9, each also displaying the upper and reverse sides of their cultures after 14 days. The bar in the images measures 10 mm.
The average conidial sizes for the isolates were: for C. asianum, 12.1 to 18.6 µm by 4.2 to 5.6 µm; for C. fructicola, 14.1 to 20.2 µm by 3.7 to 4.3 µm; and for C. siamense, 15.0 to 18.5 µm by 5.0 to 5.5 µm. The various Colletotrichum species reported here displayed differences in conidial size and growth rates.
Pathogenicity and Virulence in Tissues: All 29 tested isolates were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits. Ripened fruits with anthracnose developed sunken, dark brown to black decay. The virulence of the 29 isolates of Colletotrichum from Guangxi province showed significant differences, with lesion diameters ranging from 7.0 to 30.0 mm on leaves and from 6 to 21 mm on fruits. The lesion diameter of C. asianum on leaves ranged from 9.2 to 28.2 mm and on fruits ranged from 6.2 to 21 mm. For C. fructicola, it was 8.8 to 30.0 mm on leaves and 5.8 to 13.6 mm on fruits. For C. siamense, the range was 7.0 to 22.2 mm on leaves and 6.0 to 6.5 mm on fruits. The virulence of C. fructicola isolates TD1 and TD4 from the same field showed significant differences (P ≤ 0.05).
This is the first report characterizing Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of mango in Guangxi province, China, using morphological identification and phylogenetic analysis. The morphological features of the isolates corresponded to the description of C. gloeosporioides. However, cultural characteristics, which may vary due to cultural conditions, and conidial morphology cannot distinguish between species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Based on morphological identification, single gene sequence analysis, and five-gene combined phylogenetic analysis, the isolates obtained from mango in Guangxi belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex. C. gloeosporioides has been previously identified as the causal agent of tropical fruit rots, including mango, and the present study confirmed that all 29 isolates from mango leaves with anthracnose symptoms across a 450 by 300 km region belong to this species complex. In contrast, Phoulivong et al. (2010) reported that C. gloeosporioides was not a common pathogen in the tropics and was not responsible for mango anthracnose in Thailand or Laos.
C. asianum was distinctly separated using a five-gene combined phylogenetic analysis in this study, and it was the predominant species associated with mangoes in Guangxi, South China. This finding is in agreement with Vieira et al. (2014), who reported that C. asianum was the most common endophytic species found in mango trees. C. asianum is a well-known pathogen of mangoes in India, Australia, Panama, and Thailand (Sharma et al. 2015).
Table 4 presents the morphological and virulence descriptions of Colletotrichum isolates from mango trees in Guangxi, China. The table includes various metrics such as conidial size, mycelial growth rate, and lesion diameter on mango leaves and fruits. Measurements of conidial size (in micrometers) reveal a range from approximately 12.1 to 20.2 mm, while mycelial growth rates (in mm/day) range from 3.7 to 6.5 mm. The lesion diameter on mango leaves shows variability, with measurements ranging from 3.7 to 6.5 mm, and on mango fruit, the diameter ranges from 4.0 to 5.8 mm. The data were collected under controlled conditions after 21 days, with details on measurement methods included in the table notes.
C. fructicola displays significant morphological and geographical diversity. It has been found on various hosts, including coffee berries in Thailand and Pyrus pyrifolia in Japan, among others. Although C. fructicola has been reported in association with mangoes in Brazil and Korea (Joa et al. 2016), this is the first report of its infection in mangoes in China. The species C. ignotum is synonymous with C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), and our genetic analyses indicated that the isolates from these two species grouped into one clade with two subgroups.
C. siamense has been associated with mango anthracnose in Colombia (Pardo-De la Hoz et al. 2016) and found on mango fruit in Sanya, Hainan Province, China (Qin et al. 2017). However, this species is not common in Guangxi province, where only three isolates were identified as C. siamense. In this study, C. siamense was not well differentiated from the C. gloeosporioides complex using the combined five-gene analysis, suggesting that additional genetic markers may be necessary for clearer separation in future studies.
Pathogenicity tests conducted using three species of Colletotrichum isolates demonstrated that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits during wound-inoculation studies. The symptoms exhibited varied significantly based on factors such as fruit variety, environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), and inoculum concentration (Freeman et al. 1998). Consequently, the findings of this study may not fully capture the virulence potential of these species. Further research is recommended to explore the virulence of Colletotrichum species under field conditions with natural inoculum, rather than relying solely on in vitro artificial inoculation.
