Coffee berry disease (CBD) is caused by Colletotrichum kahawae, affecting only green berries and leading to cherry rot and premature fruit drop, resulting in significant harvest losses in the western highlands of Cameroon. The study investigated the origin of primary inoculum and the onset of epidemics. Weekly monitoring occurred in uniform plots of coffee trees at two locations: Santa (1,750 m) in 2003-2004 and Bafou (1,820 m) in 2004-2005. A logistic model effectively described the temporal dynamics of the epidemic. Spatial distribution analyses indicated stepwise contamination of plots from the initially infected trees. Semi-variogram analysis and disease dispersal maps created via kriging revealed primary infection foci at both sites, observed from weeks 8 to 10 post-flowering in Bafou and from weeks 11 to 13 in Santa. CBD affected entire plots three weeks after the initial foci appeared, suggesting that inoculum from prior epidemics persists at points in the initial foci within a coffee plantation.
The parasitic activity of the pathogen begins by infecting young fruit at the “pin head” stage, approximately 4 to 6 weeks post-flowering. The first symptoms are typically detected on fruits that are 8 to 10 weeks old, appearing as dark, sunken lesions that can expand and coalesce, potentially affecting the entire fruit. Some infected berries may remain attached to the branches, serving as a secondary source of inoculum. Several cycles of pathogen development can occur up to the 25th week of fruit development, when the berries develop ontogenic resistance, coinciding with the onset of fruit endocarp hardening. The severity of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) is highly dependent on climatic factors, particularly temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Rain is essential for the dispersal of conidia of Colletotrichum spp. Optimal temperatures for conidium germination and mycelial growth of C. kahawae on coffee are between 20 to 22°C. Appressorium formation occurs at these temperatures with relative humidity approaching 100%. Climatic conditions conducive to C. kahawae typically occur at high elevations (above 1,600 m), while disease incidence is minimal below 1,000 m. Agricultural practices may also influence disease severity. Currently, CBD is managed through host resistance, cultural practices, and chemical control. However, these management strategies could be implemented more efficiently as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy, which producers of Arabica coffee could adopt. This approach requires prior knowledge of the host-parasite-environment interactions that govern disease development.
To gain a clearer understanding of how epidemics develop in high-altitude regions with significant disease pressure, we conducted spatio-temporal monitoring of the disease. The study was undertaken at two sites with contrasting agro-ecological conditions: Bafou (05°33.540N, 10°04.520E, 1,820 m elevation) and Santa (05°47.190N, 10°09.672E, 1,750 m elevation). At each site, we selected a uniform plot cultivated without shade or intercrops. Each plot measured approximately 1,000 m², containing 58 coffee trees at Santa and 67 at Bafou. Each tree was spatially identified by its coordinates and a unique identification number. The coffee trees at Santa were about 50 years old and pruned to an umbrella type architecture, while those at Bafou were around 20 years old, featuring a single stem pruned to a pyramid shape. Both locations utilized the Jamaica cultivar, known for its high susceptibility to CBD. The coffee trees were spaced 3 × 2.5 m apart and were maintained by pruning to remove dead branches, suckers, and mummified berries. They were fertilized after each fruit set with mineral fertilizer (N-P-K: 20-10-10, ADER-Cameroon) at a rate of 200 g per plant. Two annual applications of glyphosate (Round-Up; Monsanto) at 2.4 liters/ha were utilized for weed control. This study was conducted on the same trees over two consecutive years: from 2003 to 2004 at Santa and from 2004 to 2005 at Bafou.
Pdis = (Ndbn / TotB1) × 100, where Ndbn represents the sum of diseased new berries from the first to the nth observation, and TotB1 is the total number of berries counted during the first observation. Daily rainfall was recorded throughout the entire experimental period at each site, which was used to compute weekly cumulative rainfall.
Statistical Analyses: The general linear model (GLM) was employed to conduct an analysis of variance to determine the effect of berry position on the trees (upper, middle, and lower sections) regarding the percentage of diseased berries at the end of each year. Each coffee tree was treated as an experimental unit, with the number of replicates corresponding to the number of individuals in the plot (58 at Santa and 67 at Bafou). All data underwent arcsine √x transformation to normalize the variance. Descriptive maps illustrating the spatial distribution of the disease were also produced from the cumulative percentages of diseased berries over time.
where B = (K – Y₀) / Y₀, with Y₀ being the initial disease level (20). The duration of the exponential period and the maximum rate of disease spread were determined using formulas derived from cocoa pod growth modeling by Berry and Cilas (5): Kr/4 for the maximum rate of disease spread and ln(B)/r for its exponential phase.

C. This value equals 1 for a variogram with no nugget variance (where the curve passes through the origin) and equals 0 when there is no spatially dependent variation at the specified range.
+C (the sill) is the model asymptote. Kriging analysis was employed to localize foci on the experimental plot. Kriging is a nearest-neighbor interpolation technique in which the estimated disease level at a given tree location is a weighted moving average of best estimates to minimize local area variance (Geostatistics for the Environmental Sciences). It serves as the best linear unbiased estimator based on prior selection of a variogram. Kriging can only be conducted for variograms that show spatial dependence between trees.
The analysis of variance and the descriptive maps of disease spatial distribution were conducted using SAS software (Version 9.0, SAS Institute Inc., Cary, NC). The analysis of nonlinear regressions was performed using CurveExpert software (D. Hyams, Starkville, MS, USA). Semi-variogram and kriging analyses were executed with GS+ (Gamma Design Software).
The incidence of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) varies depending on the branch position on the coffee tree. The total number of berries fluctuated each year, regardless of the site. In 2004, the average was relatively high, with 48 berries per branch at Bafou and 66 at Santa. The initial berry count was low in 2003 at Santa and in 2005 at Bafou. At Santa, the percentage of infected berries was estimated to be around 40% in each of the two study years. Conversely, at Bafou, CBD incidence varied significantly (P < 0.0001) from one year to the next, estimated at about 30% of diseased berries in 2004 and 20% in 2005. There were no differences between coffee tree branches at Santa; however, a significant interaction was observed between coffee tree branches and production years at Bafou. In 2004, the highest incidence occurred in the upper branches, while disease rates were consistent across all branches in 2005.
Temporal Dynamics: The best fits for temporal disease spread were achieved with the logistic and Morgan-Mercer-Flodin (MMF) models, both of which are part of the sigmoidal model family. The logistic model was the most appropriate for explaining temporal disease spread at both sites, although the 2004 data were well fitted by the MMF model at Santa. The infection spread rapidly between the 10th and 20th weeks after flowering, with the maximum rate of disease spread estimated to be higher and more stable at around 6% (diseased new berries per week) at Santa compared to around 4% in 2004 and 3% in 2005 at Bafou. The disease period at Santa was noted around the 20th week in 2003 and the 25th week in 2004. At Bafou, this occurred around the 20th week for both years.
Spatial Dynamics: The rainfall received during the epidemic's progression influenced the exponential disease spread. At the onset of the epidemic, symptoms were observed on trees that were either isolated or in small clusters. Semi-variogram analysis indicated an isotropic type of distribution.
However, it seems that important information is missing, such as the actual numbers and percentages. If you could provide more context or additional details, I would be happy to refine it further!
The lower branches of coffee trees, particularly those in the canopy, were more severely attacked by coffee berry disease (CBD) than those at Bafou. Research indicates that infections of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (now C. acutatum) develop along a descending gradient. It is likely that the impact of rainfall on C. kahawae infections was less effective on the berries of the lower branches due to a possible barrier effect from the branches in the canopy. Additionally, infection was more severe on the fruits of the upper branches rather than on the lower ones.
This highlights the need for a study on the coffee tree architecture's role in CBD development, to assess the disease's spatial distribution at the coffee tree scale and to determine the specific impact of rainfall on this distribution.
Table 3 presents the characteristics of coffee berry disease epidemics observed at both Santa and Bafou sites over several years. It includes parameters from a logistic model: the site, the parameter K, slope (B), the percentage of disease incidence (r), and the duration of the exponential period in weeks. For instance, during 2003, the Santa site exhibited a K value of 37.32, a slope of 4050.02, a disease incidence of 0.65%, and a duration of 6.03 weeks. In 2004, Bafou reported a K value of 29.22 with a slope of 1805.58, a disease incidence of 0.60%, and a duration of 4.35 weeks.
Figure 2 illustrates the weekly cumulative rainfall during the exponential progression period of coffee berry disease.
Table 2 summarizes the model functions that describe the temporal progression of coffee berry disease at both Santa (2003-2004) and Bafou (2004-2005). The models include sigmoid and polynomial functions, indicating high correlation coefficients (R² values) for each model, which demonstrates their effectiveness in modeling disease progression over the specified periods.
Figure 3 shows the spatial distribution of coffee trees affected by coffee berry disease during the 10th and 20th weeks after flowering at Santa. Bars in the figure indicate the cumulative percentage of infected berries, while the x- and y-axes represent the coordinates of each tree on the plot.
Table 4 provides characteristics of semi-variograms obtained at both Santa (2003 and 2004) and Bafou (2004 and 2005) for coffee berry disease, categorizing berries by age in weeks, specifically from 6 to 8 weeks, 9 to 10 weeks, and 11 weeks.
The infection level remained substantially the same over the two years. The model parameters (K, B, and r) varied depending on the site and year, confirming the hypothesis of a considerable influence of mostly random climatic parameters (rainfall, temperatures, wind, etc.) on the temporal spread of coffee berry disease (CBD). Various spatial analysis methods have been used by numerous authors to study the regionalization of diseases in plots. These methods vary depending on the pathosystems; however, they all aim to determine potential spatial correlations between plants within the plot. A study of semi-variograms using geostatistical analyses enabled us to identify CBD infection foci. Sache defined the focus as “the first point of inoculation characterized by a quantity of disease that is far greater than that seen on surrounding plants.” Such foci were identified at two sites in the first year of observations (2003 at Santa and 2004 at Bafou), appearing 1 to 2 weeks after the first symptoms and becoming blurred during the exponential phase of the disease, precisely at its maximum spread. In the second year of observations, infection foci were not seen at Santa, while at Bafou, they persisted from the start of the disease until the end of observations. These results reflect the non-permanent nature of CBD infection foci from one year to another in the study plots. In the case of diseases dispersed over large distances, such as rust diseases, foci may be due to inoculum from outside. For annual crop diseases, foci may survive from harvest residues contaminated by the pathogen. For diseases with limited dispersal, such as anthracnose on perennial crops, primary infection foci are typically not due to an allo-inoculum. Disease emergence is due to a primary inoculum conserved within the plot, either in the tissues of seemingly healthy organs or in dead tissues, such as leaves, branches, or mummified fruits. All the foci revealed by the semi-variograms were located in the plots using kriging. They may result from a heterogeneous distribution of the primary inoculum in the plot or arise after highly conducive microclimatic conditions in specific zones. Such microclimates may preferentially develop for several years in certain parts of plots, leading to recurrent appearances of infection foci in the same locations in coffee plantations, as observed over the two years at Bafou. After harvesting, when there are no longer any berries on the coffee trees, the pathogen survives as a saprophyte in unaffected tissues. At the beginning of the following season, those tissues are potential sources of auto-inoculation likely to cause new infections in each plant within the plots. The spread of the disease by foci appears to result from a combined effect, within a particular microclimate, of auto-inoculation of the plants and lateral dispersal of conidia.
Infections arising from pre-existing foci soon fade. In woody plants, the dissemination of diseases with low dispersal is quicker on a tree scale than within a plot. This has been observed in cases such as Monilinia fructigena infections on apples and Phytophthora megakarya infections on cocoa. The isotropy of the semi-variograms obtained in our study showed that coffee berry disease (CBD) infection foci do not follow a preferential direction within plots. This indicates the random nature of CBD dissemination, primarily driven by rainfall.
The spherical semi-variograms observed at Santa indicated that contamination occurred in a stepwise manner between coffee trees in the plot, which restricted the infection foci to a small number of plants. In contrast, the Gaussian-type semi-variograms mostly found at Bafou revealed some spatial correlations between coffee trees up to three units apart. This interval, corresponding to approximately 9 meters between the trees, indicated that the foci at Bafou spread to a larger number of individuals compared to those at Santa. Given the main foci observed in 2004 at Bafou, the spatial spread of the disease could be estimated at one unit per week, approximately 3 meters per week.
In conclusion, CBD infections begin from foci whose extent and regularity depend on factors that remain poorly understood. These foci appear 1 to 2 weeks after the onset of the disease and fade at the end of the exponential phase, shortly before the curve concavity changes. Our results suggest that studies on pathogen survival at these foci will provide valuable information for more effective disease control. Moreover, epidemic spread curves indicate that fruits should be protected from CBD before the eighth week after flowering. This study was funded by the European Union (Inco-Dev/CBD-Resist project).
