Three species of Colletotrichum—Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (teleomorph: Glomerella acutata J.C. Guerber & J.C. Correll), Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph: Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk)—are major pathogens of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa). Strawberry anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease in commercial strawberry fields in the southeastern United States since the 1930s. The causal fungus, C. fragariae, can infect all aboveground plant parts; however, the disease is most severe when it infects the crown, leading to crown rot, wilting, and plant death.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was responsible for an epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry nurseries in Arkansas and North Carolina in the late 1970s. The anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the United States in 1986. Since the 1980s, increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the United States may be linked to changes in cultivars and the widespread use of annual plasticulture production, as opposed to the traditional matted-row production system.
Investigations into anthracnose in the United States have focused on its epidemiology and the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species regarding their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics, infection processes, and pathogenicity. These studies have enhanced our understanding of the diseases and improved control measures. Strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels are more susceptible to anthracnose compared to those cultivated in soils with lower nitrogen levels or amended with calcium nitrate. The disease spreads more rapidly in fields with overhead irrigation and plastic mulch than in those utilizing drip irrigation and straw mulch.
Fungicide efficacy has been assessed through in vitro, greenhouse, and field studies, revealing some pathogen resistance to certain fungicides. Developing anthracnose-resistant cultivars remains a major objective of most strawberry breeding programs in the southern United States.
Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.
The primary pathogens include Colletotrichum fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides. Each of these species contributes to the severity and spread of anthracnose diseases, underscoring the need for ongoing research and management strategies.
The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is responsible for anthracnose crown rot, petiole lesions, and leaf spots that are indistinguishable from those caused by C. fragariae. In a series of comparative studies on these three major causal agents of strawberry anthracnose, Smith and Black (1990) examined the cultural characteristics, conidia, appressoria, and setae of 24 Colletotrichum isolates. Isolates of C. fragariae developed beige to olive to dark gray colonies and did not form the ascigerous state in culture. Their conidia were typically cylindrical, with one end sharply tapered and the other end rounded.
C. gloeosporioides isolates were very similar, except they formed the Glomerella cingulata ascigerous state in culture, and their conidia were usually rounded at both ends. Both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides produced dark black setae, which are visible with a hand lens, in acervuli in culture and on petiole, stolon, and fruit lesions. In contrast, C. acutatum isolates produced fusiform conidia that were tapered at both ends, developed colonies in white, pink, orange, rose, or beige, and did not form setae or the ascigerous state in culture. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture was slower than that of the other two species at all tested temperatures, with the most significant difference noted at 32°C.
Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).
In the late 1970s, C. gloeosporioides was identified as the causal agent on plants from Arkansas and North Carolina nurseries that exhibited a crown rot identical to that caused by C. fragariae (Howard et al., 1992). It has a wide host and geographic range, causing diseases in many plant hosts worldwide. The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries arise from fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruits and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002).
The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all regions where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often lead to stunted plants rather than plant death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and produce few berries at harvest.
Results from several studies suggest that Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. In one of these studies (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence of two subgroups within C. acutatum. The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberries and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses. Based on these molecular data, Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberries. Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).
Anthracnose crown rot (Smith, 1998a), caused by either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides, is first noticeable by the wilting of the youngest leaves during the hottest part of the day. The young wilted leaves may seem to recover and become turgid in the evenings; however, most will wilt and die after a few days. Shortly after the plants wilt, a red discoloration appears within the crown tissue, from which the causal pathogen may be isolated. After the plants have been dead for several days, the crown tissue will turn dark brown to black, making it difficult to isolate Colletotrichum spp. Colletotrichum acutatum may also cause crown death; however, it typically infects only a single side crown rather than the entire crown, leading to stunted but not dead plants.
All three Colletotrichum spp. can cause lesions on petioles and stolons, which are dark brown or black, sunken, and often girdle the petiole or stolon. Pink masses of conidia are usually visible near the center of each lesion. Each species also causes leaf spots (Howard et al., 1992; Maas and Palm, 1997; Smith, 1998c). Black leaf spot, typically caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides, is characterized by gray or light black spots, usually not necrotic, peppered across the top surface of the strawberry leaflets. C. acutatum more typically causes irregular leaf spots, primarily characterized by necrotic black lesions at the tips of the leaflets. All three Colletotrichum spp. also cause flower blights and fruit rots (Smith, 1998b). Fully open flowers are much more susceptible than closed buds (Smith, 1993). Infected green fruit are often hard and brown and mummify rather than ripen. Anthracnose lesions on ripe fruit are firm, slightly sunken, and covered with pink spore masses. Additionally, Colletotrichum acutatum also causes root lesions.
The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).
Because the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appeared to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised, after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s, to obtain their transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, which were believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. More recently, C. acutatum has been found in some nurseries in these areas. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants can be produced in the southeastern United States by locating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants remain the primary control method for anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.
Since Colletotrichum spp. may infect many other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields is sometimes assumed to come from these other hosts growing near the strawberry field. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable hosts to strawberries, 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts, were wound-inoculated onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith, 2002). Colletotrichum fragariae isolates...
Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.
Anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl₂ developed less fruit rot than that from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl₂ (Smith and Gupton, 1993). The primary means to reduce the buildup of anthracnose fruit rot in the field is to harvest fruit frequently and remove all rotten fruit. Following severe infections early in the fruiting season, all infected fruit should be stripped from the plants and removed from the field. Infected areas of a field should be harvested last in the day, or workers should wash up and change to clean clothes when entering uninfected areas of the field after harvesting areas with fruit rot present.
Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.
In-vitro trials have been used to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose (LaMondia, 1993; McInnes et al., 1992b; Smith and Black, 1992). Smith and Black (1993) reported that all 16 C. acutatum, 14 out of 18 C. fragariae, and both C. gloeosporioides isolates tested in vitro were resistant to benomyl, and all benomyl-resistant isolates were also resistant to carbendazim, which belongs to the same class of fungicides as benomyl. In a greenhouse study, plants treated with propiconazole exhibited lower disease severity ratings than those treated with captafol or benomyl (Smith and Black, 1991). However, the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter, with dark green leaves that appeared thicker than the leaves of untreated plants.
In the early 1980s, when anthracnose became a major disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States, the USDA-ARS initiated a breeding program aimed at developing anthracnose-resistant cultivars suitable for the region. This program was established at the Small Fruit Research Station in Poplarville, MS, and the Fruit Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, in collaboration with state experiment stations in Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina (Galletta et al., 1997; Smith and Spiers, 1982). From 1976 to 1995, over 160,000 progeny from 448 crosses made primarily by G.J. Galletta at Beltsville were screened for anthracnose resistance in the greenhouse at Poplarville, MS.
Initially, the parent lines consisted of eastern cultivars and advanced selections from the breeding program at Beltsville. As the program progressed, resistant selections from the anthracnose program were crossed with commercial cultivars to enhance the horticultural characteristics of the progeny. Seeds from the crosses made at Beltsville were germinated at Poplarville, where the resulting seedlings were inoculated with a conidial suspension of Colletotrichum fragariae, incubated in a dew chamber for 48 hours, then moved to a warm greenhouse and evaluated for anthracnose severity 30 days after inoculation.
Resistant seedlings were tested in the field across several states, including Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, and North Carolina. Selections were made based on yield, fruit quality, plant habit, and resistance to leaf scorch (caused by Diplocarpon earlianum), leaf spot (caused by Mycosphaerella fragariae), powdery mildew (caused by Sphaerotheca macularis), and two-spotted spider mites (Tetranychus urticae).
A total of 1,515 anthracnose-resistant selections were identified from the seedlings tested in Mississippi. Four of these resistant strawberry clones were subsequently released as breeding lines (Galletta et al., 1993) and have served as sources of anthracnose resistance in various breeding programs. Additionally, Smith et al. (1998) released the cultivar "Pelican," which is highly resistant to both anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum. "Pelican" also shows resistance to varieties of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae.
The evaluation of strawberry seedlings and advanced breeding lines from state and private breeding programs continues as an ongoing project. The USDA’s anthracnose-resistance screening procedure has effectively identified resistant genotypes in seedling progenies from the North Carolina State University breeding program, with over 32,000 resistant strawberry seedlings identified between 1998 and 1999 (Ballington et al., 2002).
Smith and Black (1987) found that resistance to C. fragariae was influenced by environmental conditions post-inoculation. Plants incubated at a high temperature (35°C) for 48 hours in a dew chamber (with relative humidity near 100%) exhibited higher disease severity ratings compared to those incubated at 25 or 30°C. Similarly, plants maintained in a greenhouse at 32°C after dew chamber incubation showed more severe symptoms than those held at 25°C. Notably, two- to four-week-old strawberry seedlings were more susceptible to C. fragariae than 14- to 18-week-old seedlings when inoculated with a conidial suspension (Smith et al., 1990).
Another strategy being pursued involves tissue culture-induced (somaclonal) variation.
Gupton and Smith (1991) determined that the estimates of dominance genetic variance were six to ten times higher than those for additive genetic variance. The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was bimodal, suggesting major gene action. Narrow-sense heritability estimates of 0.37 and 0.26 were probably sufficient to produce gains from recurrent selection, while gains from the selection of clonal value should be possible due to the high (0.87 and 0.85) broad-sense heritability estimates. Giménez and Ballington (2002) also found that nonadditive effects were more important than additive effects in the inheritance of resistance on runners. The epistatic nature of anthracnose resistance in runners appears to be supported by results from crosses between susceptible parents that resulted in up to 20% resistant seedlings (Ballington et al., 2002). Giménez and Ballington (2002) found that the frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies suggests that resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum on runners is quantitative. Results from Garcés et al. (2002) also support the theory that the inheritance of resistance to anthracnose is quantitative in nature.
Increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots may be related to the shift from matted-row culture to the annual plasticulture production system in the United States. Breeding for genetic resistance to anthracnose and the development of resistant cultivars are primary means for reducing economic losses due to this disease. This approach is environmentally sound because it results in reduced fungicide use. As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Simultaneously, the development of more effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses due to both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also decreased economic losses caused by these diseases. Nevertheless, growers may still face severe losses when environmental conditions are highly favorable for anthracnose development.
