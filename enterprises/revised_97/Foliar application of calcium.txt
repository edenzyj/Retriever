The effects of preharvest calcium chloride (CaCl₂) treatment on postharvest ripening and gray mold development in strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa) were assessed through two experiments conducted in 1987 at different sites. The first experiment investigated the effects of varying application rates of CaCl₂ and the maturity of the fruit at the time of treatment using the conventional cultivar 'Kent'. The second experiment focused on the concentration and frequency of CaCl₂ applications with the day-neutral cultivar 'Tribute'.
Results showed that calcium treatment led to a significant increase in calcium concentrations in both fruit and leaves, with a strong correlation observed between the two. The degree of fruit maturity at application and the frequency of treatment did not significantly influence calcium levels in the tissues.
During fruit storage at 4°C, several maturity indicators were measured, including anthocyanin and free sugar content, which increased, while titratable acidity and firmness decreased. In both experiments, CaCl₂ application successfully delayed ripening and gray mold development, with the delay being more pronounced at higher calcium concentrations.
Calcium plays a crucial role in regulating fruit ripening and maturation, as established by various studies on leaf senescence and fruit ripening. The application of calcium before and after harvest has been shown to prevent physiological disorders and extend shelf life for a range of fruits.
In the second experiment, the impact of calcium application rates on the 'Tribute' cultivar was evaluated. Plants were cultivated in a sandy loam soil, arranged with 60 cm spacing between plants, 1 m between rows, and 2 m between plots. Fertilization followed recommendations from the Québec Department of Agriculture. Postharvest ripening was assessed by measuring firmness, electrical conductivity, anthocyanins, free sugars, and titratable acidity, along with visual ratings of mold development.
Tingwa and Young (1974) noted that little attention has been given to strawberries, a fruit with a short shelf life and high susceptibility to mold (Eaves and Leefe, 1962; Maas, 1971). The present study demonstrates that foliar application of calcium (Ca) may have beneficial effects on strawberry fruit storage by delaying ripening and the development of gray mold (Botrytis cinerea).
Storage Conditions: Immediately after harvest, the fruit was precooled and selected for uniformity in size and color (one-fourth to one-half red) and absence of wounds. Berries were stored in 26-liter polyethylene containers under a continuous air stream at 4°C and close to 100% relative humidity (RH) for either 23 days (‘Tribute’) or 28 days (‘Kent’). Each container held 15 lots of 40 strawberries. The atmosphere composition in the containers was monitored using gas chromatography (model 29; Fisher-Hamilton Gas Partitioned, Ottawa, Ont.).
Materials and Methods: Two experiments were conducted in 1987 with two strawberry cultivars: the conventional ‘Kent’ and the day-neutral ‘Tribute’. Calcium determination was performed on exchangeable Ca in soil, leaves, and fruits using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. The samples were dried at 70°C and digested with nitric and perchloric acids, following the methods of Gaines and Mitchell (1979). The soil's Ca content was assessed using the Mehlich 3 analysis method (Mehlich, 1984).
Measurement of Senescence Criteria: Total anthocyanins were determined following the method by Fuleki and Francis (1968). Anthocyanins were extracted from a 10-g aliquot of a 20- to 30-fruit homogenate using acidified methanol, and results were expressed as absorbance (510 nm) per gram of fresh weight. Free sugars were quantified via refractometry (Bausch and Lomb optical series YB 3301; Bausch and Lomb, Rochester, N.Y.), with results expressed as percent free sugars. Titratable organic acids were measured as described by Morris et al. (1985). A 10-g homogenate from a 20- to 30-fruit sample was diluted to 100 g with deionized water and titrated with 0.1 N NaOH to pH 8.1, with results expressed as percent citric acid (El-Kazzaz et al., 1983). Electrical conductivity was measured on 10 strawberries in each replicate using electrodes placed 0.5 cm apart and embedded 0.4 cm deep at the tip of the fruit, connected to a conductivity bridge (YSI model 31; Yellow Springs, Ohio).

Mold was visually estimated using a scale from 0 to 10, where 10 indicates fruits completely covered with mold. Results are the means of 40 strawberries per replicate. At harvest, fruits were placed in petri dishes on SNA medium (Nirenberg, 1981), and the microorganisms were identified. After storage, microorganisms were identified directly on the strawberries.
Data Analysis: An analysis of variance of the results was conducted following a split-split-plot factorial design (Snedecor and Cochran, 1957). Homogeneity of variance was verified using the standard Bartlett test (Anderson and McLean, 1974). Each treatment was distributed across three randomized blocks. Orthogonal contrasts with one degree of freedom were employed to determine the response of the measured characteristics.
Determination of Calcium in Soil, Leaves, and Fruits: Calcium levels in leaves and fruits, although low, varied significantly in correlation with the soil Ca content. Foliar application of CaCl₂ led to an increase in Ca levels in both leaves and fruits in both experiments, with a more substantial increase in the first experiment (P < 0.01; 26% at 20 kg·ha⁻¹) compared to the second experiment (P < 0.05; 13%). In both experiments, the increase in Ca content of leaves and fruits was linearly correlated with the rate of application. Calcium levels in leaves and fruits were closely correlated (r = 0.97 and 0.88 for Experiments 1 and 2, respectively). Neither the degree of maturity at application (Experiment 1) nor repeated applications (Experiment 2) influenced the Ca content of the tissues. In Experiment 2, repeated applications did not affect the Ca content, but phytotoxicity symptoms were observed on the leaves after the second and third applications at 10 and 20 kg·ha⁻¹.
Effect of Calcium Treatment on Ripening: Anthocyanin levels increased during storage under all treatments, particularly in the control group. The color and rate of Ca application were linearly correlated. Although the surface of the berries was pink over one-fourth of the area, the anthocyanin amounts were very low due to dilution by the inner tissues.
Free sugars increased in both experiments during storage. This increase was delayed by the Ca treatments, showing a linear correlation with Ca concentration, with more pronounced effects observed at the end of storage. Organic acids slowly decreased during storage, with this decline also delayed by Ca treatment. The effect of Ca became noticeable after 10 days of storage and was linearly correlated with Ca concentration by day 28, especially in Experiment 1.
Electrical conductivity of the tissues increased rapidly between days 5 and 10 of storage for all treatments. After 10 days, the increase was less pronounced in the Ca-treated strawberries. By the end of storage, a linear correlation was noted between this increase and Ca concentration. The significance of the interaction between the rate of application and storage indicated that tissue conductivity varied during storage, depending on the dose of CaCl₂ applied.
Only Botrytis cinerea developed during storage at 4°C.

Mold (Botrytis cinerea) was observed after 5 and 12 days in Experiments 1 and 2, respectively. Calcium treatment caused a delay in mold development, especially near the end of storage, and this response was linearly correlated with the rate of application. The interaction between the dose of application and storage time was significant in both experiments.
The characteristic symptoms of ripening, such as an increase in free sugars, anthocyanins, and tissue conductivity; mold development; and a decrease in titratable acidity and firmness, were observed in the strawberries during storage. Foliar application of CaCl₂ three to nine days before harvest increased the calcium content in the tissues, delayed ripening, and prolonged storage life. The visual appearance of the Ca-treated fruits remained acceptable at the end of storage, unlike the controls. For most ripening characteristics, the effects of calcium were proportional to the rate of application, indicating a direct relationship between the calcium content in the tissues and the delay in ripening. This data aligns with findings from Eaves and Leefe (1962), who measured the effect of calcium on strawberry texture after storage. Similar effects have been noted in apples (Paliyath et al., 1984), pears (Richardson and Al-Alani, 1982), and avocados (Tingwa and Young, 1974). Calcium helps protect cellular organization (Jones and Lunt, 1970) and may prevent certain physiological disorders (Shear, 1975). It can also influence the structure and function of cell walls and membranes, as well as various aspects of cell metabolism (Glenn et al., 1988; Poovaiah, 1987). The delay in several signs of ripening, such as anthocyanin, free sugar, and organic acid content, provides evidence for the role of calcium in regulating cell biochemistry in strawberries.
The increase in tissue calcium content following treatment was not affected by the degree of maturity at the time of treatment or by the frequency of application. This may be explained by the relative immobility of calcium in tissues (Hanger, 1979), which is a known cause of calcium deficiency often observed in leaves and fruits (Ferguson, 1984). The lack of influence of repeated applications in Experiment 2 with 'Tribute' and the less pronounced response to calcium application may be attributed to higher calcium levels in the soil, leaves, and fruits in this experiment compared to Experiment 1. Exogenous calcium will only bind to cellular sites if those sites are not saturated (Conway and Sams, 1987). Therefore, calcium treatment of strawberries may only be beneficial when the calcium content of the tissues is below a critical threshold. Differences in the response to calcium application could also stem from variations in the cultivars' ability to accumulate calcium. The phytotoxic effects of repeated applications appear to be minimal (Bramlage et al., 1985).
Table 3 details the probability levels for maturity attributes of 'Kent' strawberries, including measures such as anthocyanins, free sugars, titratable organic acids, texture, electrical conductivity, and visual evaluation, assessed in Experiment 1.
Table 4 presents the probability levels for maturity attributes of 'Tribute' strawberries, covering aspects like free sugar content, titratable organic acids, texture, and visual evaluation, as examined in Experiment 2.
Although several fungi were identified on the strawberries at harvest, only Botrytis cinerea developed during storage at 4°C. Botrytis can grow at temperatures as low as -4°C (Sommer et al., 1973) and is a significant limitation to the storage life of strawberries. Calcium treatment delayed the development of Botrytis and likely reduced losses due to this pathogen. In conclusion, the foliar application of CaCl led to increased calcium content in strawberry fruits and delayed ripening and mold development. Determining leaf calcium content, which is closely correlated with fruit calcium content, may serve as an indicator of the need for calcium treatment.
