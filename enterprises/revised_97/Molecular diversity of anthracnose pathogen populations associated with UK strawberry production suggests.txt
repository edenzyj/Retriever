Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species—C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae—are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.

Colletotrichum acutatum s.l. was first described as a strawberry pathogen in California in 1983 and has since spread worldwide, including the UK, through runners and propagating material. An extensive genetic characterization of C. acutatum s.l., representing the global diversity of the pathogen, led to its subdivision into genetic groups named A1 to A9. More recently, C. acutatum s.l. has been subdivided into over 30 species based on multilocus phylogeny.
The first record of C. acutatum s.l. in the UK was in 1978, found on Anemone sp. grown in Jersey. In 1982, the first incidence of anthracnose disease in strawberries caused by C. acutatum s.l. was recorded in the UK, attributed to the importation of infected strawberry runners from the USA. DNA sequences in public databases suggest that two UK isolates (CBS198.35 and CBS199.35), collected in 1935 from Phormium spp. (New Zealand flax), belong to C. acutatum s.l. CABI database records from 1978 to 1983 show the incidence of the pathogen on various hosts and in different UK locations. However, it seems improbable that the initial outbreak on strawberries led to widespread dispersal of the pathogen. In 1993, Lovelidge proposed that continued introduction of infected strawberry material from abroad made the disease likely to become endemic in the UK. Subsequent years saw further outbreaks on strawberries linked to the importation of infected propagation material, mainly from mainland Europe, as well as on other important crop hosts.
Strawberry anthracnose symptoms from the two Colletotrichum species complexes are similar and can appear on all parts of the plant. Flower blight and fruit rot are common symptoms in the field, while lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are typically found in plant nurseries. Crown symptomatology is characterized by reddish-brown necrotic areas, and in some cases, stunting and chlorosis have been associated with root necrosis.
Research has characterized C. acutatum s.l. populations related to strawberries in specific geographic areas, including Israel, France, Bulgaria, Spain, Belgium, and other European countries, as well as in specific regions of the USA. Other studies have attempted to characterize C. acutatum s.l. related to strawberries using isolates collected worldwide, employing genomic fingerprinting techniques (such as RFLP and apPCR) and sequence analysis based on the ITS region. Results indicate at least one representative clonal population, suggesting a single source of origin, and indicate that the disease spreads through infected propagation material. However, ITS sequences alone or genomic fingerprinting are not adequate to discriminate among the newly assigned species designations.
A recent study, analyzing over two decades of anthracnose incidence data gathered by plant health authorities, identified trade as the primary route of entry and establishment of C. acutatum in UK strawberry production. During this period, various nurseries imported planting material into the UK, with at least 55 cases of infested material planted in the field through imports that were not intercepted by border inspection posts.
A diverse collection of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato was assembled for this study, including 67 isolates associated with strawberry production in the UK (obtained from the UK Food and Environment Research Agency, FERA, which is responsible for plant health within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), 27 C. acutatum sensu lato isolates collected from strawberries in other countries, and 13 isolates collected from other host species in the UK. For further comparison, 33 additional isolates were included to represent other genetic groups and novel species from previous studies. This included two isolates of C. fruticola, two isolates of C. aenigma (belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex) associated with strawberries, two UK isolates of C. spinaciae, and one isolate each of C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, and C. fioriniae. Sequence data for the markers were retrieved from the reference genome sequences available from GenBank for C. graminicola and C. higginsianum (accession numbers: ACOD01000000 and CACQ02000000, respectively), which were used as out-groups in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 1). Details of the isolate collection used in the present study are provided in Table 1.
Cultures were maintained at 25 °C on potato dextrose agar medium (PDA, Difco Laboratories, USA) for up to ten days under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle. Long-term storage at 4 °C involved cutting mycelial plugs from the edge of actively growing cultures on PDA and suspending them in sterile water.
Genomic DNA was extracted according to the Chelex 100 protocol, with some modifications. DNA was quantified using a NanoDrop ND-1000 spectrophotometer (Thermo Scientific, DE, USA).
Various target regions were used to characterize genetic diversity among the fungal isolates, including the ITS region, partial sequence of the beta-tubulin 2 gene (TUB) (exons 3 through 6, including introns 2 through 4), partial sequence of the glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) gene, and partial sequence of the mating type gene (MAT1-2) (the intron included in the conserved HMG box region). Target regions were amplified using PCR reaction mixes (20 µL) that contained 1 µL of DNA, 1 µL each of primer (20 µM), 7 µL of H₂O, and 10 µL of ReadyMix RedTaq (Sigma).
PCR amplification of the target regions for sequencing was carried out using previously published primers under standardized conditions for routine work. For ITS, primers ITS1Ext and ITS4Ext were used. The amplification program consisted of 2 minutes of initial denaturation (95 °C), followed by 30 cycles of amplification (1 minute at 94 °C, 1 minute at 55 °C, and 1 minute at 72 °C), with a final extension at 72 °C for 5 minutes. For TUB, primers TB5 and TB6 were used, following a similar amplification program with initial denaturation at 95 °C, 30 cycles (1 minute at 94 °C, 1 minute at 65 °C, and 1 minute at 72 °C), and a final extension at 72 °C.
The PCR conditions included an initial denaturation at 95°C for 5 minutes, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation at 95°C for 30 seconds, annealing at 48°C and 55°C for 30 seconds, and extension at 72°C for 30 seconds, culminating in a final extension of 20 minutes at 72°C. The PCR products were separated using gel electrophoresis and purified with the QIAquick PCR purification kit (Qiagen, USA).
Sequencing of the PCR products was performed at the University of Warwick Genomics Centre, utilizing either the ABI Prism 7900HT or ABI3100 sequence detection system (Applied Biosystems, UK). The PCR products were cleaned up and quantified against a ladder (Bioline EasyLadder I) containing DNA fragments of known concentrations. For sequencing reactions with the BigDye Terminator v3.1 cycle sequencing kit (Applied Biosystems, UK), one to five microliters of each sample, depending on DNA concentration, were used. ABI trace files were analyzed, and consensus sequences were generated using Geneious 7.1.6. All sequences were aligned using MUSCLE (http://www.ebi.ac.uk/Tools/msa/muscle/) and manually edited as necessary to optimize the alignment. Multiple alignments were trimmed at both ends to ensure comparable nucleotides.
The multiple sequence alignments were exported to MEGA5, where best-fit substitution models were calculated for each separate sequence dataset. To evaluate whether the four sequenced loci were congruent and suitable for concatenation, tree topologies were constructed using 50% Neighbour-Joining bootstrap and maximum parsimony analysis (100,000 replicates) for each gene, with results visually compared. The multilocus concatenated alignment (ITS, TUB2, MAT1-2, and GAPDH) was performed with Geneious 7.1.6. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was employed to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes 3.2.1 for the combined sequence datasets. Nucleotide substitution models for each gene, as determined by MEGA5, were applied to each locus. The analysis in MrBayes ran for 5,000,000 generations to reach a P value lower than 0.01, employing two parallel searches with three heated and one cold Markov chain, sampling every 100 generations, with 25% of generations discarded as burn-in. Further phylogenetic analysis was conducted by...

Fig 2. Percentage occurrence of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato species and relative numbers of haplotypes identified among 67 strains isolated from strawberry in the UK.
The neighbour-joining method with 1,000 bootstrap replicates under Kimura's two-parameter correction was used, with results presented in Figs 1 and 2.
The 67 fungal isolates collected from strawberries in the UK were compared with a subset of other isolates (chosen based on genetic, host, and geographic diversity), which included 49 isolates of C. acutatum s.l. and four isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.l. For in vitro growth studies on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA, BD Difco), a 7 mm diameter mycelial plug excised from the edge of an actively growing PDA culture was placed at the center of a fresh PDA plate.
In the growth experiment, two perpendicular colony diameters were measured daily, and the colony radius was calculated from cultures incubated at four different temperatures (15°C, 20°C, 25°C, and 30°C) in darkness. Data corresponding to the linear growth phase were subjected to analysis of variance of regression to create growth curves for each isolate at each temperature. Three plates were used as replicates in both tests. Statistical analysis was performed using SIGMAPLOT 10 software (Sigmaplot Software, USA). Colony characteristics were recorded after 15 days of incubation at 25°C under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Representative isolates (highlighted with asterisks in Table 1) of each C. acutatum s.l. group isolated from strawberries in the UK, along with reference isolates from other hosts, were used for pathogenicity tests on the generally susceptible strawberry cultivar Elsanta. A conidial suspension was prepared for each isolate by flooding 10-day-old PDA culture plates with sterile deionized water. The spore concentration was adjusted to 10^5 spores/ml for fruit inoculation and 10^6 spores/ml for crown inoculation.
Unripe fruits (white fruit beginning to turn pink, as shown in Fig 3A) were inoculated with a 5 µl drop of conidial suspension. Before inoculation, fruit surfaces were disinfected for 5 minutes using NaClO (1% active chlorine) in 50% ethanol, washed three times in sterilized water, blotted dry, and placed in a tray with moist sand on the bottom to prevent movement during further procedures. After inoculation, the fruits were incubated at 25°C under a 12-hour light/12-hour dark cycle.
Disease symptoms were evaluated 7 days after inoculation (d.a.i.) (Fig 3B) by recording the incidence of disease (percentage of infected fruits) and the aggressiveness of lesion development.
Fig 3. Strawberry fruits and plants used for pathogenicity tests (A and C) and symptoms (B and D). (A) Unripe fruits (phenological stage turning white-pink) used for artificial inoculations of Colletotrichum spp. (B) Strawberry fruits 7 days after inoculation with Colletotrichum sp. spore suspension showing typical black spot symptoms (bottom left) and with sterile water used as control (top right). (C) Three-month-old strawberry plants used for pathogenicity assays. (D) Strawberry plant crown sectioned, showing the presence of red-brownish lesions characteristic of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp.
The following severity scale was used: 0 for no visible lesions; 1 for lesions on less than 33% of the fruit surface; 2 for lesions covering 33-66% of the fruit surface; and 3 for lesions covering more than 66% of the fruit surface. Three fruits inoculated with sterile distilled water (SDW), along with fresh fruits, served as non-inoculated controls. Four independent replicates were tested for each fungal isolate, with each replicate consisting of three inoculated fruits. At the end of the experiment, Colletotrichum isolates were re-isolated from infected fruits and cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) to confirm colony characteristics.
The capability of the isolates to produce crown rot symptoms was evaluated by injecting the crowns of three-month-old strawberry plants (see Fig. 3C) with 0.2 mL of conidial suspension using a syringe. The plants were placed in a glasshouse at 23°C with a 16-hour light and 8-hour darkness cycle. After 24 days post-inoculation (d.a.i.), the plants were evaluated for the presence of crown tissues exhibiting red-brown discoloration, wilting, and collapse, which are typical symptoms of Colletotrichum crown rot. The severity scale for this evaluation was as follows: 0 for no lesions; 1 for crown tissue discoloration without wilting or collapse; 2 for wilting or collapse of part of the plant; and 3 for plant death. All crowns were sectioned and examined for the presence of red-brown lesions (see Fig. 3D). Crown infection was confirmed through the re-isolation of the pathogen. Three plant crowns injected with SDW, as well as untouched plants, served as negative controls for each replicate. The experiment was independently replicated three times, with six plants per replicate.
Values of disease severity were used to calculate a Disease Index (DI, average severity) using the following formula: DI = Σ(vn) / N, where v represents the numeric value of the class, n is the number of plants or fruits assigned to the class, and N is the total number of plants or fruits assessed. Data from pathogenicity tests on both fruits and plants were subjected to analysis of variance (ANOVA), with means compared using Tukey's multiple range test via Systat 11 (Systat Software, USA).
Phylogenetic trees were constructed using a combined dataset of ITS, TUB2, GADPH, and MAT1-2 sequences, consisting of 148 Colletotrichum isolates (see Table 1). As shown in Fig. 1, most of the C. acutatum sensu lato isolates (49 out of 67) were identified as belonging to C. nymphaeae (A2 genetic group), based on high bootstrap values clustering with reference isolates CBS 797.72, PT135, IMI345028, and other genetically similar isolates (identical sites = 1422/1438 or 98.9%; pairwise identity = 99.9%). A smaller proportion of isolates in the diversity collection (12 out of 67) were identified as belonging to C. godetiae (A4 genetic group) based on genetic clustering with reference isolates ALMNRB-30K, CBS 193.32, and JL198 (identical sites = 1411/1438 or 94.6%; pairwise identity = 99.4%). Finally, six isolates were identified as belonging to C. fioriniae (A3 genetic group) based on clustering with the reference isolate ATCC 56813 (identical sites = 1436/1443 or 99.5%; pairwise identity = 99.9%).
Molecular characterization was performed on 67 Colletotrichum isolates collected from strawberries in the UK.
The radial growth data of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.l. isolates were subjected to analysis of variance regression to obtain statistically significant growth curves (R² = 0.9447 and P < 0.0001), with one exception: the isolate C. nymphaeae CSL224 at 30 °C, which showed R² = 0.770. The slope for each isolate (three replicates per isolate) within the same species was averaged to detect the hypothetical optimal growth temperature, with results summarized in Table 2. Most species, particularly those containing isolates from strawberry in the UK, namely C. nymphaeae, C. fioriniae, and C. godetiae, exhibited the highest growth rates at 25 °C, which was considered the optimum temperature. It is noteworthy that higher levels of strawberry anthracnose incidence in the UK have been reported in the southwest and southeast regions, where relatively high temperatures are frequently reached. However, C. phormii, C. kinghornii, and C. rhombiforme demonstrated the highest growth rates at 20 °C and did not grow at 30 °C. Interestingly, these three species are closely related evolutionarily, indicating a specific adaptation to different environmental conditions compared to other members of the same complex.
Regarding C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates (C. aenigma CSL780, CSL869; C. fruticola CSL311, CSL386), all four isolates exhibited the highest growth rates at all tested temperatures compared to the other isolates.
Table 2 presents the radial growth rates (in mm h⁻¹) of various Colletotrichum species at different temperatures (15 °C, 20 °C, 25 °C, and 30 °C). Each species is listed with its respective growth rates along with standard deviations. The out-group species C. aenigma and C. fruticola are shown to have the highest growth rates across all temperatures tested. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, including C. rhombiforme, C. kinghornii, and C. phormii, shows reduced growth rates, particularly at 30 °C, where some species exhibit zero growth. The optimal growth temperatures for each species are indicated in bold, highlighting the species' varying adaptability to temperature.
Thirty-four Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) isolates were selected for pathogenicity tests on fruits and plants. This included six representative isolates from each of the three species associated with strawberry production in the UK (highlighted in Table 1 and in bold in Fig. 1) and one or more isolates representative of all the major species in the C. acutatum complex. Four C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates, obtained from strawberry-infected tissues in the UK (CSL 780 and CSL 869, C. aenigma) and the USA (CSL 311 and CSL 386, C. fruticola), were included as an out-group.
Colletotrichum acutatum s.l. isolates displayed varying levels of aggressiveness on both host tissues. In fruit assays, among the three species identified from UK strawberry production systems, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae were more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This was particularly notable for isolates originating from strawberry, as indicated by the fruit disease index range: C. nymphaeae (2.08–3.00), C. fioriniae (1.92–2.75), and C. godetiae (0.75–2.08). Interestingly, for isolates from other hosts, C. nymphaeae isolates were less aggressive (0.67–1.67), while one or more isolates of C. fioriniae (2.00–2.17) and C. godetiae (2.17) exhibited disease indices similar to those of the strawberry isolates. Among other species tested within the C. acutatum complex, C. acutatum sensu stricto (s.s.), C. simmondsii, and Colletotrichum sp. 2 included one or more isolates from non-strawberry hosts that showed medium levels of aggressiveness, with a fruit disease index ranging from 1.17 to 2.08. In contrast, C. lupini (0.08–0.75), C. phormii (0.58), C. salicis (0.17–0.67), and C. rhombiforme (0.67), along with Colletotrichum sp. 1 (0.33) from various non-strawberry hosts, were much less aggressive, as indicated by the fruit disease index. The C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates tested showed a fruit disease index ranging from 1.50 to 2.50 (see Table 3).
In the in vitro assays, anthracnose fruit rot symptoms were observed (e.g., Fig. 3B) for various isolates tested, displaying different levels of aggressiveness as reflected by the disease index, which ranged from 0.08 to 3.0 (see Table 3). The variation in aggressiveness among different isolates was evident from the incidence rates, which ranged from 8.33% to 100%, with only four out of 38 isolates showing incidence rates of 91.7% to 100%. Lesion types varied, ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 (see S1 Table). Upon evaluating lesion morphology, different types of lesions could be distinguished on fruits, ranging from brown lesions containing orange conidia to those fully covered with aerial mycelium, varying in size. The isolate C. nymphaeae CSL 899 was the most aggressive on strawberry fruits, with the highest disease index (3.0), indicating symptoms covering more than 66% of the fruit surface.
In plant assays, varying degrees of crown rot symptoms were recorded 24 days after inoculation (d.a.i.), reflected by the disease index range shown in Table 3. Symptom severity was generally low, with no isolate scoring higher than 2 (indicating wilting and collapse of the plant). Among the three species identified from UK strawberry production systems, C. fioriniae isolates from strawberry showed a higher disease index range (0.72–1.00) compared to C. nymphaeae (0.5–0.83) and C. godetiae (0.39–0.67). The C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolate CSL 311 (C. fruticola from strawberry in the USA) exhibited the highest disease index (1.6) and was also among the most aggressive on fruit (see Table 3). Colletotrichum isolates were recovered from all crowns exhibiting symptoms.
Based on four sequence loci (ITS, TUB, GAPDH, and MAT1-2), the Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato isolates were assigned to three newly designated species: C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, following a recent taxonomic re-assessment [18]. According to available literature, C. nymphaeae is the most common species, while C. godetiae is also frequently reported in European and American strawberry fields [6]. These two species were the most representative in our dataset of isolates related to strawberries in the UK. C. fioriniae has a worldwide distribution and is common on strawberries, but only a few isolates were identified in our collection, and this group was not commonly present in the fields in the UK.
Table 3 presents variability in aggressiveness among Colletotrichum species isolates on strawberry fruits and plants. It details various isolates along with their species, isolation sources, and origins. Each isolate is accompanied by two indices: the fruit disease index and the plant disease index, indicating the severity of disease symptoms. The fruit disease index scores range from 0 to 3, reflecting the proportion of the fruit surface affected by lesions. The plant disease index similarly measures the impact on plant health. The table also notes significant differences in these indices, as indicated by different letters within the same column, suggesting variability in aggressiveness among the isolates. The results are averages derived from multiple replicates, emphasizing the methodological rigor in assessing the disease severity.
Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato, along with C. salicis and C. miyabeana, is commonly found on strawberries in Oceania but has only been sporadically detected in Europe. Isolates of these species have not been identified on strawberries in the UK. The variability observed within the UK populations of C. acutatum sensu lato aligns, in part, with previous reports of C. acutatum on strawberries in specific geographic regions. For instance, in countries such as France, Israel, Bulgaria, and Spain, most strawberry anthracnose pathogen isolates clustered into the same species, C. nymphaeae, with minimal intra-specific diversity observed within each country. In contrast, Belgian isolates exhibited a different composition: 33% belonged to C. nymphaeae, 5% to C. fioriniae, 50% to C. godetiae, 3% to C. acutatum sensu stricto, and 6% to C. salicis. The C. acutatum sensu lato status in the UK may stem from a recent introduction in the late 1970s from a limited number of sources. The reasons behind the varying occurrences of different Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry production across geographic locations remain unclear; however, the sources of imported planting materials and local trade practices are heavily implicated.
The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems.
This study underscores the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of introduced anthracnose pathogen populations belonging to three distinct Colletotrichum species. It emphasizes the necessity for effective phytosanitary procedures related to pathogen monitoring and characterization to limit the entry of non-native pathogens. Additionally, it highlights the need for reliable and rapid diagnostic tools for ongoing research and practical applications in strawberry anthracnose management. The recent release of the whole genome sequence of C. fioriniae isolated from strawberries, along with newly characterized isolates based on multi-locus sequence and aggressiveness data reported here, provides a valuable platform for further investigations into the genetic basis of C. acutatum sensu lato interactions with strawberries.
