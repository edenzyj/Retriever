La dispersion des parasites des végétaux par les éclaboussures de pluie ou le vent est un facteur critique du développement épidémique de plusieurs maladies. Cependant, jusqu'à récemment, la dispersion par éclaboussures n'a été que sporadiquement étudiée par rapport à la dispersion par le vent. Au cours des douze dernières années, nous avons examiné la dispersion par éclaboussures de Phytophthora cactorum et de Colletotrichum acutatum à trois niveaux hiérarchiques : l'éclaboussement dû à l'impact d'une goutte d'eau, le transport des spores par une pluie artificielle sur de petites surfaces, et la dispersion de la maladie dans le champ par la pluie naturelle.
Le nombre d'éclaboussures produites, le nombre de spores disséminées et la distance parcourue par les éclaboussures augmentent avec la taille des gouttes de pluie, ce qui influence leur vélocité et leur énergie cinétique. Cependant, la distance de transport est très courte, généralement moins de 15 cm à chaque éclaboussement, indiquant que l'atterrissage des spores sur un site d'infection potentiel résulte d'éclaboussements répétés de gouttelettes portant des spores à travers le terrain et le couvert végétal. La nature du terrain et du couvert végétal peut donc avoir un effet significatif sur la dispersion de la maladie : une rugosité accrue de la surface du sol et une densité de couvert végétal plus élevée réduisent la dispersion par éclaboussures. Des pluies de très courte durée (i.e. < 2 min) peuvent entraîner une dispersion appréciable, mais l'intensité de la pluie augmente à la fois la dispersion originale des spores et la perte de spores à travers le sol et le couvert végétal.
La dispersion par éclaboussures est un élément critique dans le développement de nombreuses maladies des plantes (Fitt & McCartney, 1986). Bien qu'il puisse y avoir plus de pathogènes fongiques dont les spores sont dispersées par le vent que par la pluie (Gregory, 1973), on peut soutenir que l'occurrence et la durée des épisodes de pluie limitent les épidémies causées par des pathogènes dispersés par la pluie plus que le mouvement de l'air ne limite celles causées par des pathogènes dispersés par le vent. Cela est dû au fait que les épisodes de pluie sont des événements sporadiques ou même chaotiques comparés au mouvement de l'air.
Étonnamment, malgré l'importance de la dispersion par éclaboussures, les détails physiques du phénomène n'ont été étudiés en profondeur que récemment (Fitt & McCartney, 1986; McCartney & Fitt, 1985; Madden, 1992). Fitt et McCartney (1986) ainsi que Fitt et al. (1989) décrivent de nombreuses caractéristiques des champignons dispersés par éclaboussures. Les spores sont souvent à paroi fine, hyalines, entourées de mucilage, et peuvent être produites dans des pycnides, acervuli ou sur des stromata. De nombreuses maladies importantes des légumineuses sont causées par ces types de champignons. Parmi les exemples figurent le blight ascochyta, causé par Ascochyta fabae f. sp. lentis (pycnides), et l'anthracnose, causée par Colletotrichum truncatum (acervuli) (Morrall, 1997). Comprendre ces maladies dépend en partie de la compréhension de la dispersion des pathogènes.
L'objectif de cet article est de décrire certaines des caractéristiques clés de la dispersion par éclaboussures. La plupart des exemples proviendront de nos expériences précédentes et en cours sur l'anthracnose de la fraise, causée par Colletotrichum acutatum, et la pourriture du cuir de la fraise, causée par Phytophthora cactorum. Nos études ont traité de la dispersion à trois niveaux : l'éclaboussement provenant de l'impact d'une goutte d'eau unique, le transport de spores lors de simulations de pluie sur de petites zones, et la propagation de la maladie sur le terrain.
Raindrops vary between 0.02 and 0.5 cm in diameter, with most being less than 0.2 cm (Ulbrich 1983). However, most splashes are caused only by larger drops (>0.2 cm). Surface properties significantly affect the results (Fitt et al. 1992). The splash generated from a dry target depends on the surface's inclination, flexibility, and whether the surface is hydrophilic or hydrophobic. Generally, if the surface is wet, the splash droplets consist of a mixture of the surface water and the impacting drop. If there are spores on the target or within the surface water film, some of these will be entrained in the splash droplets (Fitt et al. 1989). Surface microtopography (i.e., roughness) also has a considerable influence on splashing (Yang et al. 1990b, Yang & Madden 1993, Madden 1993), with the magnitude of splash distance increasing as roughness decreases.
D) is a good predictor of mean results, although the underlying physical principles are not yet fully understood.
N(D), one can, in theory, relate the results from single-drop impacts to the population of raindrops of various sizes impacting during a specific time interval.
Using exposed immature strawberry fruit as a bioassay for dispersal, we have found that high levels of splash dispersal occur with very short rain durations. For instance, fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum can be found at 30 cm from the inoculum source in as little as 30 seconds of rain (at 15 mm/h). By 2 minutes of rain, over 50% of the fruit become infected. Percentages are lower at 60 cm from the source, as expected based on dispersal gradients from point sources. The percentage of fruit infected by Phytophthora cactorum is less than that for C. acutatum, but a high incidence is found after more than 4 minutes of rain.
The fruit bioassay has been used to explore the effects of several factors on dispersal. For instance, a 2 m/s wind roughly doubles fruit disease incidence downwind compared to upwind (at 60 cm). With a 7° surface inclination, disease incidence downhill from the inoculum source is roughly double that for uphill. Surface roughness also greatly affects fruit infection, with the highest incidence for plastic surfaces and the lowest for straw mulch. An initially unexpected result was that increasing rain intensity does not necessarily lead to increased disease incidence. Using a rain simulator, we found that susceptible plant parts do not have to be present when the original spore dispersal occurs. The inoculum source fruit and the entire surface can be exposed to rain; the source fruit can then be removed, healthy (target) fruit added, and the entire surface can be rained on for another 4 or 16 minutes. Sufficient spores are released from the source over a few minutes to be resplashed and deposited onto healthy fruit during subsequent rains.
Although using infected fruit as a measure of spore dispersal is convenient, it does not provide high enough spatial or temporal resolution to characterize dispersal for some studies. A more complete measure of spore dispersal would involve counting and measuring individual splash droplets and microscopically determining the number of spores per droplet.
In the context provided, there are references to figures that illustrate data. However, since the original text does not allow for tables or figures to be displayed, the descriptions of the figures (e.g., showing the incidence of infected strawberry fruit at different distances and rain durations) can be noted but not visually represented. If you need further information or adjustments, feel free to ask!
Due to the short-range nature of splash events, most splash droplets containing spores are deposited on infection sites only after multiple resplashings. Each splash involves an interaction between the water droplet and the surface, meaning the properties of the surface significantly affect the results (Madden 1992). We have demonstrated that surface roughness, measured as the standard deviation of elevation (crE) (Huang & Bradford 1992), is an excellent predictor of the magnitude of splash dispersal (Yang et al. 1990a, Madden 1992). The steepness of the dispersal gradient is directly related to crE. Moreover, the integrated total number of colonies over the entire experimental area during the rain episode (X) increases as crE decreases. These findings are supported by additional experiments showing that the number and mass (volume) of splashed water droplets increase with decreasing roughness (Yang & Madden 1993). The overall dynamics of colony numbers (and hence spore deposition) over time and distance can be described by a diffusion equation (Yang et al. 1991a).
In Figure 3, the average number of colonies of Colletotrichum acutatum is illustrated in relation to distance from an inoculum source for three surfaces: plastic, soil, and straw. The colony numbers are normalized so that all three curves have the same value at a distance of 0 cm. The slopes of the relationship between the natural logarithm of colonies per square centimeter per minute and the squared distance are -0.5, -1.1, and -2.3/cm² for plastic, soil, and straw, respectively (Yang et al., 1990a).
We generated rain with intensities ranging from 2 to 60 mm/h (1.2 to 4.9 mL cm⁻² h⁻¹), which replicated the drop volume distributions of natural rains. This allowed us to quantify the relationship between rain intensity and the dispersal of C. acutatum (Madden et al. 1996). The total number of colonies, calculated for a circular area with a radius of 100 cm over 46 minutes, increased linearly with rain intensity (Figure 4). However, the proportion of infected fruit in a bioassay for dispersal increased with rain intensity, peaking at about 3.5 mL cm⁻² h⁻¹ with the simulator before declining somewhat (also see Fig. 3 in Madden et al. 1996). The reasons for this decline are explored through the partitioning of rain splash into three interrelated components, as discussed in Madden (1992).
I compared the inoculum source being outside the canopy (Boudreau & Madden, 1995). Besides altering the transfer of droplets across the surface (as with surface roughness), the canopy is postulated to both reduce spore removal from the source fruit and resplashing of droplets by directly intercepting incident rain. The effects of rainfall on splash dispersal have been documented (e.g., Madden & Ellis, 1990; Yang, 2000).
Table Description: The table presents data on the total number of colonies of Colletotrichum acutatum observed over 46 minutes within a circular area of 100 cm radius. It outlines the relationship between different rain intensities (measured in milliliters per hour per square centimeter), leaf area index (LAI), and the number of plants per row. Each rain intensity level (12.5, 25.0, 37.5, and 50.0 ml/h/cm²) shows varying totals of fungal colonies and proportions of strawberry fruit infected by C. acutatum at a distance of 60 cm from the inoculum source after 16 minutes of simulated rain. Regression lines based on the analysis by Boudreau and Madden (1995) provide insight into these relationships, demonstrating that increasing rain intensity may actually reduce disease incidence.
Disease spread in the field is expectedly associated with rain events. However, as discussed previously (Madden, 1992; Madden et al., 1996), efforts to quantify properties of rain in relation to disease outbreaks or rates of disease development have yielded mixed results. Even when rain occurs, other weather variables, such as temperature, may correlate with disease variables just as strongly or even more so than rain itself. Given the complex effects of rain intensity, it is unsurprising that predicting disease increases based solely on rainfall is challenging.
Variations in crop canopy (Shaw & Royle, 1993) and soil surface conditions (e.g., roughness) (Madden et al., 1993; Stedman, 1980) can significantly influence splash dispersal outcomes. Due to the short flight distances of splash droplets, dispersal gradients typically steepen in the field. For instance, in the case of strawberry anthracnose, disease incidence generally declines to nearly 0 at a distance of 2 meters from the inoculum source. Most gradients can be described by an exponential model (Fitt et al., 1989), although Pedersen and Morrall (1994) found that a power model (Campbell & Madden, 1990) provided a better fit for dispersal gradient data concerning ascochyta blight of lentil, indicating steeper and longer-distance gradients than those typically associated with rain-splashed pathogens.
Figure Description: Figure 5 illustrates the mean proportion of strawberry fruit infected by Colletotrichum acutatum in relation to distance from the inoculum source in field plots. It features solid and broken lines that represent the near and far sides of the crop rows for each distance category, highlighting the significant decrease in infection rates as the distance from the inoculum increases. Data for this figure were sourced from Madden and Boudreau (unpublished).
A generalized linear model analysis indicated that plant density had a significant but nonlinear effect (P < 0.01) on disease incidence. Wind-borne droplets and aerosols with spores play a larger role in the dissemination of Alternaria fabae than other pathogens (Pedersen et al., 1994). Dispersal results for surface topography found with our rain simulator (Yang et al., 1990a) were validated in the field (Madden et al., 1993). The highest disease incidence was observed with plastic ground cover, while the lowest (virtually zero) was with straw. Disease incidence with soil was intermediate between plastic and straw.
Plant density also affected dispersal in the field, and there was a nonlinear change in disease incidence (y) with plant density (Madden and Boudreau, unpublished; Table 2), which aligns with the rain simulator results (Boudreau & Madden, 1995). Although y generally decreased with increasing density, the highest y was associated with an intermediate plant density (Table 2). The distance at which v declined to 0.10 (jt₁₀), an inverse measure of gradient steepness, generally decreased with increasing crop density. For example, in 1992, x₀ was approximately 2 m with the lowest density and 1.6 m with the highest density. A stronger indication of plant density effects is the higher mean disease incidence on the near side (closest to the inoculum) than on the far side of plant rows at the same distance from the inoculum source (example in Fig. 5).
A fuller understanding of the effects of rain splash on the dispersal of fungal spores is emerging. Based on detailed investigations using single-drop impactions and rain simulators, quantitative information is now available on the splash process, spore entrainment in droplets, and droplet transport across surfaces and through canopies. Considerable research is still needed to translate controlled-study findings into field applications. For instance, it is not yet known how to formally link spore dispersal to rainfall properties (e.g., intensity) integrated over the duration of rain episodes. Controlled studies have not yet provided adequate guidance on the effects of variations in rain intensity during a rain event, despite it being well established that intensity varies highly over time. Likewise, the interaction of rain variables with pathogen, crop, and physical factors requires considerably more investigation.
