Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an economically important woody nut and edible oil tree worldwide. However, walnut production is limited by walnut anthracnose, a devastating disease that causes significant yield losses. Studying the etiology of anthracnose on walnut, as well as the virulence of pathogens and their sensitivities to fungicides, would be beneficial for effective control. This study aimed to identify the pathogen responsible for walnut anthracnose and reveal the population diversity through assessments of virulence, fungicide sensitivities, and genetic variation. A total of 13 single-spore Colletotrichum isolates were collected from walnut anthracnose-diseased fruits and leaves in 13 commercial orchards across Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces in China. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) based on multilocus phylogenetic analyses (internal transcribed spacer, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase), as well as morphological and cultural characteristics, and pathogenicity. Inoculation of the same walnut tissue with different isolates resulted in varying disease lesion sizes. The results indicated considerable differences in the virulence of all isolates, with no correlation to geographic origins. The virulence observed in walnut leaves and fruits inoculated with the same isolate was also significantly different. Based on their virulence to walnut leaves and fruits, the 13 isolates were categorized into three groups. Notably, 69.2% of the isolates exhibited higher virulence to walnut fruits compared to leaves, while 15.4% of isolates showed no virulence at all.
Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is a significant woody nut and edible oil tree globally. Walnut trees are primarily cultivated for their nuts, which are predominantly utilized for food and oil production (Blomhoff et al. 2006; Cortés et al. 2006). However, walnut production faces threats from various insects and diseases (Khan and Kundoo 2018; Tian et al. 1991; Wang and Tang 2018). Among these, anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a crucial challenge to walnut production in numerous growing areas worldwide, often leading to substantial yield losses or even total crop failure in certain orchards (Da Lio et al. 2018; Wang et al. 2016). In Shandong province, China, walnut anthracnose is typically observed from late June until harvest.

The sensitivity ranges of the isolates to various fungicides were 0.2 to 1.6 mg/ml and 0.002 to 0.2 mg/ml, respectively, with average values of 6.5 to 6.9 mg/ml, 1.5 to 0.6 mg/ml, 0.9 to 0.4 mg/ml, and 0.1 to 0.05 mg/ml, respectively. All isolates were more sensitive to difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim than to tebuconazole (P < 0.01). However, sensitivities to the same fungicide varied among isolates. Specifically, isolates SL-31 and TS-09 were the least sensitive to carbendazim and tebuconazole, with resistance ratios of 87.3 and 51.6, respectively. Sensitivities to difenoconazole and flusilazole were largely consistent across all isolates, with resistance ratios ranging from 1 to 4.6 and from 1 to 7, respectively. Therefore, difenoconazole and flusilazole could be recommended for disease control. Notably, differences in pathogenicity and fungicide sensitivity were not correlated with geographic regions. These findings indicate a high level of intraspecific diversity within the populations of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides s.s. responsible for walnut anthracnose. For effective management, a targeted control strategy should be developed based on different geographic regions.
In mid- to late July, the spots observed were approximately 5 to 10 mm in diameter. By mid-August, some of these spots merged into larger necrotic areas, leading to abnormal development or premature dropping of fruits and leaves. The fruits and leaves infected in August would shed extensively before harvest (late August to early September) (Zhu et al. 2014).
The genus Colletotrichum Corda is one of the most important and destructive plant pathogens globally. Scientifically and economically, Colletotrichum is considered the eighth most significant group of phytopathogenic fungi, capable of attacking over 3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants (Dean et al. 2012; Manire et al. 2002; O'Connell et al. 2012), including numerous crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2010; Honger et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2016). Several species of Colletotrichum have been isolated from Juglans regia, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato in Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa (Chen 2003; Cho and Shin 2004; Crous et al. 2000; Gadgil et al. 2005; Gorter 1977; Kobayashi 2007; Pennycook 1989); Colletotrichum sp. in Mexico (Alvarez 1976); C. gloeosporioides from walnut fruits in Slovenia, which caused spots on green walnut fruits (Juhašová et al. 2005); Colletotrichum godetiae in Australia (Damm et al. 2012); Colletotrichum acutatum in Australia (Simmonds 1966); and C. acutatum sensu lato (s.l.; geographic origin and pathogenicity unknown) (Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas 2005). In France, Colletotrichum fioriniae, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides s.l. were isolated from walnut leaves, nuts, and buds, and confirmed as pathogens of walnut anthracnose through multigene phylogenetic analysis (Da Lio et al. 2018). In Brazil, C. nymphaeae caused walnut anthracnose (Savian et al. 2019). In China, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (Chen 2003; Qu et al. 2011), C. acutatum (Liu et al. 1995), C. fioriniae (Zhu et al. 2015), Colletotrichum siamense (Wang et al. 2017), Colletotrichum fructicola (Wang et al. 2018), and Colletotrichum viniferum (He et al. 2019) were isolated from walnut. The pathogens responsible for walnut anthracnose include not only C. gloeosporioides but also C. fructicola and C. siamense (Wang et al. 2017, 2018) in China. C. fioriniae can infect walnut leaves, exhibiting symptoms similar to anthracnose (Zhu et al. 2015). C. viniferum specifically infected walnut leaves, though the symptoms were not typical (He et al. 2019).
The objectives of this study were: (i) to identify the species of the genus Colletotrichum causing walnut anthracnose using multilocus phylogenetic analyses and morphological characteristics; (ii) to determine the pathogenicity of the isolates obtained from walnut fruits and leaves in China; and (iii) to examine the sensitivity of these isolates to four fungicides (tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim) using in vitro methods.
From 2013 to 2014, walnut fruits and leaves exhibiting anthracnose symptoms were collected from 13 walnut orchards across the provinces of Henan, Hubei, Shaanxi, and Shandong in China. Pure cultures were obtained from diseased walnut fruits and leaves, as well as through single-spore isolation. The collected materials were surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, and segments of healthy and diseased tissues were cut into 3- to 4-mm² pieces. These segments were sterilized with 1% NaOCl for 60 seconds and then with 70% ethanol for 60 seconds, followed by three washes in sterile distilled water. Five segments were placed on potato dextrose agar (PDA; 1.5%, Difco-BD Diagnostics) and incubated at 28°C. After seven days, hyphae were transplanted to PDA plates for sporulation. Monosporic isolates were obtained through serial dilution and stored at 4°C on PDA slants. Most isolates were preserved in the China Forestry Culture Collection Center.
Isolates were cultured on PDA at 28°C for five days. Colony color, conidial masses, and zonation were observed and documented. A drop of sterile water was placed on a glass slide, where three acervuli were added and gently crushed under a cover glass; a few drops of cedar oil were added to minimize evaporation. Appressoria developed on the glass slide surface. Acervuli, conidia, appressoria, conidiophores, and conidiogenous cells were observed under a compound microscope (Nikon Eclipse 50i), with photomicrographs taken using a high-resolution QImaging camera system. The sizes of conidia and appressoria were measured using cellSens standard software (Olympus).
Mycelia, grown for five days on PDA, were dried with sterile filter paper and collected in a sterile centrifuge tube. Mycelial powder was obtained using the trituration method in liquid nitrogen.

It lists isolates by number, including their corresponding orchard locations along with their latitude and longitude coordinates. Additionally, it details the specific walnut varieties and the severity of damage recorded for each sample.
++++: Severe, with incidence greater than 30% (including total losses).
The mycelial powder was dissolved in cetyltrimethylammonium bromide (CTAB) buffer (2% [wt/vol] CTAB, 1.42 M NaCl, 20 mM EDTA, 100 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.0], and 0.2% [wt/vol] β-mercaptoethanol) and then incubated at 65°C for 30 minutes. Genomic DNAs of all isolates were extracted following the method described by Freeman et al. (1996). PCR amplifications were conducted with ribosomal internal transcribed spacer (ITS), actin (ACT), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) genes. Four loci were amplified: the ribosomal DNA region using universal primers ITS1 and ITS4 for ITS (Gardes and Bruns 1993; White et al. 1990), the GAPDH gene using primers GDF-1 and GDR1 (Templeton et al. 1992), the CHS-1 gene using primers CHS-79F and CHS-354R (Carbone and Kohn 1999), and the ACT gene using primers ACT-512F and ACT-783R (Carbone and Kohn 1999). Information about primer sequences, amplicon sizes, and PCR conditions is detailed in Table 3.
Table 2 outlines the strains and sequences of the genus Colletotrichum used in this study, including species names, culture accession numbers, and host plants.
The PCR reaction system had a total volume of 25 µL, consisting of Taq DNA polymerase mix (12.5 µL), forward primer (1.0 µL), reverse primer (1.0 µL), genomic DNA (2.0 µL), and ddH2O (8.5 µL). The PCR amplification procedure included 36 cycles, with details on initial denaturation, denaturation, annealing, extension, and final extension provided in Table 3. After PCR, all amplification products were sequenced by Shanghai Personal Biotechnology Co., Ltd. All sequences have been deposited in GenBank, as listed in Table 2.
All ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences were compared with those of previously described species in the Q-Bank (www.q-bank.eu) using BLAST, and sequences of 46 Colletotrichum isolates were downloaded from GenBank (Table 2). Colletotrichum boninense MAFF 305972 was used as an outgroup, originating from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum. The sequences of each locus were aligned.

Table 2 provides a comprehensive list of various species of the genus Colletotrichum, including their culture accession numbers and the host plants from which they were isolated. Each entry specifies the country of origin and includes corresponding GenBank accession numbers for the ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 genes. The species range from Colletotrichum aenigmay, isolated from Persea americana in Israel, to Colletotrichum boninense, derived from Crinum asiaticum in Japan. This detailed tabulation is essential for understanding the genetic diversity and distribution of Colletotrichum species in relation to their host plants.
Pathogenicity experiments were conducted at the experimental station of the Research Center for the Prevention and Control of Invasive Forest Pests in Shandong Province. Healthy fruits (cultivar Xiangling, aged 1 month) and fully expanded leaves were inoculated in vitro with plugs (5 mm) from isolates cultured for 5 days. A total of thirteen isolates were utilized (refer to Table 2). In total, 280 fruits and 168 leaves were rinsed with running tap water for 60 seconds, surface sterilized with 70% ethanol, and rinsed three times with sterile distilled water. Each fruit and leaf was punctured with a red-hot needle (0.5 mm) on the surface.
For the inoculation, two hyphal plugs were placed on each leaf, while one hyphal plug was used for each fruit; control groups were inoculated with blank agar plugs. Each isolate was tested on 20 fruits and 12 leaves, with additional control samples treated similarly. All treatments and controls were placed in sterile tissue culture bottles (92 mm in diameter, 274 mm in height, 690 ml volume) lined with two layers of wet paper towels to maintain moisture at 28°C under a 12-hour light/dark cycle. Anthracnose symptoms were evaluated seven days post-inoculation, and the fungus was reisolated from symptomatic lesions following the described methodology.
To evaluate virulence, lesion sizes and areas on fruits or leaves were measured on the 10th day after inoculation. The virulence of the isolates was analyzed using a one-way analysis of variance, with means compared using Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test at a 1% significance level, employing IBM SPSS Statistics 20 software.
The in vitro sensitivity of isolates to four fungicides—tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim—was assessed using a mycelium growth rate method. Tebuconazole (97% active ingredient; provided by Jiangsu Changlong Agrochemical Co., Ltd.) and difenoconazole (95.8% active ingredient; provided by Qingdao Hansen Biologic Science Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in acetone. Flusilazole (92% active ingredient) and carbendazim (97.5% active ingredient; provided by Qingdao Hansen Biologic Science Co., Ltd.) were dissolved in cyclohexanone and 1% (wt/wt) hydrochloric acid, respectively. The concentration of all solutions was set at 10,000 mg/ml and stored at 4°C.
Four fungicides were added to autoclaved PDA (potato dextrose agar) cooled to approximately 50°C. PDA media were amended to achieve final concentrations of 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, 2.0, and 4.0 mg/ml active ingredient of tebuconazole, flusilazole, or difenoconazole, and 0.125, 0.25, 0.5, 1.0, and 2.0 mg/ml active ingredient of carbendazim. PDA medium without fungicide served as the control. Approximately 15 ml of PDA medium was transferred to each plate (90 mm in diameter). The isolates were cultured on PDA without fungicides at 28°C for 5 days, and the hyphae were cut into plugs (5 mm in diameter) with a cork borer, which were then placed at the center of the PDA plates.

In major walnut production areas, walnut anthracnose disease primarily damages leaves and fruits. Infected leaves show nearly round or irregular spots that are water-soaked and brown to dark brown. These spots expand along the veins, forming elongated strip lesions. In later stages, older lesions become necrotic and may develop perforations, leading to early defoliation (see Fig. 1A). When fruits are infected, initial symptoms include sub-circular or irregular spots that are water-soaked, sunken, and brown to black (see Fig. 1B). As the disease progresses, some spots enlarge and merge into larger necrotic areas. In these necrotic regions, acervuli can be found in concentric rings, oozing gelatinous pink conidial masses (see Fig. 1C). In severe cases, multiple spots merge and expand to cover the entire fruit (see Fig. 1D), and the pathogen can penetrate the immature endocarp (nut shell). Affected fruits fail to develop normally, leading to premature drop, and the kernels (nut meat) become inedible (see Fig. 1E). The severity of damage to the walnut pericarp aligns closely with the condition of the kernels. Initially, spots are limited to the pericarp, sparing the kernels, which remain unaffected at this stage. However, once the pericarp spot area reaches one-fourth of the whole fruit, the kernels become infected, resulting in reduced quality and quantity (see Fig. 2).
The incidence of walnut anthracnose varied across 13 orchards, with the highest rates observed in orchards 2 and 3, where the walnut variety was Xiangling (see Table 1). A total of 59 isolates were collected from diseased fruits and leaves. In orchard 7, isolates of the genera Colletotrichum and Fusarium were identified. The genera Colletotrichum and Alternaria were found in orchards 4, 6, and 8, while Colletotrichum and Xanthomonas were identified in orchards 10 and 11. One Colletotrichum isolate was selected to represent each orchard (as detailed in Table 1), and 13 isolates were preserved for further study.
On potato dextrose agar (PDA), the aerial mycelium was dense and cottony, with colonies appearing milky, pale gray, to medium gray toward the center. The reverse sides of the colonies were gray, olivaceous gray, or blue-gray at the center, often featuring sporadic dark gray flecks at the edges (see Fig. 3A to C). The colonies had entire margins, and orange conidial masses were visible in acervuli. Sexual morphs were absent, while asexual morphs were present on PDA. Hyphae were hyaline to medium brown, smooth, septate, and branched. Acervuli were observed (see Fig. 3D), but setae were not detected. Conidiophores were hyaline, smooth-walled, and occasionally branched. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, smooth, and cylindrical, often with a septum (see Fig. 3G and H). Conidia were straight, mostly cylindrical, and broadly rounded at the ends, with a length-to-width ratio of approximately 1.3. Consequently, the isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides.
The size of the isolates ranged from 5.2 to 8.9 mm, with most measuring between 6.7 and 7.6 mm. In comparison, the sequences of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto ranged from 2.7 to 7.1 mm (mean = 5.4 ± 1.0, n = 26). The similarity of the ITS sequences was between 99.3% and 100%. All isolates showed CHS-1 sequences with a similarity of 99.2% to 100%. The GAPDH similarity ranged from 89.9% to 98.6%. The ACT sequences from isolates SL-30, LZ-02, SQ-141, ZZ-27, YT-172, SL-31, HB-49, SL-37, SL-34, SMX-42H, and ZQ-29 exhibited similarities of 100% and 99.6% with C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates ICMP 17821 and ICMP 12939, respectively (see Supplementary Table S1).
To compare sequences with 46 isolates downloaded from GenBank, ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 sequences of all isolates were concatenated using the Fasta alignment joiner software. The aligned sequences were 98.0% to 99.5% homologous to the ex-type C. gloeosporioides s.s. ICMP 17821. Multilocus phylogenetic trees were constructed using neighbor-joining and maximum parsimony methods. The final dataset consisted of 1,061 sites, including 715 conserved sites, 312 variable sites, 163 parsimony informative sites, and 140 singleton sites. In the maximum parsimony phylogenetic tree, the tree length was 465, with a consistency index of 0.56 and a retention index of 0.84. Composite indices were 0.57 for all sites and 0.47 for parsimony-informative sites. The tested isolates clustered with C. gloeosporioides s.s. with 98% bootstrap support (Fig. 4). In the neighbor-joining phylogenetic tree, the total branch length was 0.57, and all 13 studied isolates clustered with C. gloeosporioides s.s., including its ex-type, with 100% bootstrap support (see Supplementary Fig. S1).
The multilocus phylogenetic analyses of the four genes, combined with morphological characteristics (including colony features, conidia, appressoria, conidiophores, and conidiogenous cells), confirmed that all isolates were C. gloeosporioides s.s.
Regarding pathogenicity and virulence to leaves and fruits, walnut fruits and leaves were inoculated with the 13 isolates. Infections occurred at the inoculation sites on both leaves and fruits (see Supplementary Fig. S2A to M), presenting symptoms similar to those of anthracnose observed in the field (Fig. 1). Control fruits and leaves showed no symptoms seven days after inoculation with blank agar plugs (see Supplementary Fig. S2N). Typical symptoms included roughly circular or irregular spots, with infections appearing water-soaked, sunken, and brown to black. The black lesions expanded and developed into necrotic areas. The fungus was reisolated from these lesions using the previously mentioned methods. Koch's postulates were fulfilled, confirming that all 13 isolates were indeed the walnut anthracnose pathogen.
The disease lesions on leaves and fruits inoculated with the same isolate showed considerable differences. The 13 isolates were divided into three groups by comparing their virulence to walnut leaves and fruits. In Group 1, the virulence to walnut fruits was higher than that to leaves, with nine isolates (69.2%) classified in this group. In Group 2, there was no difference in pathogenicity, which included isolates LZ-02 and ZQ-29. Group 3 consisted of isolates where virulence to walnut leaves was higher, specifically isolates ZZ-01 and HB-49.
Figure 5 illustrates the results of inoculations with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.): it shows the mean fruit lesion size (in centimeters) and the leaf lesion area (in square centimeters) caused by the C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates associated with walnut anthracnose. The bars above the columns represent the standard errors. Bars that share the same pattern and letter (symbols) indicate no significant differences according to Tukey's honestly significant difference (HSD) test (P < 0.01).
In vitro sensitivity of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to four fungicides revealed that all four fungicides inhibited fungal mycelium growth. The EC50 values for tebuconazole, difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim were 6.5–6.9, 1.5–0.6, 0.9–0.4, and 0.1–0.05 mg/ml, respectively (Table 4). C. gloeosporioides s.s. was more sensitive to difenoconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim than to tebuconazole (P < 0.01). The toxicities of carbendazim, flusilazole, and difenoconazole to C. gloeosporioides s.s. were not significantly different (P < 0.01).
The results confirmed that the resistance ratios of all isolates to the four fungicides varied (Figure 6). Sensitivities to carbendazim and tebuconazole showed significant differences among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.33; isolate HB-49 was the most sensitive, while isolate SL-31 was the least sensitive to carbendazim. The resistance ratios to tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.59, with isolate SL-31 being the most sensitive and isolate TS-09 being the least sensitive. The sensitivities to difenoconazole and flusilazole were largely consistent across all isolates, with resistance ratios ranging from 1 to 4.55 and 7, respectively.
There was a significant difference in the resistance ratio to carbendazim among the isolates, suggesting that difenoconazole and flusilazole could be effective for disease control.
Identification results were problematic (Than et al. 2008; Weir et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2009). Proper identification of the pathogen is the basis for developing effective management strategies. Therefore, it is very important to accurately distinguish between the species. In this paper, we confirm that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) is one of the species of the genus Colletotrichum responsible for walnut anthracnose in China.
Several Colletotrichum species have been associated with walnut anthracnose, including C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. fioriniae, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (s.l.) (Da Lio et al. 2018; Savian et al. 2019; Wang et al. 2017, 2018; Zhu et al. 2015). It is safe to state that walnut anthracnose is a complex disease. With an increasing number of walnut anthracnose samples collected from more walnut orchards across wider geographic areas in China, it is possible that more Colletotrichum species or new species responsible for walnut anthracnose will be identified or described. Da Lio et al. (2018) obtained C. fioriniae and C. godetiae from nuts and buds in the same orchard, and both caused walnut anthracnose. Multiple Colletotrichum species can occur in the same orchard and from different walnut isolation sites. Whether multiple species may occur in the same walnut tissues remains unclear, and additional studies are necessary in the future. Further research is needed on infection timing, independent or collaborative infection of walnuts, and the disease occurrence patterns of C. siamense, C. fructicola, and C. gloeosporioides s.s.
This table presents the toxicity data of four fungicides against Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto. It includes the median effective concentration (EC50) values measured in mg/ml and the corresponding 95% confidence intervals (CI). The fungicides tested are Tebuconazole, Difenoconazole, Flusilazole, and Carbendazim. Tebuconazole showed an EC50 value ranging between 6.5 and 6.9 mg/ml, while Difenoconazole had a lower value between 1.5 and 0.6 mg/ml. Flusilazole had an EC50 value ranging from 0.9 to 0.4 mg/ml, and Carbendazim demonstrated the lowest toxicity with an EC50 value between 0.1 and 0.05 mg/ml. The table also notes that means sharing a common letter in the same column are not significantly different according to Tukey's Honestly Significant Difference (HSD) test (P < 0.01).
This table outlines the primers utilized in the study, including their sequences, amplicon sizes, sources, and PCR conditions. Each primer is listed along with its specific gene target, including ITS (internal transcribed spacer), ACT (actin), GAPDH (glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase), and CHS-1 (chitin synthase). The initial denaturation conditions and annealing temperatures for PCR amplification are provided, along with references for the sources of these primers.
For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.
In conclusion, the 13 isolates from the orchards were identified as C. gloeosporioides s.s. All isolates were confirmed to be the pathogen responsible for walnut anthracnose in China. The isolates from different geographic regions exhibited differences in virulence and fungicide sensitivities. The results preliminarily indicated a high level of intraspecific diversity among the populations of C. gloeosporioides s.s. This study provides crucial information for managing this disease in China. For example, targeted control strategies should be implemented according to different geographic regions to reduce losses caused by C. gloeosporioides s.s.
