Twenty strains representing eight species of Colletotrichum were isolated from lesions of various amaryllid species (monocotyledons, Amaryllidaceae) in Yunnan, Guangxi, and Guizhou Provinces in China, as well as Chiang Rai Province in Thailand. These strains were characterized through morphological studies and phylogenetic analyses based on actin, β-tubulin (tub 2), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase A (CHS I), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GPDH), and the rDNA internal transcribed spacer (ITS) gene sequence data. Three new species, Colletotrichum cliviae, C. hippeastri, and C. hymenocallidis, are described and illustrated in this paper based on morphological characters and multi-gene sequence data. Pathogenicity testing indicated that these new taxa from Amaryllidaceae are not host-specific.
Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, causing disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum, each with a brief description. In recent years, molecular tools have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Some species have been segregated from the C. gloeosporioides complex based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, such as C. boninense.
Amaryllids, members of the Amaryllidaceae family, are bulbous herbs characterized by distichous or, rarely, rosulate leaves and a lateral, solid, naked scape. This scape is terminated by an umbel-like cluster of showy flowers (Meerow et al., 1998). Several amaryllids hold economic value as medicinal plants, and species or hybrids of Nerine, Amaryllis, and Crinum are cultivated in various countries for their elegant flowers (Dahlgren et al., 1985). Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose on Amaryllidaceae have been reported in Japan (Horie et al., 1990; Moriwaki et al., 2003) and China (Liu et al., 2000). The disease manifests as depressed reddish-brown lesions on leaves or scapes, which limits the commercial production of ornamental and medicinal plants (Liu et al., 2000). The species Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib., C. crassipes (Speg.) Arx, C. dematium (Pers.) Grove, and C. capsici (Syd.) E.J. Butler & Bisby have been reported to infect Amaryllis sp., Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum, and Clivia miniata (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003; http://194.203.77.76/herbIMI/Name.asp).
In this study, we used a combination of morphological and molecular characteristics to identify and characterize Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in China and Thailand.
Colletotrichum samples were collected from anthracnose lesions on Clivia, Crinum, Hippeastrum, and Hymenocallis (Amaryllidaceae) in Guangxi, Guizhou, and Yunnan provinces in China, as well as Chiang Rai Province in Thailand, from June 2008 to September 2009. Isolation was carried out using two methods, depending on the presence of fungal sporulation. Isolates from lesions without visible sporulation were obtained using the procedure described by Photita et al. (2005). For lesions with sporulation, single-spore isolations were performed following the method described by Choi et al. (1999). Spore masses were collected with a sterilized wire loop and streaked onto the surface of water agar (WA) plates, which were then incubated overnight. A single germinated spore was picked up with a sterilized needle and transferred onto potato dextrose agar (PDA). Pure cultures were stored at 4°C on PDA slants. Isolates were deposited in the Guizhou Academy of Agricultural Sciences, China, and in the Mae Fah Luang University (MFLU) Culture Collection and the National Centre for Genetic Engineering and Biotechnology (BIOTEC) in Thailand.
Starter cultures were prepared by plating each isolate onto PDA at 25°C. Five 4 mm plugs were aseptically cut from actively sporulating areas near the growing edge of a 5-day-old culture of each isolate using a sterile cork borer. Each plug was placed onto PDA plates (90 × 15 mm Petri dishes) and grown in an alternating light cycle of 12 hours near UV and 12 hours of darkness at 25ºC (Sutton, 1980). Colony diameters were measured on day six (or day four for the fastest-growing cultures). Growth rates were calculated as the average daily growth over six or four days (mm per day). After 7-10 days, the size and shape of 50 conidia harvested from culture were assessed. The color of the conidial masses and any zonation patterns were recorded at day seven. Mycelial appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique (Sutton, 1980).
DNA was extracted from all isolates growing on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at room temperature for 8-10 days, using a modified protocol from Chen et al. (2007). The gene regions were amplified using primers listed in Table 1. PCR amplifications were performed in a 25 µl mixture containing 9.5 µl ddH₂O, 12.5 µl of 2×PCR Master Mix (TIANGEN Co., China), 1 µl of DNA template, and 1 µl of each primer (10 µM). The reactions were conducted with a thermal cycler (Mycycler™, Bio-Rad, Hercules, CA, USA) using the following thermal program: 94°C for 5 min, followed by 35 cycles of denaturation (94°C for 30 s), annealing (30 s at 59°C for Actin, CAL, and β-tubulin; 56°C for GPDH and CHS I; and 53°C for ITS), elongation (72°C for 90 s), and a final extension of 7 min at 72°C. PCR products were examined by electrophoresis, stained with ethidium bromide, and purified according to the manufacturer's instructions for the TIANGEN Mini Purification Kit (TIANGEN Co., China). Purified samples were sequenced using the aforementioned PCR primers on an Applied Biosystems 3730xl DNA Analyzer at Sino-max Co., China. Two gene amplicons, CAL and β-tubulin, were cloned into DH5α (TIANGEN Co., China) using the pMD18-T vector (Takara) and sequenced at the same company.
Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using six gene regions, with accession numbers of all sequences listed in Table 3. Multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalX 2.0.10 (Larkin et al., 2007), treating gaps as missing data. Each of the single and combined sequence alignments was analyzed using maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP* 4b10. Ambiguously aligned regions were excluded from all analyses. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. The maximum number of trees was unlimited; branches of zero length were collapsed, and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics, such as tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI), were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. Clade stability of the trees resulting from the parsimony analyses was assessed through bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Trees were visualized in Treeview. When analyzing ITS and β-tubulin sequences, some reference sequences were obtained from GenBank (Table 2). The model of evolution was estimated using MrModelTest 2.2 (Nylander, 2004). Posterior probabilities (PP) were determined using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC) in MrBayes 3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001). Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 3,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100 generations, resulting in 30,000 total trees. The first 2,000 trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining 28,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree.
A representative isolate of each species from Amaryllidaceae was selected for pathogenicity testing (Table 6). For testing the host range, 12 plant species were selected from 6 families (Table 6), most of which are hosts of Colletotrichum species morphologically similar to our isolates from Amaryllidaceae. Single spore cultures of each isolate were prepared.
Table 1 lists the primers used for PCR amplification and DNA sequencing, specifically identifying the targets for each primer set. It includes various gene regions such as ITS, Actin, CAL, CHS I, GPDH, and β-tubulin, along with their respective primer sequences. Each row provides a primer designation, including both forward and reverse primers where applicable, facilitating the amplification of the corresponding DNA regions for subsequent analysis.
White et al. (1990), Carbone and Kohn (1999), Johnston (pers. comm.), Carbone et al. (1999), Guerber et al. (2003), Templeton et al. (1992), O'Donnell and Cigelnik (1997), and Glass and Donaldson (1995) reported that samples were grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA) for 7 days at 25°C. Spores were harvested by adding 10 ml of sterilized water, with the concentration adjusted to 10^6 conidia/ml using a hemocytometer. This conidial suspension was then used as the standard inoculum for pathogenicity and host range testing. The suspension was filtered through two layers of muslin cloth (Than et al., 2008a).
Healthy leaves or fruits were collected, washed with tap water, and disinfected in 1% sodium hypochlorite for 5-7 minutes; the disinfection time was adjusted based on the surface texture (smooth or coarse). After disinfection, the leaves and fruits were washed three times with distilled, sterilized water and dried using sterilized filter paper. Each leaf or fruit was placed individually in a 12 cm diameter Petri dish or tissue culture bottle (for tomato and grapefruit) with a 1 cm diameter cotton swab soaked in distilled water to maintain humidity.
The inoculation method described by Than et al. (2008a) involved a wound/drop inoculation technique, where a pin was used to prick the leaf or fruit wall to a depth of 1 mm, and then 6 µl of conidia suspension (10^6 conidia/ml) was placed onto the wound or non-wound areas. Control samples were inoculated with 6 µl of sterilized distilled water. Each plant was inoculated with four replicates per selected strain. The inoculated fruits and leaves were incubated at 25°C for 24 hours, followed by incubation at room temperature (22-27°C). After 6-7 days and 14-15 days of incubation, leaves and fruits were examined for lesions using a stereo-microscope on a superclean bench. Spore masses or acervuli on the leaves or fruits were observed with a compound microscope. Spores were transferred to PDA medium and distilled water, which was then gently swirled to dislodge the conidia before being incubated at 25°C to check for colony and spore characteristics. All infected leaves or fruits were sterilized and disposed of.
The Colletotrichum isolates used in this study are listed in Table 3. A total of twenty strains of Colletotrichum were isolated from anthracnose associated with Clivia, Crinum, Hippeastrum, and Hymenocallis (Amaryllidaceae). Morphological examination classified these twenty isolates into six morphogroups, while analysis of the ITS sequence revealed eight phylogenetic lineages (details provided below). For comparison, reference strains of several important Colletotrichum species were included, such as Colletotrichum simmondsii R.G. Shivas & Y.P. Tan (holotype, BRIP 28519), C. truncatum (Schwein.) Andrus & W.D. Moore (CBS 120709), C. coccodes (Wallr.) S. Hughes (CPOS1), C. gloeosporioides (epitype, CBS 953.97), and C. trichellum (Fr.) Duke (HKUCC 10378).
The ITS dataset comprised 570 characters after alignment, of which 138 characters were parsimony informative (24.2%). The Kishino-Hasegawa (KH) test indicated that the 556 trees generated from parsimony analysis were not significantly different. One of the most parsimonious trees (TL = 549, CI = 0.692, RI = 0.867, RC = 0.600, HI = 0.308) is shown in Fig. 1. The dataset from the combined six genes comprised 2,973 characters after alignment.
Table 2 includes the ITS and β-tubulin sequences obtained from GenBank for analysis, detailing various Colletotrichum species. It lists the anamorph and teleomorph names, along with their corresponding GenBank accession numbers. Specific strains such as Colletotrichum agaves and others are represented, showcasing a range of sequence data necessary for the study. This table is crucial for understanding the genetic diversity and classification of the isolated strains in relation to known references.
This section lists ITS and β-tubulin sequences obtained from GenBank for analysis.
Table 3 summarizes isolates of Colletotrichum used in this study, detailing their GeneBank numbers and associated hosts. The table includes various isolates such as Colletotrichum cliviae, with specific GeneBank numbers like GQ485607 for one isolate, indicating its genetic sequence. Each entry lists the respective host plant (e.g., Clivia miniata, Crinum asiaticum) and the geographic origin (e.g., Kunming, Yunnan, China; Coimbatore, India). The table serves to correlate genetic data with specific plant hosts and their locations, enhancing our understanding of the diversity and distribution of Colletotrichum species.

The table presents tree statistics for various gene sequences, including Actin, CAL, GPDH, CHS I, tub2, and ITS, analyzed using PAUP. It details the number of included parsimony informative characters (NPIC), the total number of characters, character length, and additional statistical metrics. The NPIC values range from 59 to 162 across the different genes, indicating variability in their phylogenetic informativeness. The total number of characters varies significantly as well, with some sequences having over 900 characters. The percentages of parsimony informative characters relative to the total character count are provided, showing the proportion of informative characters for each gene. Notably, the analysis reveals a total of 1,081 parsimony informative characters out of 2,973 total characters, resulting in a percentage of 36.3%.
The phylogenetic analysis indicated that the trees inferred from these sequences did not show significant differences according to KH testing. Phylograms derived from the dataset of the combined six gene regions are illustrated in Fig. 2, while individual gene analyses for Actin, CHS I, β-tubulin, CAL, and GPDH exhibited similar topologies to those derived from the ITS and combined datasets.
The isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose on Amaryllidaceae clustered into eight distinct clades based on phylogenetic analysis of the ITS region (Fig. 1). Clade 1 was monophyletic with high bootstrap support (97%) and included isolates CSSX3, CSSX5, and CSSX10, which correspond to Colletotrichum spaethianum (Allescher) Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous. Clade 2, also monophyletic with 100% bootstrap support, included isolates CSSK4, CSSS1, and CSSS2, which formed a sister relationship with Colletotrichum orbiculare (Berk. & Mont.) Arx. Clade 3, supported by 96% bootstrap values, comprised isolates CSSG1 and CSSG2, which were basal to Colletotrichum boninense. Clade 4 contained isolates CSSN1 and CSSX8, clustered with two strains of Colletotrichum boninense from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum, achieving 92% bootstrap support. Clade 5 included five distinct strains (CSSX2, CSSX4, CSSX9, CSST3, and CSST5) with 100% bootstrap support, alongside two strains of Colletotrichum truncatum.
Phylograms inferred from CAL gene sequences grouped isolate CSSX7 alongside C. fructicola (strain BPD-I16, holotype) in a distinct lineage (clade 7), supported by 96% bootstrap. In contrast, phylograms inferred from CHS I exhibited strong similarity to those from ITS for clades 1–6. These phylograms also indicated that isolates CSSN2 and CSSN3 formed a separate lineage (clade 8) with 67% bootstrap support. Notably, the bootstrap support for clade 6 (comprising CSST1 and CSST4) was higher than that inferred from ITS, at 89% versus 58%. The position of isolate CSSX7 was unresolved in this single-gene tree (trees not shown).
Phylograms derived from combined datasets of Actin, β-tubulin, CHS I, CAL, GPDH, and the ITS regions confirmed the existence of eight well-defined clades (Fig. 2), representing eight distinct species. Clades 1 to 6 aligned with phylograms constructed using ITS and CHS I. The bootstrap and Bayesian posterior probabilities for the six clades were notably high, equal to or exceeding 98%. Isolate CSSX7 was positioned in a distinct clade (clade 7) with 100% bootstrap support. Additionally, isolates CSSN2 and CSSN3 formed another distinct clade (clade 8) with 95% bootstrap support and 100% Bayesian posterior probabilities (Fig. 2).
Clades 1, 4, 5, and 6 correspond to Colletotrichum spaethianum, C. boninense, C. truncatum, and C. siamense, respectively. The phylograms also indicated that isolate CSSX2 belonged to clade 2, identified as C. truncatum, while CSSS2 was recognized as C. cliviae. The analysis included C. gloeosporioides CBS 953.97 (epitype), C. spaethianum CPOS1 isolated from potato, and other relevant species.
Figure 1 displays maximum parsimony phylograms inferred from ITS sequence data, illustrating the phylogenetic relationships among Colletotrichum isolates from Amaryllidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, Thailand (noted in bold), along with selected sequences from various Colletotrichum species, some of which are epitypes. The data were analyzed using random addition sequences and unweighted parsimony, treating gaps as missing data. The tree is rooted with Fusarium oxysporum (ATCC MYA-3790), and values above the branches represent parsimony bootstrap support (50% or higher).
C. fructicola, respectively. Clades 2, 3, and 8 represent three undescribed species of Colletotrichum. Full descriptions and illustrations of these three species are provided in the taxonomy section and are listed in Tables 3 and 5. Three of these species are clearly different from all currently known species of Colletotrichum (Hyde et al., 2009; Sutton, 1992) and are therefore described and illustrated as new species.
Colletotrichum boninense Moriwaki, Toy. Sato & Tsukib. This species occurs on the leaves of Crinum asiaticum, presenting as reddish-brown, ellipsoid to irregular spots and forming pink conidial masses with rare setae (Fig. 6A). In this study, although the conidia of C. boninense (CSSN1 and CSSX8) are wider than those of the holotype and paratype, their shape and cultural characteristics are similar, and they cluster in one clade with high bootstrap support (there is one base difference in the ITS sequence among them and the holotype). Additionally, the holotype and paratype of C. boninense were collected from Crinum asiaticum var. sinicum in Japan.

Description: Leaf lesions are elliptical or circular, reddish-brown (Fig. 6E). On the host, acervuli are subepidermal, disrupting the outer epidermal cell wall, with no setae present, and salmon-pink conidia masses (Fig. 5A). Conidiophores are hyaline, 1-2 celled, not branching or branching at the base, measuring 9-20 × 3-4.5 µm (x = 14.7 ± 3.1 × 3.8 ± 0.5, n = 20) (Fig. 5D). Conidia are 9.5-15 × 3.5-5.5 µm (x = 13.1 ± 1.4 × 4.8 ± 0.4, n = 50), one-celled, smooth-walled, hyaline, straight, occasionally slightly curved, fusiform, and gradually tapered at the ends (Figs. 5E, F). Colonies on PDA reach 6-6.4 cm in diameter (x = 6.2 ± 4.4, n = 10) in 6 days at 25°C, with a growth rate of 8.8-11 mm per day (x = 9.9 ± 0.8, n = 10). Initially white, they become pale grey with concentric zones as they age, dense, with a pale white reverse that becomes greenish-black from the center with age, and a white margin (Figs. 5B, C). Sclerotia and setae are absent. Conidia are formed in orange-pink conidial masses, measuring 14-20 × 5-6.5 µm (x = 15.9 ± 1.1 × 5.1 ± 0.40, n = 100), one-celled, smooth-walled, hyaline, fusiform, straight, guttulate, occasionally constricted at the center, and obtuse at the ends (Figs. 5G-I). Appressoria are dark brown, ovate, irregular, with entire margins or crenate to lobed, occasionally forming secondary appressoria from the first but not complex (Figs. 5J-L), measuring 7-11 × 5-7.5 µm (x = 8.5 ± 0.9 × 6.6 ± 0.6, n = 40).

Pathogenicity testing and host range: The three new species are not host-specific (Table 6). Isolate CSSN2 (Colletotrichum hymenocallidis) from Hymenocallis americana can infect fruits of Capsicum annuum and Lycopersicon esculentum by wound/drop inoculation, forming salmon-pink conidial masses without setae. Both non-wound/drop and wound/drop inoculation resulted in leaf infection of Hymenocallis americana, exhibiting symptoms similar to those seen in the field.
Isolate CSSG1 (Colletotrichum hippeastri) from Hippeastrum vittatum caused disease on the leaves of Crinum asiaticum via wound/drop inoculation, resulting in reddish-brown spots with acervuli and few setae on the leaves. Isolate CSSK4 (Colletotrichum cliviae) can infect Bletilla striata through wound/drop inoculation, resulting in numerous pale yellow conidial masses on the leaves. Additionally, CSSK4 can infect Crinum asiaticum by both non-wound/drop and wound/drop inoculation, causing symptoms similar to those in the field.
The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, Thailand, based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data. A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...

Molecular identities at the ITS, GPDH, β-tubulin, CAL, Actin, and CHS I loci have been studied for the species of Colletotrichum on Amaryllidaceae. Previously recorded species include Colletotrichum boninense (MAFF 3060 94, CBS 119185, CBS 241.78), C. capsici (IMI 233426; synonymy with C. truncatum), C. crassipes (IMI 165604, IMI 304052, IMI 259839), and C. dematium (IMI 208403, IMI 124329) associated with anthracnose in Amaryllidaceae. Notably, C. boninense has been documented as the causal agent of anthracnose on Dracaena sanderiana and Euonymus japonica, as well as an endophyte in various hosts worldwide. Recent research suggests that C. boninense may represent a species complex.
Both C. capsici and C. dematium are known to affect a variety of host plants across tropical and temperate regions. In this study, however, C. dematium and C. crassipes were not encountered. Six additional taxa, including Colletotrichum cliviae, C. fructicola, C. hippeastri, C. hymenocallidis, C. siamense, and C. spaethianum, were recorded for the first time as causes of anthracnose in Amaryllidaceae.
Table 7 summarizes the morphological characteristics of Colletotrichum hippeastri and similar taxa. The characteristics include colony color, conidial shape and size, appressorium features, and growth rates.
Colletotrichum dracaenophilum exhibits pale pink colonies with broad clavate to cylindrical conidia.
Colletotrichum hippeastri shows a variety of colony colors from pale white to black, with cylindrical conidia that can become complex.
Colletotrichum nupharicola has flattened, wet colonies with cylindrical to clavate conidia.
Colletotrichum sansevieriae features greyish-white colonies with straight, cylindrical conidia.
Growth rates and incubation details vary among the taxa, reflecting their diverse environmental adaptations.
In conclusion, the justification for the identification of Colletotrichum cliviae is supported by these morphological and molecular analyses, enhancing our understanding of the Colletotrichum species associated with Amaryllidaceae.
Colletotrichum cliviae exhibits a higher growth rate than C. orbiculare and C. boninense, with growth rates of 15.2-16 mm/day for C. cliviae compared to 10.4-12.2 mm/day for C. boninense and 5.1-5.3 mm/day for C. orbiculare (Sutton, 1980; Moriwaki et al., 2003; Asakura et al., 2009). In the phylogram derived from single and combined multi-gene datasets, three isolates of C. cliviae clustered together, phylogenetically distinct from other morphologically similar species (Figs. 1, 2).
Colletotrichum hippeastri: The conidia of Colletotrichum hippeastri overlap in size with those of C. dracaenophilum D.F. Farr & M.E. Palm, C. sansevieriae M. Nakamura & M. Ohzono, and C. nupharicola D.A. Johnson, Carris & J.D. Rogers (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2006). However, C. hippeastri differs in several other characteristics. The conidia of C. hippeastri are typically narrower at each end or in the center, unlike those of C. dracaenophilum and C. nupharicola, which do not exhibit narrowing (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006). Germinating conidia of C. hippeastri can form 2-4 cells (Fig. 4), a feature that distinguishes it from other Colletotrichum species. The conidia of C. nupharicola become 2-celled, and secondary conidia form from germ tubes (Johnson et al., 1997). The appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. nupharicola (10.5-17.5 × 8-12.5 µm vs. 6-10 × 7-9 µm) and are irregular, crenate, or lobed (Figs. 4H, I, K-N), whereas those of C. nupharicola are ovoid to clavate. Additionally, the conidia of C. hippeastri are longer than those of C. sansevieriae (mean 29.2 × 8.8 µm vs. 18.4 × 6.4 µm). C. sansevieriae is also highly host-specific to Sansevieria (Nakamura et al., 2006). Colonies of C. hippeastri grow faster than those of C. dracaenophilum, C. sansevieriae, or C. nupharicola, and exhibit other distinct colony characteristics (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2006). Due to the very short ITS sequence of C. sansevieriae (159 base pairs in GenBank), these sequences were not included in our ITS phylogenetic analysis. The ITS2 sequences of C. hippeastri and C. sansevieriae (AB212991, strain: Sa-1-2; MAFF239721, ex-holotype) display nineteen base differences. Ultimately, C. hippeastri clusters separately from C. dracaenophilum in phylograms inferred from ITS sequences (Fig. 1).
Colletotrichum hymenocallidis: The size and shape of conidia in Colletotrichum hymenocallidis are similar to those of C. siamense; however, their colony characteristics differ. The reverse of C. siamense is yellowish-white, while that of C. hymenocallidis is greenish-black. The conidial and mycelial appressoria in C. hymenocallidis are larger than those in C. siamense (Prihastuti et al., 2009). Based on phylograms derived from CHS I and combined datasets of six genes, these species occur in two distinct clades (Fig. 2). Although the size and shape of conidia in C. gloeosporioides are similar to those of C. hymenocallidis, the latter grows slower under the same conditions (10 mm/day for C. hymenocallidis compared to 26.5 mm/day for C. gloeosporioides) (Cannon et al., 2008). In both single and combined gene trees, C. hymenocallidis formed a distinct lineage separate from C. gloeosporioides (Figs. 1, 2).
With the exception of the three new species, five other species identified in this study have been previously reported from several other hosts (Sutton, 1980; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Moriwaki et al., 2003; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009; Phoulivong et al., pers. comm.). Therefore, we selected the three new species for pathogenicity testing in vitro against 12 plants belonging to 6 families. The results indicated that C. cliviae, C. hippeastri, and C. hymenocallidis are not host-specific, as they can infect two or three different hosts.
The virulence potential of Colletotrichum species depends on the interplay of various factors such as plant varieties, humidity, temperature, and the concentration of inoculum (Simmonds, 1965; Freeman et al., 1998). Thus, the pathogenicity and virulence of these new species require testing in vivo. The Amaryllidaceae comprises 51 genera with over 800 species and has a worldwide distribution (Meerow et al., 1998, 2000). A high diversity of Colletotrichum species, including many undocumented new species, can be expected if more hosts are studied.
