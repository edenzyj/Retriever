Freeman, S., and Katan, T. 1997. Identification of Colletotrichum species responsible for anthracnose and root necrosis of strawberry in Israel. Phytopathology 87:516-521.
Strawberry anthracnose was first observed in Israel in 1995, reaching epidemic proportions in nurseries and production fields during 1995 and 1996. Using morphological and cultural characteristics, the species responsible for anthracnose was identified as Colletotrichum acutatum. A reliable semi-selective medium, amended with iprodione and lactic acid, was used to isolate the fungus from infected tissues. Additionally, C. acutatum was isolated from necrotic roots of stunted, chlorotic plants that exhibited no visible symptoms of anthracnose. High levels of the pathogen were quantified from naturally infested field soil and perlite growth substrates in the rhizosphere of diseased plants on the iprodione-amended medium.
Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.
From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.

Colletotrichum species were isolated from necrotic root tissues, although no foliar anthracnose was observed.
Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.
Strawberry anthracnose reached epidemic proportions in Israel during the 1995 to 1996 and the subsequent 1996 to 1997 growing seasons. Concurrently, plants exhibiting stunting, chlorosis, and root necrosis were observed in many production fields. The primary aim of this study was to characterize the species of Colletotrichum responsible for these symptoms and to determine whether anthracnose and root necrosis are caused by the same pathogen or different species. We characterized 147 isolates of Colletotrichum from both typical diseased plants and atypical stunted, chlorotic plants with root necrosis. Vegetative compatibility tests with nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutants were employed to study the genetic composition of the pathogen population. PCR was used to compare the isolates with each other and with reference strains of the three Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries.
Fungal Cultures and Growth Conditions: The monoconidial Colletotrichum isolates used in this study are detailed in Table 1. Reference isolates include C. acutatum (CA-310-1 and CA-330-1), C. fragariae (CF-63-1), and two discrete genotypes of C. gloeosporioides (CG-315-1 representing genotype Cgl-1, and CG-272-1 of genotype Cgl-2), which were previously identified and characterized. All Israeli cultures were isolated from symptomatic, infected strawberry plants (fruit, vegetative parts, and roots) from various cultivars, sites, and plots during the 1995 to 1996 season. Infected plant parts were surface-disinfested with 3% sodium hypochlorite and plated on modified Mathur’s medium (MS) composed of 0.1% yeast extract, 0.1% bactopeptone, 1% sucrose, 0.25% MgSO4·7H2O, 0.27% KH2PO4, and 2% agar, supplemented with 2.5 µg (a.i.) of iprodione (Rovral 50WP) per ml and acidified with 0.1% lactic acid to suppress fungal contaminants and bacteria. Cultures were grown on MS at 25°C in the dark and characterized morphologically. They were also transferred to potato dextrose agar (PDA) to confirm their identification.
Eighty diseased plants (twenty from each of the three fields and twenty from the perlite substrate) were assessed for the presence of pathogens in their roots. Five necrotic root segments, each 1.5 cm long, were randomly chosen from each plant, surface-disinfested, and plated on supplemented MS media. The plates were incubated at 25°C for 5 to 7 days, and segments that yielded colonies of Colletotrichum were counted. Results were expressed as the percentage of infected roots from plants growing in soil and perlite.
The table presents the origin and characteristics of various Colletotrichum isolates used in the study, including species, isolate identifiers, geographic origin (state or country), site/plot information, cultivar details, molecular analysis results, vegetative compatibility grouping (VCG), and pathogenicity assays. For example, C. fragariae isolate CF-63-1 is from Mississippi, U.S., while C. gloeosporioides isolate CG-272-1 originates from Florida, U.S. The table details each isolate's specific host tissue, such as crown, leaf, fruit, or root, and indicates which isolates were tested positive for molecular analysis, VCG, and pathogenicity. This comprehensive overview aids in understanding the diversity and pathogenic potential of the isolates.
Plant roots of Chandler and Sharon cultivars were inoculated by dipping them in conidial suspensions (10^6/ml) of two fruit isolates (TUT-106A and TUT-110A) and two root isolates (TUT-127A and TUT-137A) for 10 minutes, 4 hours, and 18 hours. The plants were then transferred to pots (15 cm diameter) filled with a peat/tuff (volcanic ash) medium at a 1:1 volume ratio. Ten plants of each cultivar were inoculated with each isolate separately, alongside comparable water controls. The plants were maintained in the greenhouse under conditions identical to those used for the foliar inoculations. The percentage of plant mortality was determined 21 days after inoculation for each treatment, and the percentage of infected roots was calculated as previously described. The experiment was conducted three times consecutively over a 3-week period, dictated by the availability of plants for inoculation, and results from the three experiments were pooled. Statistical analysis of plant mortality following root inoculation with different isolates and dipping periods was performed using a two-way analysis of variance, with the SAS statistical program (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
For vegetative compatibility grouping, Puhalla’s minimal nitrate agar (MM), a sucrose-salt medium containing nitrate as the nitrogen source, was utilized to identify nit mutants and for complementation (heterokaryon) tests. Chlorate media, based on MM or PDA amended with KClO3 (15 or 25 g/liter, respectively), were employed to generate nit mutants. Plates (9 cm diameter) of chlorate media were centrally inoculated with small mycelial plugs and incubated at 24 to 27°C. Fast-growing sectors emerging from the restricted colonies were transferred to MM plates (5 cm diameter) and examined after a 4-day incubation period. Colonies exhibiting thin expanding mycelium were considered nit mutants. Partial phenotype characterization of nit mutants was attempted using nitrite, hypoxanthine, and ammonium media. Complementation between nit mutants was tested on MM as described, and heterokaryons were usually evident within 10 to 15 days. When mutants from two different isolates formed a heterokaryon, their parent isolates were assigned to the same vegetative compatibility group (VCG).
For the isolation and purification of fungal DNA, liquid cultures comprising 100 ml of MS in 250-ml Erlenmeyer flasks were inoculated with five mycelial disks derived from colony margins. The cultures were agitated for 5 to 6 days on a rotary shaker (150 rpm, 25°C) and fragmented 12 hours before harvesting the mycelia by blending for 10 seconds at 24,000 rpm using a tissue homogenizer (Ultra-Turrax T25, Janke & Kunkel, IKA Labortechnik, Staufen, Germany) to stimulate new growth. Mycelia were collected by vacuum filtration and lyophilized until dry. DNA was extracted and purified as previously described. The DNA was dissolved in 0.5 ml of TE buffer (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA; pH 8.0) to an approximate concentration of 200 to 500 µg/ml, and then diluted to a concentration of 10 to 100 ng/ml for PCR.
This study characterizes Colletotrichum isolates originating from typical anthracnose-diseased plants and atypical, stunted plants. A total of 147 monoconidial isolates (one per plant) were characterized. Out of these, 127 isolates were obtained from the crown, stolon, and fruit tissues of anthracnose-affected plants from six cultivars collected in seven commercial plots across four sites. The remaining 20 isolates were sourced from decaying roots of stunted, chlorotic plants from three cultivars, collected in four plots at three sites.
Approximately 100 diseased plants exhibiting symptoms of stunting and chlorosis were unearthed for a visual examination of their crowns and roots. Notably, these plants did not show foliar symptoms of anthracnose. While all crowns appeared healthy, most roots exhibited necrosis and brown discoloration.
Colletotrichum was readily recovered from roots plated on supplemented Murashige and Skoog (MS) medium. However, when roots were plated on nonsupplemented MS, the growth of contaminating Alternaria species often suppressed Colletotrichum growth. Healthy plants did not yield C. acutatum from roots, contrasting with the presence of Alternaria spp.
All isolates from different parts of diseased strawberry plants (roots, vegetative parts, and fruits) produced masses of salmon-orange acute conidia (average size 15 × 4 µm) in dense white mycelium. This morphology is characteristic of C. acutatum grown on supplemented MS or Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA).
The roots and rhizosphere of diseased plants, which were stunted, chlorotic, and had decayed and necrotic root systems, were assessed for C. acutatum colonization by plating on supplemented MS. Root segments from all tested plants yielded colonies of C. acutatum. The percentage of root infections was 56 ± 8 for field-grown plants and 60 ± 12 for those grown in perlite. However, the level of C. acutatum in the rhizosphere of plants in perlite was approximately 2.5 times higher than that in field soil (18,750 ± 3,375 and 7,600 ± 2,150 CFU/g, respectively).
Four C. acutatum isolates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom development could be affected by the source of the isolate. The tested isolates, regardless of their origin, caused typical anthracnose symptoms on petioles, leaves, and stolons of both Chandler and Sharon cultivars 7 to 10 days after inoculation. After 30 days, 100% mortality was observed in all foliar-inoculated plants, compared to 0% mortality in the water control plants, which remained healthy thereafter.

The vegetative compatibility grouping of isolates involved a selection of 10 isolates for the initial test. Among these, three isolates (TUT-5954, TUT-232:1, and TUT-232:2) were obtained from plant clinics, while the remaining seven were sourced from stolons (TUT-8V, TUT-9A, TUT-73A, and TUT-75A) or crown tissue (TUT-6AB, TUT-7E, and TUT-22A) of diseased plants from two locations (see Table 1). A total of 112 nit mutants were derived from these isolates. However, attempts to phenotype the mutants using media containing nitrate, nitrite, hypoxanthine, or ammonium as nitrogen sources were unsuccessful. The growth on nitrite and hypoxanthine was variable and unclear.
The mutants from each isolate were paired among themselves to assess complementation within isolates, and 16 representative mutants were then paired in all possible inter-isolate combinations. All mutants successfully formed stable complementary heterokaryons with at least some other mutants. The pattern of heterokaryon formation indicated that all 10 isolates belonged to a single vegetative compatibility group (VCG).
In addition to the original group, nit mutants were generated from another 105 isolates and paired with representative complementary mutants from the first group. The formation of complementary heterokaryons revealed that 103 of these isolates were part of the VCG defined by the initial group, while the isolates TUT-111A and TUT-742D displayed heterokaryon self-incompatibility. A total of 39 randomly chosen mutants were categorized into seven complementation groups, consisting of 1, 1, 3, 3, 4, 7, and 20 mutants. The largest group (refer to Table 3: group A) likely contains nit1 mutants, whereas the others include one group of nit3 mutants and five groups of NitM mutants.
The results from around 700 pairings between 16 mutants representing the seven complementation groups, along with random nit mutants from the 113 vegetatively compatible isolates studied, are summarized in Table 3. Complementary heterokaryons were formed in half of the pairings with group A mutants and in all pairings with group F and G mutants. In contrast, 86 to 99% of pairings involving mutants from groups B through E resulted in complementation. Thus, any pair of mutants from different complementation groups B through G (as shown in Table 3) can serve as reliable representatives of the local C. acutatum population from strawberries in vegetative compatibility tests.
Comparison of Colletotrichum isolates by ap-PCR. The Israeli isolates were categorized based on site, plot, cultivar, and strawberry tissue origins (refer to Table 1). Genomic DNA from 121 Israeli isolates obtained from crown, fruit, and stolons was amplified via ap-PCR using four oligonucleotide primers: (CAG)5, (GACA)4, (TGTC)4, and (GACAC)3. The resulting amplicons for each primer were nearly identical.

Complementation Groups: The complementation groups are designated arbitrarily from A to G.
Mutant Pairings: The table details the number of complementary heterokaryons formed in various pairings and the corresponding mean square for each group.
Ap-PCR was also performed using DNA from an additional 20 isolates collected from diseased roots, and the results were compared to the reference isolate CA-330-1 of C. acutatum. Identical amplicons were obtained with the primer (GACA)₄ (Fig. 3), although slight differences were observed between U.S. and Israeli isolates using the primers (CAG)₅, (TGTC)₄, and (GACAC)₃ (data not shown).
The primary aim of this research was to identify the species of Colletotrichum responsible for the first outbreak of anthracnose disease in Israel and to determine whether the same or different species caused root necrosis in strawberry nurseries and production fields. In a morphotaxonomic comparison, isolates from the aboveground parts of anthracnose-affected plants and from necrotic, decayed roots of stunted, chlorotic plants appeared uniform and were classified as C. acutatum. Isolates from both fruits and roots showed equal pathogenicity in artificial inoculations, indicating that both anthracnose and root necrosis were caused by the same pathogen. All isolates, including those from roots, were vegetatively compatible with each other, demonstrating uniformity within the pathogen population. Additionally, molecular DNA analyses confirmed the uniformity of the population and its classification as C. acutatum, based on comparisons with reference cultures of the major strawberry Colletotrichum pathogens.
Abundant anthracnose infestation was evident in many nurseries during the summers of 1995 and 1996, resulting in a massive collapse of transplants in soil-fumigated fields. Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel indicated that populations of C. acutatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable levels (S. Freeman, unpublished data). Therefore, the likelihood of persistent soil contamination by a soilborne inoculum of C. acutatum appears low, especially since soil fumigation is a standard practice.
Although disease symptoms caused by the three major species—C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides—are similar, it is crucial to identify the specific causal agent of the disease for regulatory and breeding purposes, as well as for the selection of effective control measures. For instance, isolates of C. gloeosporioides are sensitive to benzimidazole fungicides, whereas isolates of C. acutatum are not (1). Similarly, the slow-growing orange strains of C. acutatum exhibit more tolerance to benomyl than the fast-growing gray forms of C. gloeosporioides, both of which affect...
Molecular tools have been successfully utilized to differentiate between the species of Colletotrichum responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Isolates of C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides infecting strawberries were distinctly different in nuclear and A+T-rich DNA analyses, as well as in amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methods. Similarly, sequencing and restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) have been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species from strawberries. In populations of C. acutatum and C. fragariae from strawberries, little genomic variation was observed within each species using various molecular methods. In contrast, high diversity was observed in populations of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries, which possess the perfect stage. However, C. acutatum isolated from strawberries in Europe were distinct from American strawberry isolates. Likewise, isolates of C. acutatum from other hosts, such as peach and pecan, were separate from the strawberry pathogen, suggesting that C. acutatum is not a uniform group.
The uniformity of C. acutatum strawberry isolates in Israel, as illustrated by population grouping based on vegetative compatibility, suggests that the recent disease outbreak was due to a single introduction of the pathogen to Israel. The uniform AFLP profiles further indicate that these isolates belong to an asexually reproducing clonal population of apparent U.S. origin.
C. acutatum causing strawberry anthracnose is predominantly a pathogen of fruit, stolons, and crowns. However, as demonstrated in this work, under appropriate environmental, agrotechnical, and epidemiological conditions, the pathogen can cause severe stunting and mortality of plants by infecting the root system.
