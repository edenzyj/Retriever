Abstract: Two half-diallel mating designs were conducted to study the inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds on runners of strawberry. The main design included six genotypes representing a range of responses to the pathogen: ‘Chandler’ (very susceptible); FL 87-210 (tolerant); MS/US 541 (very resistant); NC 92-01 (Fragaria chiloensis Duch.) (resistant); NCH 87-10 (tolerant-susceptible); and NCC 89-39 (susceptible). The cross ‘Chandler’ x MS/US 541 was not included. The secondary test involved ‘Chandler’ and selections FL 87-210 and NC 85-01 (Fragaria virginiana Duch.) (very resistant) as parents. Griffing’s methods 4 and 2, model I, were used to test for combining ability in the main and secondary tests, respectively. General combining ability and specific combining ability were highly significant in all analyses. This study indicated that nonadditive effects are more important than additive effects in the inheritance of resistance of runners to anthracnose. The frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies suggests that resistance to C. acutatum on runners is quantitative. Therefore, breeding for resistance should be accomplished using progeny testing followed by individual selection within progenies.
Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. (Milholland, 1981; Gupton and Smith, 1991) is one of the most important factors limiting strawberry production in many southeastern regions (Horn et al., 1972; Smith and Black, 1985; 1987, 1990).
The studies conducted on the NCARS or its named products, as well as critiques of major genes, did not specify similar studies that were not mentioned. These studies did not indicate which isolates (races) of Colletotrichum acutatum were used to screen for resistance. In the latter study, runner inoculation was utilized to determine the inheritance of resistance. This was established by screening the parents, S1, and reciprocal F1 progenies obtained from crosses between susceptible and resistant parents. The inconclusive information about resistance to anthracnose justifies further research. Currently, there is no available information in the literature regarding estimates of combining ability for resistance to C. acutatum. This study was undertaken to gather more information about the inheritance of resistance and to estimate both general and specific combining abilities in relation to resistance against C. acutatum in strawberry runners.
Plant Material: Six parent genotypes that varied in their reaction to C. acutatum were crossed using a half-diallel design, and the resulting progenies were utilized in this experiment. The parents included in the main test were primarily F. × ananassa genotypes, except where indicated, and comprised: MS/US 541 (very resistant), NC 92-01 (F. chiloensis) (resistant), FL 87-210 (resistant-tolerant), NCH 87-10 (tolerant-susceptible), NCC 89-39 (susceptible-tolerant), and 'Chandler' (very susceptible). The F. chiloensis parent (NC 92-01) originated from an open-pollinated seedling derived from a mixed planting of collected wild clones of the species on a farm near Panguipulli, Chile. A total of 15 crosses were made (calculated as p(p-1)/2, where p represents the number of parents). Due to a labeling error in handling the seeds, the cross ‘Chandler’ x MS/US 541 was excluded from the analysis, with its effects considered equal to zero in the combining ability analysis. In a secondary test, the only successful cross combinations involved the parents NC 85-01 (F. virginiana) (very resistant), FL 87-210 (resistant-tolerant), and ‘Chandler’ (very susceptible). NC 85-01 was derived from open-pollinated seeds collected from a wild F. virginiana population in Wake County, N.C. The crosses were made in Spring 1994, and five hundred seeds from each cross were placed under mist in 13-cm pots filled with sand in a greenhouse in December 1994. Once the seedlings reached the two true leaf stage, they were transplanted into 40-cell plug trays containing a peat substrate (Fafard Mix No. 4-P; Conrad Fafard, Agawam, Mass.) and placed on greenhouse benches. The transplanting dates varied based on plant development, commencing on January 25 and concluding on February 20, 1995. A total of 80 seedlings from each cross and 25 plants from each parent were transplanted. Plants were watered daily and fertilized weekly with a 20–20–20 nutrient solution (3 g·L–1 of water) to promote healthy growth and enhance runner formation. To prevent competition with runners, all flowers were removed from parent plants. The seedlings were inoculated when they were approximately four months old and the runners were at least 15 cm long. All seedlings and parent plants were grown in the Horticulture Greenhouse facilities at North Carolina State University (NCSU) in Raleigh.
Inoculation: Milholland’s technique was employed to screen progeny and parents for resistance to anthracnose (Ballington and Milholland, 1993). The most virulent isolate of C. acutatum (CA-1), evaluated in a prior study (Ballington and Milholland, 1993), was cultivated on potato dextrose agar (PDA) medium in petri dishes for 10 days at room temperature (25 °C) under continuous fluorescent light.
Disease Index: Disease severity was rated according to the length of lesion development on the runner: 0.0–1.9 cm = resistant; 2.0–2.9 cm = intermediate; and >3.0 cm = susceptible (Ballington and Milholland, 1993).
Statistics: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using the general linear models procedure (PROC GLM, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Estimates of general and specific combining ability were determined using standard methodology for analyzing data from diallel crosses (Griffing, 1956). Method 4, model I (fixed) based on F1s, and Method 2, model I (fixed), based on parents and F1s (half diallel), were used for the analysis of the main and secondary tests, respectively. These methods and models for combining ability analysis were selected because of the characteristics of the experiments in this study (i.e., a reduced number of parents were used without reciprocal crosses). When a limited number of parents are evaluated (<10) and the selection of these parents cannot be considered random, then a fixed model is recommended (Baker, 1978; Christie and Shattuck, 1992). Griffing’s analysis of combining ability requires no special genetic assumptions beyond those necessary for the ANOVA and has been used to convey reliable information on the combining potential of parents (Baker, 1978; Christie and Shattuck, 1992). Baker (1978) concluded that diallel analyses should be used only to estimate combining ability, and attempting to interpret diallel statistics in terms of components of genetic variance is subject to failure in either of both assumptions of independent distribution of genes in the parent and absence of epistasis, unless parents have been produced by a process of random mating and non-selective inbreeding.
Main Test: The ANOVA for the main test showed highly significant differences among genotypes (Table 1). The general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were highly significant (Table 1), suggesting that additive and non-additive effects were involved in the inheritance of resistance to isolate CA-1 of C. acutatum on runners in these populations. The largest deviation from expected for shorter mean lesion length was observed with the crosses NCH 87-10 x NCC 89-39 and FL 87-210 x NC 92-01. Thus, parent means for mean lesion length confirmed the resistance designations of these parental genotypes (Table 2). GCA effects for these crosses indicate that they are good hybrid combinations for runner resistance to anthracnose.
Table Description: The results from Table 1 illustrate the mean squares for general combining ability (GCA) and specific combining ability (SCA), revealing highly significant differences among the genotypes tested. This highlights the impact of both additive and non-additive genetic effects on the traits being evaluated. Table 2 presents the mean lesion lengths for different parental combinations, confirming their resistance classifications. Table 3 summarizes the SCA values for various hybrid combinations, indicating how each progeny compares to the average performance of their parent genotypes regarding mean lesion length.
Resistance is crucial for preventing secondary infections in plants. The ANOVA results for half- and fruit infections in the field were analyzed using a diallel design with 'Chandler', FL 87-210, and NC 85-01, as noted by Milholland (1993). The best parents for resistance were identified as MS/US 541 and FL 87-210, which showed highly significant differences among genotypes (data not shown; see Giménez, 1997 for details). The highest general combining ability (GCA) for susceptibility was recorded for 'Chandler'. Both GCA and specific combining ability (SCA) mean squares were highly significant.
The analysis of variance includes the following sources: Genotype, Replications, Crosses, GCA, SCA, and Error. The degrees of freedom (df) and mean squares (MS) are presented for each source, with significant F-values indicating highly significant differences among genotypes.
This table outlines the average lesion lengths (in centimeters) for different strawberry varieties, along with their respective GCA values for resistance to anthracnose. For example, 'Chandler' has a lesion length of 8.95 cm and a GCA of 0.49, while NC 85-01 shows a GCA of –1.65, indicating its potential as a superior parent for reduced lesion length.
This table presents the SCA values, mean lesion lengths, and seedling responses to anthracnose for various strawberry hybrid combinations. Each cross is detailed with the corresponding SCA and lesion length, as well as the number of resistant, intermediate, and susceptible seedlings screened. For instance, the cross FL 87-210 x NCC 89-39 shows an SCA of 1.00 and a lesion length of 6.6 cm, with 76 seedlings screened, of which 13 were resistant.
Overall, these findings highlight the importance of both additive and non-additive variance in the inheritance of resistance to anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum acutatum in strawberry runners. The GCA/SCA variance ratio is valuable for comparing the significance of these variance components. A relatively high ratio indicates a strong influence of additive gene effects, while a low ratio suggests the presence of non-additive effects such as dominance or epistasis. Although both combining abilities were significant in the main experiment, the SCA mean square was greater.

Variance (Watkins and Spangelo, 1968) can be improved by evaluating a large number of parental combinations (progeny testing) to identify and select the best combinations for resistance to anthracnose. In a second phase, these best crosses should be grown on a larger scale to select the best genotypes among them. Additionally, recombination of the best selections can be performed to obtain improved populations. Selection in a breeding program typically involves multiple characteristics; therefore, the best crosses should combine anthracnose resistance with other desirable horticultural traits.
Nature of Gene Action. The frequency distribution of lesion lengths for representative progenies indicates that variation is continuous (see Figures 1 and 2). Thus, resistance to anthracnose caused by isolate CA-1 of C. acutatum on strawberry runners appears to be quantitative in nature. This finding contrasts with previous studies (Gupton and Smith, 1991; Faedi and De Clauser, 1991; Winterbottom et al., 1991), which suggested major gene action for the inheritance of resistance. It is important to note that the mating scheme, method of genetic analysis, parental lines, and isolate of C. acutatum used in this study differ from those in earlier research, potentially leading to varying results.
The results of this study suggest that both non-additive and additive effects play significant roles in the inheritance of resistance of strawberry runners to C. acutatum. However, since the estimate of specific combining ability (SCA) variance was greater than the general combining ability (GCA) variance, non-additive inheritance seems to be more critical. The frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies further indicates that the inheritance of resistance to C. acutatum on strawberry runners is indeed quantitative. Therefore, genetic progress for anthracnose resistance can be achieved through progeny testing to select the best parental combinations, followed by individual selection within the best progenies.
