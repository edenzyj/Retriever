MacKenzie, S. J., Legard, D. E., Timmer, L. W., Chandler, C. K., and Peres, N. A. 2006. Resistance of strawberry cultivars to crown rot caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates from Florida is nonspecific. Plant Dis. 90:1091-1097.
Isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) and native grape were tested for virulence on strawberry cultivars in field experiments over three seasons. Isolate aggressiveness and cultivar resistance were determined by the proportion of plants killed at a defined time. Each year, four to six isolates were inoculated on four to seven different cultivars, with a subset of isolates and cultivars evaluated again the following season. On the dates that disease was evaluated, incidence ranged from 10% to 84% for individual cultivars. Cultivar and isolate effects were significant in all three seasons, but there was no significant cultivar by isolate interaction in any season. Thus, resistance to C. gloeosporioides appears to be nonspecific. In the third season, one isolate of Colletotrichum fragariae from strawberry and one from oak were included. There was no significant cultivar by isolate interaction detected for this species, although there were significant differences among cultivars and isolates. When comparing the resistance of cultivars to both species, the rankings were similar, but a modest cultivar by species interaction was evident. The cultivar 'Treasure' was more resistant to crown rot caused by either species than any other cultivar tested.
Colletotrichum crown rot of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) can be caused by any of three fungi: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata), C. fragariae, or C. acutatum. The closely related species C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides produce a reddish-brown necrosis of crown tissue following infection, which causes plants to wilt and collapse. Under greenhouse conditions or in summer nurseries, C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides may also produce necroses on stolons, lesions on fruit, or black leaf spots. Although C. acutatum can also cause crown rot, disease symptoms in plants infected with this species are distinct from those caused by the other two pathogens. There is some uncertainty regarding the initial occurrence of C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides in Florida and historically which of these species was responsible for epidemics in the region. C. fragariae was first reported in Florida nurseries by Brooks in 1935. The first description of crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides is also recorded.
Crown rot is a serious disease in the subtropical strawberry production regions of Florida. Historical isolates previously described as C. fragariae were reclassified as C. gloeosporioides based on conidial and setal morphology. This suggests that C. gloeosporioides may have contributed to crown rot epidemics prior to its initial report in 1984 but was misidentified as C. fragariae. At least two of the reclassified isolates produced fertile perithecia when grown together in culture, indicating that they were heterothallic. Several of these isolates have been characterized using molecular methods, and in addition to being distinct from C. fragariae, they also appear to be distinct from homothallic isolates of G. cingulata. Currently, C. gloeosporioides is the most frequently isolated Colletotrichum species from diseased crowns in Florida. The isolates from diseased crown tissue have diverse genotypes and appear to belong to a recombining population. They exhibit the Cgl-2 genotype A+T-rich DNA banding pattern originally identified in C. fragariae. The pathogen also appears to have a broad host range, as the population on noncultivated host species adjacent to strawberry fields is genetically indistinguishable from that on strawberries and contains isolates pathogenic to strawberries.
Previous studies examining variation in strawberry resistance to C. fragariae found a wide range of susceptibility among cultivars and aggressiveness among isolates. One study identified a significant cultivar by isolate interaction. Host resistance studies using homothallic G. cingulata isolates were less conclusive due to the limited number of isolates tested. Significant variation in cultivar susceptibility and isolate aggressiveness was observed, along with a significant cultivar by isolate interaction in one study. In a later study using a different set of isolates, only cultivar susceptibility varied. For C. acutatum, a specific interaction between strawberry cultivars and isolates was noted, with a single dominant gene appearing to be responsible for this interaction. This gene results in either an incompatible reaction with cultivars carrying it or an intermediate degree of compatibility. Assays used to evaluate resistance to C. fragariae and C. acutatum were based on symptom development on petioles or foliage and did not specifically assess the plants' ability to resist necrosis of crown tissue. Variation in cultivar susceptibility to C. gloeosporioides isolates from Florida has not yet been investigated.
In this study, we examined the levels of resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides in commonly grown cultivars in Florida, as well as the patterns of virulence and aggressiveness among C. gloeosporioides isolates under field conditions. This research aims to provide useful information to breeders regarding mechanisms and sources of resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides. Additionally, this information is valuable for growers deciding which cultivars to plant and from which nursery locations to purchase plants, especially considering that losses due to crown rot can be particularly severe for susceptible cultivars propagated in local Florida nurseries where the disease is most prevalent.
Plants were grown on raised, plastic mulch-covered beds that were 71 cm wide, 15 cm high at the edges, and 18 cm high in the center. Each bed contained two rows of strawberry plants, with a spacing of 30.5 cm between the rows and 38 cm between plants within each row. The distance between the centers of the beds was 1.22 m. Before planting, the beds were fumigated with methyl bromide/chloropicrin (98:2) at a rate of 350 kg/ha. Leaf-on, bare-root transplants were set on 18 October for the 2001–2002 season, 16 October for the 2002–2003 season, and 29 October for the 2003–2004 season. The plants were overhead irrigated for 10 to 12 days to facilitate establishment. After establishment, water and fertilizer were provided through drip tape. Weekly applications of Captan 80WP (Micro Flo, Memphis, TN; n-trichloromethylthio-4-cyclohexene-1,2-dicarboximide) at 4.2 kg/ha began two weeks after the plants were inoculated. This fungicide prevents new crown infections without inhibiting the progress of already established infections (J. C. Mertely, unpublished) and was used to prevent the spread of inoculum from collapsed crowns to adjacent plots. Freeze and frost protection was provided by overhead sprinklers when necessary.
Fungal isolates and inoculation procedures involved obtaining strawberry crown isolates from samples submitted to the diagnostic clinic at the University of Florida Gulf Coast Research and Education Center in Dover. During the 2002–2003 season, an isolate from a lesion on wild grape (Vitis rotundifolia) was included, and an ascospore isolate from a perithecium emerging from a strawberry petiole was included during the 2003–2004 season. The isolates were identified as C. gloeosporioides using a species-specific internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region primer and random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) analysis. Briefly, a species-specific ITS primer that produces a positive polymerase chain reaction (PCR) product from C. gloeosporioides or C. fragariae template DNA was used for initial species identification. Subsequently, bands from five RAPD primer amplification reactions were scored for each isolate. Based on RAPD banding patterns, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates fell into two distinct clusters. All C. gloeosporioides isolates were in the same cluster but had distinct RAPD banding patterns from one another, indicating that they were not vegetatively produced from the same parent strain. Isolates were also obtained from seven cultivars to reduce the chance of over-sampling a race that might be selected for a specific cultivar. The pathogenicity of isolates to strawberries was confirmed by injecting inoculum into the crown tissue of greenhouse-grown strawberry plants prior to being used in field experiments. Four to six C. gloeosporioides isolates were used for inoculations each season. Two isolates of C. fragariae, one from a strawberry crown and the other from an oak (Quercus sp.) leaf lesion in Lake Alfred, FL, were included in the study during the 2003–2004 season.
Inoculum was prepared from 6- to 8-day-old cultures grown under continuous fluorescent light at 24°C on potato dextrose agar. Conidial suspensions used for inoculations were prepared in sterile deionized water, filtered through four layers of cheesecloth, and diluted to 5 × 10^5 conidia/ml. Inoculations were performed by spraying 2 ml of conidial suspension directly into the crown of plants 15 to 17 days after the plants were set in the field. The inoculation dates were 2 November 2001 for the 2001–2002 season, 31 October 2002 for the 2002–2003 season, and 15 November 2003 for the 2003–2004 season.
n. Data for each season were analyzed separately using PROC MIXED of SAS (SAS Institute, Cary, NC).
Table 1 describes the Colletotrichum isolates used to inoculate experiments conducted over three seasons in Dover, FL. The table includes the isolate designations along with their corresponding collection sites in Florida and the years of collection. The isolates listed include 95-63A, 96-15A, 96-83H, 96-83R, 97-15A, 97-45A, 97-47C, 97-63, 98-285, 00-59, 00-117, 02-172, C-16, and 02-135. Most of the isolates were derived from Fragaria × ananassa (Duchesne) with various cultivars such as 'Oso Grande', 'Selva', 'Sweet Charlie', 'Camarosa', 'Strawberry Festival', 'Rosa Linda', and 'Gaviota'. Collection sites and years include multiple entries from Dover spanning 1995 to 2002. The isolates were collected from different parts of the plant, including the petiole and crown.
In the analysis of the data for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae, "block" was considered a random effect while "cultivar" and "isolate" were fixed effects. When analyzing combined data for both pathogens, "species," "isolate," and "cultivar" were treated as fixed effects, with "isolate" nested within "species". Uninoculated plots were excluded from any reported analyses. The risk of type I error (α) was set at 0.05 for least square means t-tests comparing transformed disease incidence among cultivars, without adjustments for multiple comparisons.
Visual comparisons of graphs depicting plant mortality over time after inoculation with C. gloeosporioides showed differing patterns of symptom development across the three seasons (Fig. 1A to C). During the 2001–2002 season, most plants exhibiting crown rot symptoms did so within the first 55 days post-inoculation. In contrast, the 2002–2003 season experienced rapid plant collapse mainly in 'Gaviota' and 'Camarosa' during the same period, with a notable slowing in symptom development between days 50 and 130. Unlike the previous season, there was a spike in plant death late in the 2002–2003 season. The 2003–2004 season showed symptoms developing consistently throughout for all tested cultivars. The rankings of susceptibility among the cultivars remained relatively stable over time, though some, such as 'Earlibrite', 'Strawberry Festival', and 'FL 99-164', initially displayed low disease incidence, which accelerated towards season’s end. Only 'Camarosa' was examined for susceptibility to C. gloeosporioides across all three seasons, consistently showing high plant collapse rates ranging from 62% to 84%. C. fragariae was inoculated only during the 2003–2004 season (Fig. 1D), with similar symptom development patterns to those observed with C. gloeosporioides. The spread of pathogens from external sources did not seem to influence the results, as disease incidence in uninoculated control plots ranged from 0% in 2002–2003 to 0.12% in 2003–2004.
The dates of 19 March 2004 corresponded to 63, 148, and 125 days after inoculation during the 2003–2004 season. On these dates, the absolute value of the difference between the number of plots with 0% plant mortality and those with 100% plant mortality was minimized. This reduction helped to minimize compression bias toward one extreme value or the other (0% or 100% mortality). Additionally, on these dates, the number of plots with either 0% or 100% mortality was low, and the variance among treatment combinations was relatively high.
Data analysis for Colletotrichum gloeosporioides revealed strong isolate and cultivar effects, but no significant cultivar by isolate interaction was found in each of the three seasons studied. In contrast, when the data for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae from the 2003–2004 season were combined, there was an observed effect of species, cultivar, and isolate on disease incidence, as well as a small but significant species by cultivar interaction. This interaction resulted from changes in the rankings of ‘Strawberry Festival’ and ‘Camino Real’ across the different fungal species. Disease reactions to isolates of the different Colletotrichum species were very similar, except for this one rank change.
The mean percent mortality for strawberry cultivars was calculated at weekly intervals throughout the growing season using data from all isolates. This included plants inoculated with C. gloeosporioides during the 2001–2002, 2002–2003, and 2003–2004 seasons, as well as those inoculated with C. fragariae during the 2003–2004 season. Arrows indicate the time points where disease incidence data were used for statistical analysis.
For the 2001-2002 season, F-values for the cultivar × isolate interaction and cultivar alone were significant (<0.001).
In the 2002-2003 season, both the cultivar × isolate interaction and cultivar alone were also significant (<0.001).
The 2003-2004 season showed significant results for the cultivar × isolate interaction and cultivar (<0.001), while one F-value was not significant (0.823).
The residual variance estimates and degrees of freedom for each season were noted, indicating appropriate statistical rigor.
Additionally, all cultivars except ‘Gaviota’, FL 99-164, ‘Carmine’, and ‘Camino Real’ were tested in at least two seasons. ‘Treasure’ was identified as more resistant, while ‘Gaviota’ was found to be more susceptible than any of the other cultivars examined. ‘Strawberry Festival’ had an intermediate level of resistance, approximately the same as that of ‘Aromas’.

Table 3. Analysis of variance for the 2003-2004 experiment evaluating the incidence of crown rot in relation to strawberry cultivar and isolate of Colletotrichum fragariae, either alone or in comparison with C. gloeosporioides.
The y F-values for the analysis examining C. fragariae only were calculated using a residual variance estimate equal to 0.034 with 33 degrees of freedom. The F-values for the analysis examining both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides were calculated using a residual variance estimate equal to 0.033 with 125 degrees of freedom.
In the 2003–2004 season, the genotypes grown included FL 99-164, ‘Carmine’, and ‘Camino Real’, which exhibited intermediate resistance levels between the highly resistant ‘Treasure’ and the relatively susceptible ‘Strawberry Festival’ and ‘Camarosa’.
During the 2001–2002 season, isolates were grouped into four categories based on their average aggressiveness toward the four cultivars tested (as detailed in Table 5). Isolate 97-15A was identified as the most aggressive, while isolates 95-63A, 97-45A, and 97-47C displayed relatively high and comparable levels of aggressiveness. Isolates 98-285 and 97-63 were less aggressive, with 97-63 being the least aggressive of the two. In the following season, 2002–2003, these isolates were re-evaluated alongside others, resulting in the formation of four isolate clusters based on aggressiveness. The rankings among isolates remained consistent, although 98-285 and 97-63 were not significantly different from each other. Isolates 00-59 and 96-83R were found to be highly aggressive, while 96-83H, a non-strawberry isolate, was the least aggressive. For the 2003–2004 season, isolate 00-59 was again identified as highly aggressive, with isolate 02-172 being more aggressive than isolate 96-15A and ascospore isolate 00-117. In separate analyses comparing inoculated plots to uninoculated controls, all isolate treatments exhibited significantly more crown rot than the controls (data not shown).
Cultivar rankings for resistance to C. fragariae were very similar to those for C. gloeosporioides during the season when this species was included in the study (see Table 4). ‘Treasure’ was highly resistant to C. fragariae, while FL 99-164 and ‘Carmine’ showed moderate resistance, and ‘Strawberry Festival’ and ‘Camarosa’ were more susceptible.
Figure 3. Cultivar by species means for transformed disease incidences calculated 125 days after inoculation with Colletotrichum fragariae or C. gloeosporioides during the 2003–2004 season. The y-axis displays the back-transformed incidences ranging from 0 to 100% at intervals of 10%.
Pathogenicity trials conducted over three years using 12 distinct C. gloeosporioides isolates and 10 strawberry cultivars identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates. However, they failed to identify any cultivar by isolate interactions. A more limited study using two C. fragariae isolates inoculated on six strawberry cultivars during the third year also identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates, but similarly did not reveal any cultivar by isolate interaction. When the resistance rankings of cultivars were compared between the two pathogen species, a small but significant cultivar by species interaction was observed.
Horizontal resistance is effective against all isolates of a pathogen, while vertical resistance is effective against a subset of isolates. These terms are synonymous with race-non-specific and race-specific resistance, respectively. In pathosystems where race-specific resistance occurs, an incompatible interaction between the host and pathogen often requires a dominant host resistance gene and a dominant pathogen avirulence gene. Such interactions are described by the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Race-non-specific resistance is less understood but is believed to be governed by multiple host genes that incrementally contribute to the overall resistance of the plant. Vanderplank proposed using analysis of variance to determine the contribution of race-non-specific and/or race-specific resistance within a host population against a group of pathogen isolates. The absence of a cultivar by isolate interaction is evidence of race-non-specific resistance using this method. A cultivar by isolate interaction suggests that race-specific mechanisms contribute to the resistance observed within the host population, although deviations from additivity could be responsible for the statistical interaction. Deviations from additivity arise from the scale used to measure resistance, while rank changes are consistent with physiological responses.
The table presents disease incidence percentages for two pathogen species, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae, across three growing seasons: 2001-2002, 2002-2003, and 2003-2004.
For C. gloeosporioides, several isolates are listed, with varying disease incidence percentages reported for each season. The isolate 97-15A shows the highest incidence at 86.8% in the first year, while isolates like 00-117 and 97-63 report significantly lower incidences in later years. Notably, the isolate 96-15A consistently shows low resistance, with 36.3% in 2001-2002 and dropping further in subsequent years.
For C. fragariae, two isolates are shown, with isolate 02-135 reporting an incidence of 40.9% in the first year and isolate C-16 showing a lower incidence of 24.7% in the following year. This data highlights the differences in aggressiveness among the isolates and the varying levels of disease resistance in the tested strawberry cultivars.
Disease incidence percentages were statistically analyzed using mean transformed disease incidences. Reported values were calculated by back-transforming the mean arcsine square root of disease incidences for all cultivars inoculated with an isolate.
No interactions between cultivars and isolates were detected in this study, suggesting that race-non-specific resistance mechanisms are responsible for the differences in resistance. Statistical tests only compare means for isolates of the same species within the same season. In each column, means followed by the same letter are not significantly different based on least squares means t-tests (P = 0.05).
Statistical tests were conducted on mean transformed disease incidences, which were calculated by back-transforming the mean arcsine square root disease incidences for all isolates inoculated on a cultivar.
During the 2001–2002 season, symptoms of crown rot appeared to progress more quickly early in the season compared to the 2002–2003 or 2003–2004 seasons. This accelerated progression was likely due to higher early-season temperatures; the average daily temperature in December was 18.3°C, which is 3.7°C higher than the averages in the other seasons. Conversely, the mean daily temperature in January 2002–2003 was 11.6°C, 2.5°C lower than the mean temperatures of January in the other two seasons, which may have contributed to a slowdown in symptom development during that period.
A cultivar-by-isolate interaction for resistance has been demonstrated for Colletotrichum acutatum (15). A single dominant gene (Rca2) appears to be responsible for this interaction (16) and distinguishes two groups of C. acutatum: those producing a non-compatible reaction with cultivars having Rca2 (group 2) and those having an intermediate degree of compatibility with cultivars possessing the Rca2 gene (group 1) (15). Although C. acutatum is more distantly related to C. gloeosporioides than to C. fragariae (35) and produces different disease symptoms on strawberry (27), there is evidence that resistance to C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and G. cingulata is correlated (34). Cultivars that are at least moderately resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum examined in the current study include 'Sweet Charlie' (8), 'Carmine' (10), and 'Earlibrite' (C. K. Chandler, unpublished). 'Sweet Charlie' is field immune to fruit rot, whereas 'Carmine' and 'Earlibrite' are moderately resistant. Although the mechanism of resistance to C. acutatum in these cultivars has not been examined, it is likely that they possess at least one copy of a dominant resistance gene against group 2 C. acutatum isolates. A dominant resistance gene to this group of isolates was found in 13 of 14 cultivars from the United States and Europe classified as intermediately susceptible or resistant to anthracnose fruit rot, whereas it occurred in only one of seven cultivars classified as susceptible (16). Additionally, cultivars such as 'Dover', which is homozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), and 'Sequoia', which is heterozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), are present in the pedigrees of the three fruit rot-resistant cultivars used in the current study (9–11). With the exception of 'Treasure', no cultivar displayed significantly greater resistance to crown rot than 'Sweet Charlie', 'Earlibrite', and 'Carmine', suggesting that major gene resistance to C. acutatum could also be effective against C. gloeosporioides. The lack of a cultivar-by-isolate interaction observed with isolates of C. gloeosporioides could be due to little variation in a gene product or products in this species that are homologous to those responsible for the interaction with C. acutatum. Also important is the fact that 'Treasure' was found to be highly susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum in field trials conducted over two years (C. K. Chandler, unpublished), indicating that genes responsible for resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides do not necessarily confer resistance to C. acutatum.
Race-specific resistance is most frequently found in biotrophic plant-microbe interactions where there is prolonged contact between the pathogen and the living host (20). Colletotrichum species use nutritional strategies ranging from necrotrophy to hemibiotrophy (29). Colletotrichum species such as C. orbiculare, C. graminicola, C. sublineolum, C. destructivum, C. truncatum, and C. linicola are all considered hemibiotrophs, as there is an asymptomatic biotrophic interaction between these species and host cells before the reaction becomes necrotrophic (29). The occurrence of a number of dominant race-specific resistance genes in beans against C. lindemuthianum, a member of the C. orbiculare species aggregate, suggests that gene-for-gene interactions play an important role in host resistance to these pathogens.
The interaction between S. scabra cultivars and biotype A isolates of C. gloeosporioides has been demonstrated, although much of the variation in resistance among cultivars is attributed to race-non-specific mechanisms. The histopathology of infections caused by the related pathogen C. fragariae on strawberry stolons revealed that a brief biotrophic phase likely occurred before the pathogen entered an extended necrotrophic phase. This biotrophic phase lasted less than 12 hours and was considered a modification of necrotrophy rather than an example of hemibiotrophy. The lack of race-specific resistance observed in the current study suggests that the biotrophic interaction between C. gloeosporioides or C. fragariae and strawberries is both brief and limited. This finding aligns with evidence that both species can infect hosts unrelated to strawberries.
The study included an isolate of C. gloeosporioides from grape, an ascospores isolate from a strawberry petiole, and an isolate of C. fragariae from oak. The ascospores isolate exhibited a distinct RAPD profile compared to other isolates obtained from the same perithecium. It only produced fertile perithecia in culture when paired with a second isolate, indicating that it is heterothallic (S. J. MacKenzie, unpublished). Analysis of RAPD marker data showed that the ascospores and grape isolates of C. gloeosporioides grouped with the population from crown tissue, while the oak isolate of C. fragariae grouped with the population from strawberry.
During the 2003–2004 season, the ascospores isolate was among the least aggressive, although it matched the aggressiveness of one of the crown rot isolates. In contrast, during the 2002–2003 season, the grape isolate was less aggressive than those from strawberry crowns. This may indicate that more aggressive isolates are selected within the C. gloeosporioides population on strawberries. The C. fragariae isolate from oak exhibited greater aggressiveness and had a similar virulence pattern to the isolate from strawberry, providing further evidence that C. fragariae from strawberry is derived from a population with a broad host range, as the oak isolate was collected 28 km away from any strawberry production area.
The only detected interaction was between the species of isolate and cultivar, which was minimal, with only one rank change occurring between cultivars. While further studies are needed to confirm these findings, they suggest that resistance to C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae is positively correlated, and that differences exist in the mechanisms of resistance to these two species.
