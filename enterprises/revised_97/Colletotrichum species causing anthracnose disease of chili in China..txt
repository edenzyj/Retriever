Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum species, is a serious disease affecting over 30 plant genera. Several DNA phylogenetic studies have identified Colletotrichum species that infect chili in various countries. Despite China being the largest producer of chili, with significant multi-gene analysis, little is known about the species affecting local crops. In this study, samples of diseased chili were collected from 29 provinces in China, resulting in the isolation of 1,285 strains. We observed and compared the morphological characteristics of all strains, and performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and HIS3) on selected representative strains. Fifteen Colletotrichum species were identified, with C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum being the most prevalent. Additionally, three new species, C. conoides, C. grossum, and C. liaoningense, are described in this paper. Colletotrichum aenigma, C. cliviae, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, C. incanum, C. karstii, and C. viniferum were reported for the first time in chili. Pathogenicity was confirmed for all species isolated from chili, except for C. endophytica. This study enhances our understanding of the species responsible for anthracnose in chili and provides valuable information for effective disease management in China.
The current study aims to investigate the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili (Capsicum spp.) in China through large-scale sampling and isolation, alongside morphological characterization and multi-locus phylogeny of the isolated strains. Chili is an important vegetable crop globally, with China having the largest cultivated area, producing over 28 million tons annually for domestic consumption and export (Li et al. 2009). Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is one of the most destructive diseases limiting chili production, resulting in yield losses of up to 40% in China (Lin et al. 2004).
From 2008 to 2014, fruits and leaves of chili exhibiting anthracnose symptoms were collected from 50 locations in chili-producing regions. More than ten Colletotrichum species have been reported from chili (Perfect et al. 1999; Dean et al. 2012; Farr & Rossman 2016). In our collection, we gathered samples along diagonal transects, with 25 chili fruits and leaves collected from each field as described by Cai et al. (2009). All isolates were grown at 28 °C for further study.
Sporioides, C. truncatum, and C. coccodes have been reported in China (Shin et al. 1999; Liao et al. 2012). However, most of these reports were based on morphology and ITS sequences or a combination of ITS and TUB2 sequences, which have proven insufficient in distinguishing closely related taxa within several species complexes. Additionally, these records predominantly originate from limited geographic areas, potentially underestimating the overall species diversity.
Mycelial plugs (5 mm) were transferred from the edge of actively growing cultures to fresh potato dextrose agar (PDA, 1.5%, Difco) plates. Cultures were maintained at 28 °C with a 12/12 hour fluorescent light/dark cycle. The morphological characteristics of all isolates, including colony and conidial traits, were observed. Microscopic examination was conducted with a Carl Zeiss Imager A2 microscope after one month of cultivation. Among the 1,285 obtained isolates (as shown in Table 1), 121 representative isolates were selected for further multilocus phylogenetic analyses based on geographical location, morphology (including colony shape, color, and characteristics of aerial mycelia and conidia).

Figure 1 illustrates the locations in China where chili samples were collected for Colletotrichum species identification. Each colored circle represents a different species identified preliminarily, with the size of the circle indicating the number of isolates collected from that particular location. Different morphological types were selected from each site, and the number of representative isolates was determined by the diversity of morphologies observed. If fewer than 10 isolates with similar morphology and ITS sequences were found in a location, one isolate was randomly selected. Conversely, if there were more than 10 isolates, an additional isolate was selected from each of the first 10 isolates for multilocus phylogenetic analyses. The length and width of 30 conidia for each isolate were measured in lactic acid, and the mean values were calculated. The formation of appressoria was induced according to the methods described by Cai et al. (2009).
All sequences from the 121 representative isolates were subjected to a BLAST search in GenBank. Sequences with high similarities were selected for inclusion in the analyses (as shown in Table 2a–c). Concatenated analyses of ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, HIS3, ACT, and TUB2 were performed for the C. acutatum species complex and Colletotrichum species with curved conidia.

Histone 3 (HIS3) with primers CYLH3F/CYLH3R (Crous et al. 2004b).
PCR reactions were performed as described by Damm et al. (2009). DNA sequencing was conducted by Sunbiotech in Beijing, China, using a 3730 DNA Analyzer (Applied Biosystems, USA). The sequences obtained from forward and reverse primers were combined to produce consensus sequences using DNAMAN v. 6.0 (Lynnon Biosoft, USA). Sequences were aligned with MAFFT v. 6 (Katoh & Toh 2010). All multiple parsimonious trees were saved, and clade stability was assessed through a bootstrap analysis with 1,000 replicates. Subsequently, tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated.
Bayesian inference (BI) was employed to reconstruct the phylogenetic tree using MrBayes v. 3.2.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003). The best-fit models of nucleotide substitution were selected using MrModelTest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004). Two analyses with four MCMC chains were initiated from random trees for 1,000,000 generations, sampling trees every 100 generations, resulting in a total of 20,000 trees. The first 25% of trees were discarded as the burn-in phase of each analysis, and the remaining trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities (Cai et al. 2006; Liu et al. 2012, 2013).
An additional Maximum Likelihood (ML) analysis was conducted within the C. gloeosporioides species complex using the CIPRES Science Gateway v. 3.3 (www.phylo.org), and RAxML-HPC BlackBox was selected with default parameters. Sequences derived from this study were deposited in GenBank, and the concatenated alignments were deposited in TreeBASE.
Table 1 provides a list of all Colletotrichum isolates collected from chili in China based on preliminary identification. It includes columns for species, location, host tissue, year of collection, number of isolates, and their geographical coordinates (longitude and latitude). The data reveals a variety of species collected from different regions and years, detailing their respective host tissues and the number of isolates found. This structured overview allows for an understanding of the distribution and diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with chili plants across China.

C. truncatum: Found in multiple locations, including Qingyuan (Guangdong), Maoming (Guangdong), Yichun (Jiangxi), Shizhu (Chongqing), Wuhan (Hubei), and Yangliuqing (Tianjin).
Data from 2008 to 2014 indicate a variety of fruit collections and analysis across different locations, with notable occurrences in multiple years (2011, 2012, 2013, and 2014). The collection includes fruits and leaves analyzed for various metrics.
Symptoms of anthracnose on chili fruits manifest as circular or angular sunken lesions, alongside irregular brown spots with dark edges on leaves. A total of 1,285 isolates of Colletotrichum species were collected from 29 provinces in China. Despite extensive efforts to sample symptomatic plants in Tibet and Xinjiang over several years, no suitable specimens were found. All strains were isolated from fruits, except in Jiangxi province, where severe damage was noted on chili leaves.
To assess the genealogical concordance, phylogenetic species recognition was conducted. The Genealogical Concordance Phylogenetic Species Recognition (GCPSR) model, including a pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test, was utilized to evaluate relationships among the species, specifically C. conoides, C. grossum, and C. liaoningense, using a concatenated dataset from six loci (ACT, CAL, CHS, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB2). The recombination levels were determined through PHI tests performed in SplitsTree4.
Below a 0.05 threshold (Φw < 0.05) indicated the presence of significant recombination in the dataset. The relationship between closely related species was visualized by constructing a split graph. All strains were assigned to four groups: those producing cylindrical conidia with round ends were classified as part of the C. gloeosporioides species complex; those with acute ends or cylindrical conidia with one acute end were assigned to the C. acutatum species complex; strains producing dark setae and curved conidia were categorized as Colletotrichum species with curved conidia; and the remaining strains formed a fourth group. Among the 121 isolates, 31 belonged to the C. gloeosporioides complex, 48 to the C. acutatum complex, 34 to the Colletotrichum species with curved conidia, and eight to the fourth group.
Seven chili cultivars—Capsicum annuum cv. Chaotianjiao, Denglongjiao, Sanyingjiao, Zidantou, C. frutescens cv. Shuangla, Xiaomila, and C. chinense cv. Huangdijiao—were inoculated with representative strains of 15 Colletotrichum species (Table 3, 4). Pathogenicity tests followed the methods described by Montri et al. (2009) and Mongkolporn et al. (2010). Healthy, ripe red and green chili fruits were surface sterilized in 1% NaClO for 5 minutes, washed with sterile distilled water, and air dried. Each fruit received 1 μL of a conidial suspension (1 × 10^6 conidia/mL) injected onto the non-wounded surface using a microsyringe. Control fruits were treated with distilled water. Each isolate was tested on five replicate fruits, which were incubated in a moist chamber at 28 °C and monitored daily for symptoms over 9 days. Virulence and pathotype evaluations were conducted as described by Montri et al. (2009), with the experiment repeated twice.
Multi-locus phylogenetic analyses were performed on the 121 representative isolates from chili (Table 2a–c). The trees generated from Bayesian and RaxML analyses were consistent with the MP analysis (Fig. 2). In Fig. 2, the 31 isolates in the C. gloeosporioides complex clustered into eight clades: eight with C. fructicola, 13 with C. gloeosporioides, and four with C. aenigma, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, and C. viniferum. Two distinct lineages, clustering distantly from known species, were recognized as new species: C. conoides and C. grossum. In Fig. 3, isolates of the C. acutatum complex clustered into two clades, with 31 associated with C. scovillei and 17 with C. fioriniae. In the group of Colletotrichum species with curved conidia, 33 isolates clustered with C. truncatum, and one with C. incanum. The remaining isolates were assigned to C. cliviae and C. karstii. A new lineage, distinct from all known species, is described as C. liaoningense.
All tested isolates, except for C. endophytica, were pathogenic to most detached ripe red chili fruits (Table 3). All Capsicum annuum and C. frutescens cultivars were susceptible to all tested Colletotrichum species (except C. endophytica), with disease scores ranging from 5 to 9. Capsicum chinense was susceptible to most species, except C. cliviae CAUOS5, C. endophytica CAUG28, and C. hymenocallidis.
Most strains were found to be highly susceptible, with average scores of 7. Three pathotypes (PC1-R, PC2-R, and PC3-R) were identified based on three differential reactions of the tested strains with Capsicum chinense cv. Huangdijiao, C. annuum, and C. frutescens (see Table 3). The host reactions of the mature green fruit were similar to those of the ripe fruit (see Table 4). Like the ripe fruit, all three cultivars of mature green fruit of Capsicum annuum—Zidantou, Denglongjiao, and Sanyingjiao—were susceptible to all tested Colletotrichum species, except for C. endophytica, with average scores ranging from 5 to 6. Most of the Capsicum frutescens cultivars and C. chinense cv. Huangdijiao at the green fruit stage were susceptible to most isolates, except for C. aenigma CAUG26, C. conoides CAUG17, C. gloeosporioides CAUG2, C. grossum CAUG7, C. fructicola CAUG1, and C. karstii CAUGS1. Five pathotypes were identified based on the differential reactions with Xiaomila, Shuangla, and Huangdijiao (see Table 4). All pathogenic isolates formed sunken, brown to dark lesions on the fruits, and no symptoms developed on the negative controls.
To determine the prevalence of Colletotrichum species associated with chili in China, sample locations and the number of isolates were assessed for each species. Isolates with highly similar morphology and ITS sequences to those of the ex-type of C. truncatum appeared to be the most common (N = 422), representing 33% of all isolates and present in 56% of all sampling locations (see Fig. 5). All 34 isolates chosen from this group for multi-locus phylogenetic analysis were confirmed to be C. truncatum (see Fig. 4). It appears that C. truncatum is the most prevalent species of Colletotrichum on chili in China. The next most prevalent species included C. scovillei, C. gloeosporioides, C. fioriniae, and C. fructicola, which accounted for 21%, 14%, 14%, and 13% of all isolates, respectively. The remaining species were detected in less than 3% of the sampling locations.
Based on morphology and multi-locus phylogeny, the 121 isolates were assigned to 15 species. Seven species (C. aenigma, C. cliviae, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, C. incanum, C. karstii, and C. viniferum) were reported from chili for the first time. Three additional species (C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, and C. scovillei) were reported for the first time in China, along with three newly described species.
Colletotrichum conoides Y.Z. Diao, C. Zhang, L. Cai & X.L. Liu, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB812003; see Fig. 7.
Etymology: The name refers to the host variety (Capsicum annuum var. conoides) from which the fungus was first collected.
Colony characteristics on PDA included a diameter of 53–55 mm after 4 days at 28 °C, with greyish-white aerial mycelia and a light to medium grey reverse with a white margin. Chlamydospores were not observed. Vegetative hyphae were hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. No conidiomata or setae were observed. Conidiophores formed directly on the aerial mycelium, were hyaline, and aseptate. Conidiogenous cells were hyaline, cylindrical to clavate (22–30 × 3.5–5 µm), with openings measuring 2.5–3 µm. Conidia were hyaline, aseptate, smooth-walled, cylindrical to clavate with obtusely rounded ends, containing granular contents that were mostly evenly distributed (13–17.5 × 5–6.5 µm; average = 15.9 × 5.9 µm), with an L/W ratio of 2.7. Appressoria were single or in small groups, medium to dark brown, aseptate, mostly ellipsoidal to irregular in outline, and crenate or deeply lobed at the margin (4–11.5 × 6–10.5 µm; average = 8.35 × 7.1 µm), with an L/W ratio of 1.2. The sexual morph was not observed after 8 weeks.
Notes: Colletotrichum conoides is phylogenetically most closely related to C. hebeiense (Fig. 2). Sequence data from ITS and CHS-1 could not separate the two species, but they can be distinguished by GAPDH (12 bp), ACT (4 bp), or TUB (3 bp). The two species also differ in several characteristics: the granules in the conidia of C. conoides are uniformly distributed, whereas they are mostly located at the polar ends in C. hebeiense. Most appressoria of C. conoides are ovoid ellipsoidal with crenate or deeply lobed margins, while those of C. hebeiense are clavate to subglobose. Additionally, conidia of C. conoides are slightly larger than those of C. hebeiense (13–17.5 × 5–6.5 µm vs 11.6–15.3 × 4.47–6.88 µm). C. conoides was described from Capsicum annuum var. conoides, whereas C. hebeiense was described from Vitis vinifera (Yan et al. 2015). A PHI test revealed no significant recombination event between C. conoides and C. hebeiense (Fig. 8).
Colletotrichum grossum Y.Z. Diao, C. Zhang, L. Cai & X.L. Liu, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB812006; Fig. 9.
Etymology: Referring to the host variety (Capsicum annuum var. grossum) from which the fungus was first collected. Colonies on PDA attain 49–52 mm in diameter in 4 days at 28 °C; aerial mycelia are white, with a light grey reverse and a white margin. Chlamydospores were not observed. The vegetative hyphae are hyaline, smooth-walled, septate, and branched. Conidiomata and setae were not observed. Conidiophores are formed directly on the aerial mycelium, hyaline, and aseptate. Conidiogenous cells are hyaline, cylindrical to clavate, measuring 22–32 × 3–3.5 µm, with openings of 2–2.5 µm. Conidia are hyaline, aseptate, smooth-walled, cylindrical to clavate, with both ends rounded or one end acute; the contents are granular and mostly located at the polar ends, measuring 14.5–20.5 × 5–7.5 µm (average = 16.8 × 6.3 µm), with an L/W ratio of 2.7. Appressoria are single, medium brown, aseptate, mostly ovoid or ellipsoidal to irregular in outline, with crenate margins, measuring 5.5–11.5 × 4–10.5 µm (average = 8.65 × 6.1 µm), and an L/W ratio of 1.4. The sexual morph has not been observed after 8 weeks.
Specimen examined: CHINA, Hainan Province, Haikou city, on chili fruits (Capsicum annuum var. grossum), October 2010, Y.Z. Diao (holotype HMAS 246480, ex-type living culture CGMCC3.17614 = CAUG7 = LC6227); additional specimens include HN2 (living culture CAUG31) and HN3 (living culture CAUG32).
Notes: Colletotrichum grossum is phylogenetically most closely related to C. theobromicola (Fig. 2). The sequence data of ITS and CAL do not separate the two species, but they can be distinguished by GAPDH (3 bp), ACT (5 bp), and TUB (8 bp). Morphologically, C. grossum differs from C. theobromicola by having wider conidia (14.5–20.5 × 5–7.5 µm vs 14.5–18.7 × 4.5–5.5 µm) and colonies that are flat white rather than black, as seen in C. theobromicola (Rojas et al. 2010). A PHI test revealed no significant recombination event between C. grossum and C. theobromicola (Fig. 8).
Fig. 2: This figure displays a maximum parsimony tree of isolates in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex. The analysis was obtained from a heuristic search combining gene sequences from ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB2. Colletotrichum boninense served as the outgroup. Bootstrap support values of 50% or greater and Bayesian posterior probabilities of 0.95 or higher are shown at the nodes. The tree length is 1665, with a consistency index (CI) of 0.672, retention index (RI) of 0.889, relative completeness (RC) of 0.597, and homoplasy index (HI) of 0.328. Ex-type strains are emphasized in bold.
A collection of Colletotrichum species isolates was analyzed for their anthracnose severity scores on a 0–9 scale across seven chili cultivars at the ripe red fruit stage. The isolates included various species such as C. aenigma, C. cliviae, C. conoides, C. endophytica, C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. grossum, C. hymenocallidis, C. incanum, C. karstii, C. liaoningense, C. scovillei, C. truncatum, and C. viniferum.
The table provides a detailed summary of the anthracnose severity scores for each isolate across the seven chili cultivars: Chaotianjiao, Denglongjiao, Sanyingjiao, Zidantou, Shuanla, Xiaomila, and Huangdijiao. Each row corresponds to a specific isolate and lists its mean severity score for each chili cultivar, along with the identified pathotype. For instance, C. aenigma (CAUG26) shows a mean score of 6, indicating moderate susceptibility across the cultivars, whereas C. endophytica (CAUG28) scored 0 across all cultivars, reflecting no observed disease severity. The highest mean scores were recorded for isolates such as C. liaoningense (CAUOS2) with scores of 9, indicating a significant level of anthracnose severity, particularly on specific cultivars.
Additionally, a maximum parsimony tree of the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex was constructed using various gene sequences, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides as the outgroup. The tree demonstrates the relationships among isolates, with bootstrap support values and Bayesian posterior probabilities displayed at the nodes, highlighting the phylogenetic structure of these isolates.
Table 4 presents the anthracnose severity scores for 15 isolates of Colletotrichum species on a scale of 0 to 9, evaluated at the mature green fruit stage across seven chili cultivars. The cultivars examined include Capsicum annuum, C. frutescens, and C. chinense. Each isolate's mean severity score is listed alongside its pathotype. The scores reflect the disease severity observed in specific cultivars: for instance, C. fioriniae (CAUT34) shows high severity scores of 9 across multiple cultivars, indicating its aggressive nature. In contrast, C. endophytica (CAUG28) displays a score of 0, suggesting no disease symptoms. The pathotype classification (e.g., PC1-G, PC2-G) further categorizes the isolates based on their pathogenicity.
C. cliviae (CBS 125375), C. cliviae (CSSS1), C. cliviae (CSSS2), C. dracaenophilum (CBS 118199), C. yunnanense (CBS 132135), C. tropicicola (BCC 38877), C. tropicicola (MFLUCC 100167), C. thailandicum (BCC 38879), C. thailandicum (MFLUCC 100192), Monilochaetes infuscans (CBS 869.96).
Fig. 6 shows the maximum parsimony tree of isolates of Colletotrichum species in the fourth group, obtained from a heuristic search of combined ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, ITS, and TUB2 gene sequences. Monilochaetes infuscans was used as the outgroup. Bootstrap support values of ≥ 50% and Bayesian posterior probability values of ≥ 0.95 are indicated at the nodes. The tree length is 2913, with a consistency index (CI) of 0.717, a retention index (RI) of 0.870, a composite index (RC) of 0.624, and a homoplasy index (HI) of 0.283. Ex-type strains are emphasized in bold.
Fig. 7 presents Colletotrichum conoides (CAUG17) with images showing: a-b. Colonies on PDA (both above and below); c. conidiophores; d-e, g-h: appressoria; f. conidia. Scale bars for images c-h are 10 μm.
Fig. 8 illustrates the results of the pairwise homoplasy index (PHI) test of closely related species using both LogDet transformation and splits decomposition. PHI test results (Φw) < 0.05 indicate significant recombination within the dataset.
Colletotrichum liaoningense Y.Z. Diao, C. Zhang, L. Cai, & X.L. Liu, sp. nov. — MycoBank MB812007; Fig. 10. Etymology refers to the province in China where the fungus was first collected. In China, C. truncatum has been reported to cause significant damage to chili production in Australia, China, India, Thailand, and other countries (Poonpolgul & Kumphai 2007; Than et al. 2008; Sharma et al. 2014; Diao et al. 2015).
Colonies on PDA reach 48–51 mm in diameter in 4 days at 28 °C; aerial mycelia are light grey, while the reverse is medium to dark brown with a white margin. Chlamydospores were not observed. Vegetative hyphae are hyaline and smooth-walled, with smooth-walled septate setae. The conidiomata are verruculose. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has been reported to infect chili in various countries (Shin et al. 1999; Kim et al. 2008; Than et al. 2008).
A recent study revealed this taxon to be a species complex comprising many morphologically similar taxa (Weir et al. 2012). Therefore, this new classification system necessitates a re-investigation of species in the C. gloeosporioides species complex on chili, as species in this complex exhibit biological and physiological differences. In the current study, C. gloeosporioides s.str. and C. fructicola were found to be the most prevalent, representing 47% and 42% of the isolates, respectively (Fig. 2).
Colletotrichum fructicola was originally isolated from coffee berries (Prihastuti et al. 2009) and has since been found on a wide range of host plants (Weir et al.).
Specimen examined: CHINA, Xingcheng city, Liaoning Province, on chili.
Colletotrichum liaoningense is phylogenetically most closely related to C. brevisporum (Fig. 6). The sequence data from ITS and ACT could not separate the two species; however, they can be distinguished from each other via GAPDH (10 bp) or TUB (12 bp). The granules are equally distributed in the conidia of C. liaoningense but are mostly present at the polar ends in the conidia of C. brevisporum. The appressoria of C. liaoningense are smaller than those of C. brevisporum (3.5–5 × 2.5–4.5 µm vs. 10–13 × 8–11 µm) (Noireung et al. 2012). A PHI test revealed no significant recombination event between C. liaoningense and C. brevisporum (Fig. 8).
Colletotrichum acutatum is a commonly reported species that causes anthracnose on numerous plants worldwide (Damm et al. 2012a). It was originally described from Carica papaya, Capsicum frutescens, and Delphinium ajacis in Australia (Simmonds 1965) but has since been reported to infect chili in almost all pepper-growing countries, such as Australia, China, India, Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, and the USA (Than et al. 2008). Colletotrichum truncatum, the most frequently isolated species in this study, has been reported from more than 460 plant species (Farr & Rossman 2016).
The failure to isolate Colletotrichum species from certain regions in China might be explained by the high latitude and climatic conditions affecting pathogen distribution. The current study represents the most intensive investigation of Colletotrichum species on chili in China, revealing 15 species, with the dominant species being C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum.
Additionally, pathogenicity tests confirmed that all obtained species from chili were pathogenic, except for C. endophytica. Originally reported as an endophytic fungus in tropical grasses (Manamgoda et al. 2013), C. endophytica did not exhibit pathogenicity to any chili cultivars tested, further underlining its possible endophytic nature.
The content includes discussions about various species of Colletotrichum affecting chili plants, highlighting their phylogenetic relationships, pathogenicity, and geographical distribution. If there was a specific table referenced, please let me know, and I can provide a detailed description of its contents.
