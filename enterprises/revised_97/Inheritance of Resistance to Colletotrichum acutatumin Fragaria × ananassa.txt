Denoyes-Rothan, B., Guérin, G., Lerceteau-Köhler, E., and Risser, G. 2005. Inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum in Fragaria × ananassa. Phytopathology 95:405-412.
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, is a major disease affecting the octoploid cultivated strawberry, Fragaria × ananassa. The inheritance of high and intermediate levels of plant resistance to C. acutatum (pathogenicity group 2) was investigated using an 8 × 8 factorial design. A single dominant gene (Rca2) was found to control high-level resistance.
Colletotrichum acutatum is particularly significant in Europe, where it is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. × ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.
The objective of this study was to investigate the inheritance of high and intermediate plant resistance to C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 2 to enhance understanding of anthracnose resistance. An 8 × 8 factorial design was employed, focusing on analyzing the disease's intermediate resistance, indicating that minor genes may also contribute to resistance in certain cultivars, such as Belrubi. The intermediate level of resistance was found to be quantitative and governed by minor genes. Analyzing 26 genotypes and cultivars from Fragaria spp. revealed that the dominant gene is not rare in the germplasm of F. × ananassa, and anthracnose resistance is also present in other Fragaria species. These findings hold significant implications for breeding efforts aimed at enhancing anthracnose resistance.

Plant Material. In a preliminary study, four crosses (Valeta × Selva, Addie × Sequoia, and their reciprocal crosses Selva × Valeta and Sequoia × Addie) were examined to test reciprocal effects. Since all these crosses segregated clearly in a 1:1 ratio (P > 0.05), a factorial scheme was chosen for studying the inheritance of anthracnose resistance. By using different parents as female and male, this scheme allows for the analysis of a broader genetic base compared to that of a diallel design. The 16 cultivars used in the factorial crossing scheme (8 × 8) were assigned randomly as male or female parents. Table 1 summarizes the authors credited with reporting the resistance of these cultivars in the literature, along with the levels of resistance according to preliminary or reported results. The inheritance of resistance in cv. Addie was studied by inoculating it with C. acutatum S2 families derived from the selfing of random individuals taken from the S1 generation.
The presence of anthracnose resistance to pathogenicity group 2 was evaluated by inoculating 26 accessions, including 23 F. × ananassa genotypes of various geographic origins, one F. moschata genotype (FM1), and two F. vesca genotypes (Reine des Vallées and Rodluvan). Finally, the presence of identical or different genes controlling anthracnose resistance in cvs. Capitola and Chandler was analyzed by studying families derived from the complex cross [(Capitola × Chandler) × Pajaro].
Crosses (F1, first filial generation) and selfings (S1, selfing parental generation, and S2, selfing S1 generation) were protected from cross-pollination by covering buds with polyethylene bags.
Seeds were germinated in the greenhouse with a 16-hour photoperiod using supplementary incandescent light, maintaining a day temperature of 24 ± 6°C and a night temperature of 18 ± 4°C. Four to six weeks after sowing, seedlings were transplanted into 72-cell plug trays (one plant per 5 × 5 cm well) containing a peat/vermiculite substrate (1:1 by volume).
Inoculations. The monoconidial isolate 688b of the C. acutatum pathogenicity group 2 was used for inoculum. The stock culture was maintained in cryoconservation. Each year, this strain was recovered from diseased plants of cv. Elsanta to revive its pathogenicity.
Seedlings were inoculated when the first two true leaves were fully developed, approximately 3 to 4 weeks after planting in the tray. Inoculation was performed by spraying the leaf surfaces until runoff with a conidial suspension adjusted to 3 × 10^6 conidia per milliliter. After inoculation, the seedlings were maintained in plastic boxes for two weeks in a controlled environment growth chamber with a 14-hour photoperiod at 28°C ± 1°C, followed by another two weeks in a greenhouse at 25°C ± 4°C. The humidity inside the plastic chamber was maintained at 90 to 95% for at least one week after inoculation.
Table 1 describes the parental lines, including their pedigrees, geographic origins, resistance reactions, references on resistance to anthracnose, and their status in the factorial crossing scheme. The table lists various cultivars such as Addie, Arking, Belrubi, Chandler, Darestival, and others, alongside the respective resistance reactions classified as resistant (R), susceptible (S), or intermediate (I). It includes references that provide evidence of resistance to anthracnose, indicating that different cultivars exhibit varying levels of resistance based on documented research. The origins of these cultivars span several countries, including the USA, the Netherlands, and Japan.
Cultivars were rated as S (susceptible), I (intermediate), and R (resistant) based on preliminary inoculations, following Denoyes-Rothan and Guérin (8). The references for reported resistance for each corresponding cultivar are included.
In the factorial crossing scheme, "Female" or "Male" designations are indicated.
Table 2 details the segregation of 26 S1 populations from various genotypes or cultivars regarding their reaction to Colletotrichum acutatum, pathogenicity group 2. The genotypes or cultivars listed include US70, US159, US292, and US438, which have been reported as resistant according to Galetta et al. (11). Underlined genotypes serve as controls.
Very Susceptible (VS), with responses from 3 to 5.
These notations are evaluated 28 days post-inoculation. All ratios represent the number of resistant (R) plants compared to the total of moderately susceptible and very susceptible (MS + VS) plants. The probability of the chi-square test is calculated for expected ratios of 3:1, as well as for goodness of fit with likelihood chi-square tests based on expected ratios of 1:0 and 0:1.
Very Susceptible group [VS] (responses from 3 to 5, indicating wilting due to crown rot).
Experimental Design: In the study using an 8 × 8 factorial design, at least 80 seedlings were inoculated for each of the 64 crosses and for the S1 progeny of the 16 parents. Exceptions included the crosses Darestival × Pajaro, Hokowase × Pajaro, Hokowase × Belrubi, Hokowase × Dover, as well as the S1 progenies of Elsanta and Rosanne, where 49, 44, 59, 78, 58, and 48 seedlings were inoculated, respectively. A total of five inoculation experiments were conducted, and most selfings or crosses were assessed in at least two distinct inoculation experiments. For studying the inheritance of 26 diverse accessions, at least 40 S1 seedlings were inoculated, with the exception of cv. Madame Moutot, which had 24 seedlings. To investigate the inheritance of the intermediate resistance of cv. Addie, one S1 and eight S2 progeny were inoculated.
Data Analysis: For analyzing segregation using a Mendelian approach, seedlings were classified into two groups: the resistant class (R), corresponding to [R], and the susceptible class (S), corresponding to [MS] and [VS]. Segregation ratios of S1 and cross populations were tested for goodness-of-fit to theoretical ratios, under the hypothesis that a single locus with one dominant allele controls resistance. Given that seedlings may escape inoculation (with a mean of 3% among the eight susceptible S1 cultivars: Yolo, Elsanta, Darestival, Pajaro, Fern, Hokowase, Valeta, and HummiGento) or die from causes other than anthracnose, segregation ratios of 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) and 1:0 (resistant/susceptible) were tested as 3:97 (resistant/susceptible) and 97:3 (resistant/susceptible). Tests were conducted on the segregating populations using numerical data. The chi-square (χ²) test was employed for the segregation ratios of 3:1 and 1:1, while the likelihood ratio chi-square test (G²) (SAS Institute, Cary, NC), suitable for a small number of observations (3), was used for the segregation ratios of 0:1 and 1:0 (3:97 and 97:3, respectively).
To compare the disease incidence means of S1 and crosses derived from susceptible or moderately susceptible parents, a least-squares means (LS means) test (P = 0.001) was performed. This test was also used for comparing the eight S2 populations derived from cv. Addie with the three S1 populations derived from cvs. Addie, Elsanta, and Dover. All analyses were performed using the Statistical Analysis System (SAS Institute).
Factorial Crossing Scheme: In the five inoculation experiments, the S1 progeny of the susceptible control cv. Pajaro exhibited a high percentage of susceptible seedlings, ranging from 96% to 100% (P from the homogeneity of χ² test = 0.56), indicating optimal conditions for disease development. Consequently, data obtained from different experiments were pooled for analysis for each population.
Frequency Distributions: Frequency distributions of anthracnose disease responses appeared to be bimodal, except for Addie-S1, HummiGento-S1, and four intercrosses between susceptible cultivars and Addie (Darestival × Addie, HummiGento × Addie, Hokowase × Addie, and Valeta × Addie). These six distributions displayed large percentages of moderately susceptible plants (MS > 20%).
Major Dominant Gene for Resistance: The S1 progeny from the five resistant cultivars—Arking, Chandler, Rosanne, Selva, and Sequoia—showed clear segregation in a 3:1 (resistant/susceptible) ratio with P > 0.05, suggesting control by a single heterozygous dominant locus. This was further confirmed by analyzing the segregation of the 22 crosses between these resistant cultivars and susceptible ones, which segregated 1:1 (P > 0.05; for three crosses, P > 0.01, except for Arking × Pajaro and Rosanne × Fern [P < 0.001 and P = 0.004, respectively]). Additionally, six intercrosses between resistant cultivars also segregated in a 3:1 ratio (P > 0.05, except for Chandler × Selva [P = 0.002]).
In the simplest hypothesis of a multidose configuration in the cultivar Dover, specifically regarding double dose, the segregation of the resistance gene is analyzed in disomic (RR rr rr rr), tetrasomic (RRrr rrrr), and octosomic (RRrrrrrr) configurations through test crosses (crosses with susceptible genotypes) and selfing. The results, summarized in Table 5, do not support the hypothesis of octosomic inheritance of the resistance gene Rca2, as the probabilities of the χ² test were lower than 0.05, except for the cross between HummiGento and Dover. The observed segregation patterns align with ratios typical of disomic and/or tetrasomic inheritance, depending on the specific crosses.
The segregation pattern observed in Belrubi-S1, which exhibited a percentage of resistant seedlings at 84.4%, does not conform to either a 3:1 or a 1:0 ratio (P < 0.001). When considering the hypothesis of a single heterozygous dominant gene, an excess of resistant genotypes was noted in Belrubi-S1 and in five crosses between this cultivar and susceptible cultivars (as detailed in Table 4). However, three crosses involving this cultivar and resistant cultivars displayed clear segregation in a 3:1 (resistant/susceptible) ratio with P > 0.05.
Regarding the absence of resistance, the S1 progenies from susceptible parental cultivars, including Darestival, Elsanta, Fern, Hokowase, HummiGento, Pajaro, Valeta, and Yolo, showed very low percentages of resistant genotypes (ranging from 0.0 to 8.8%, with an average of 3%) (refer to Table 3). This result aligns well with the hypothesis of a segregation ratio of 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) with P > 0.05. The populations derived from intercrosses among these cultivars maintained the same ratio, thereby supporting the hypothesis of the absence of a dominant gene.
For partial resistance, the observed segregation pattern in Addie-S1 did not fit a 0:1, 3:1, or even a 1:3 ratio as expected with a recessive simplex heterozygous gene (P < 0.01) (see Table 3). Its frequency of disease response showed a continuous distribution when compared to the susceptible and resistant controls (Fig. 1), indicating the presence of partial resistance.
Using the LS mean test, the mean disease responses of populations from Addie-S1, HummiGento × Addie, Hokowase × Addie, and Valeta × Addie were significantly lower (ranging from 3.3 to 3.0) than the disease responses from selfing populations of susceptible cultivars (Darestival, Elsanta, Fern, Hokowase, Pajaro, and Yolo) and lower than the intercrosses among these cultivars (from 5.0 to 3.9) (refer to Table 3). Moreover, disease responses from five out of eight Addie-S2 families (Addie4-S2, Addie29-S2, Addie17-S2, Addie13-S2, and Addie9-S2) were significantly lower than those from Addie-S1 and comparable to those of Dover (P = 0.001) (see Table 6). These findings suggest that the partial resistance in cultivar Addie is likely under oligogenic control.
The inheritance of anthracnose resistance to pathogenicity group 2 across 26 accessions is detailed in Table 2, which reports disease response segregations for the S1 progenies. The segregation ratios of S1 families from cultivars Capitola, Gariguette, Mamie, Mara des Bois, Madame Moutot, Osogrande, Revada, Senga Sengana, and Seascape, along with genotypes US438, US70, and F. moschata FM1, were statistically similar to the segregation ratio of Sequoia-S1, consistent with the hypothesis that a heterozygous locus controls the high level of resistance. The segregation ratios from S1 families of genotypes US159 and US292 and both genotypes of ...
In order to determine if the dominant locus controlling high levels of resistance is the same in the resistant genotypes, a study was conducted using two cultivars, Capitola and Chandler, both of which are heterozygous for the resistance locus. Firstly, cv. Capitola was crossed with cv. Chandler, and then individuals from this progeny were crossed with the homozygous susceptible cv. Pajaro. Under the hypothesis that the resistance gene is the same in both Capitola and Chandler, families from the crosses [(Capitola × Chandler) × Pajaro] would show segregation ratios of 1:0 (resistant/susceptible), 1:1 (resistant/susceptible), and 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) in 25%, 50%, and 25% of the families, respectively. Conversely, if the resistance gene differs between the two cultivars, families from the crosses would segregate with ratios of 3:1 (resistant/susceptible), 1:1 (resistant/susceptible), and 0:1 (resistant/susceptible) for 25%, 50%, and 25% of the families, respectively. Among the 21 families analyzed from the crosses [(Capitola × Chandler) × Pajaro], nine families exhibited a 0:1 ratio, 11 families a 1:1 ratio, and one family a 1:0 ratio, supporting the hypothesis of the same major gene in both Capitola and Chandler (P = 0.05).
This study reports the inheritance of plant resistance to pathogenicity group 2 of Colletotrichum acutatum, the causative agent of anthracnose disease in strawberries, according to the level of resistance. A major dominant gene controls the high level of resistance, which is determined by a single dominant gene. This dominant resistance gene was widely present in a collection of European cultivars studied, including Mamie, Gariguette, and Belrubi, as well as in U.S. cultivars like Sequoia, Dover, and US159. The narrow genetic basis of cultivated strawberries suggests that very few sources of resistance are involved, aligning with the observation of resistance being controlled by the same gene in Capitola and Chandler. Other species of Fragaria have also displayed resistance to C. acutatum, as seen in two genotypes of F. vesca and one of F. moschata. Anthracnose resistance has additionally been noted in F. chiloensis and F. virginiana (J. L. Maas, personal communication). Further studies on molecular markers are needed.

Probability values (P) indicate the significance of the chi-square tests used to calculate expected ratios, revealing insights into genetic resistance mechanisms.
The study suggests that monogenic resistance aligns with previous findings indicating qualitative inheritance of resistance to Colletotrichum acutatum. However, it did not specify the effectiveness against pathogenicity group 2 of the fungus. Other studies propose that genetic resistance may exhibit quantitative inheritance due to variability in pathogenicity among isolates.
Despite the complexity associated with octoploid strawberries, which typically show regular diploid bivalent pairing during meiosis, Mendelian inheritance patterns have been observed in traits like phosphoglucose isomerase allozymes, sex expression, and photo-insensitivity. Future research could clarify whether the major resistance gene behaves disomically or polysomically by examining multidose resistance genes or mapping resistance genes within the strawberry genome.
Minor genes control an intermediate level of resistance. This intermediate level, observed in the cultivar Addie, is quantitative and regulated by a complex of minor genes. In cv. Addie, these minor genes may exhibit partial dominance, as demonstrated by three crosses between cv. Addie and susceptible cultivars, which showed similar segregation patterns in the Addie-S1 progeny. Furthermore, the excess of resistant seedlings in progenies from crosses between cv. Belrubi and susceptible cultivars—compared to the 50% expected from the control of a single dominant gene—supports the presence of minor genes with partial dominance in cv. Belrubi.
In cv. Addie, the transgressive lines of S2 exhibit a higher level of resistance than the Addie-S1 progeny, indicating that the intermediate level of resistance could be advantageous in breeding programs aimed at anthracnose resistance. Additionally, this quantitative resistance is anticipated to function in a non-race-specific manner, providing durable resistance as suggested by Van der Plank. This is consistent with the effectiveness of cv. Addie’s resistance against isolates from both pathogenicity groups, as noted by B. Denoyes-Rothan (unpublished data).
Regarding the correlation with fruit resistance, a comparison of the resistance genotype identified in seedlings with the fruit resistance previously described by Denoyes-Rothan et al. revealed that all genotypes possessing the dominant gene (either homozygous or heterozygous) and cv. Addie—known for its minor genes—displayed intermediate or high levels of fruit resistance. In contrast, all genotypes lacking the dominant resistance allele, with the exception of cv. Selva, did not exhibit any fruit resistance. Therefore, it appears that fruit resistance is partially controlled by the dominant gene, but not exclusively.
Table 6 presents data on the partial resistance of cv. Addie to Colletotrichum acutatum, pathogenicity group 2. It includes various cultivars and their respective generations, indicating the number of plants tested and their classifications based on disease response. The cultivars are listed alongside their average resistance levels measured as a mean score, standard deviation (SD), and results from a least squares means test. The table ranks the cultivars according to their mean disease response, with notable differences in resistance levels observed among the S1 and S2 generations.
Table 7 summarizes the fruit resistance (disease incidence) and genotypes for plant resistance across 22 strawberry cultivars against Colletotrichum acutatum, pathogenicity group 2. It categorizes the cultivars into resistant and susceptible classes, with specific percentages indicating the incidence of fruit showing anthracnose lesions after inoculation. The table includes notations about the genotypes of the cultivars and their corresponding disease responses, showcasing a range from intermediate to susceptible levels of resistance.
Fruit can be classified into two categories based on the presence or absence of a lesion. Values that share the same letters do not differ significantly (P < 0.001) (8).
The plant resistance genotype is controlled by a dominant gene in a diploid configuration, which was deduced from inoculation of S1, except for cultivar Addie, which exhibited resistance governed by minor genes.
A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.
