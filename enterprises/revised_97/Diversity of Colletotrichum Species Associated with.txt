Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.
Countries in Asia and the Pacific region are major producers of tropical fruit crops, followed by Latin America, the Caribbean, and Africa. Minor producers include the United States and Oceania. Key tropical fruits include mango, pineapple, avocado, and papaya, with mango being the most significant in terms of global production. India is the leading producer of mango and papaya, followed by Thailand, Mexico, China, Brazil, and Indonesia. Minor tropical fruits comprise guava, longan, litchi, durian, passion fruit, rambutan, and mangosteen, with China and India being the largest producers.
Tropical fruit crops are susceptible to infection by Colletotrichum species, which typically cause anthracnose. The anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops is summarized in Figure 1. Infection often occurs in the fields during the flowering and fruiting stages. Various factors, including humidity, temperature, fruit condition, and inoculum concentration, can influence Colletotrichum infection.
Host infection begins with the germination of conidia, followed by the formation of appressoria and penetration pegs, which are specialized fungal structures that facilitate penetration into host tissues. In some instances, direct penetration occurs through wounds or natural openings.
After infection, many anthracnose pathogens enter a state of quiescence or latency, a characteristic commonly seen in pathogens causing postharvest diseases, including Colletotrichum. During this latent period, anthracnose pathogens remain dormant within host tissues until conditions become favorable for disease development.
Figure 1 illustrates the anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops, drawn by Latiffah Zakaria. Anthracnose pathogens infect not only fruits but also other plant organs, including leaves, flowers, twigs, and branches. The conidia and spores formed in these infected tissues are released and dispersed during rainy days or periods of high humidity, becoming the primary inoculum for fruit infection at the preharvest stage. The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions that contain conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions can merge to form larger lesions. These dark lesions on the fruit surface are unattractive to consumers and significantly reduce the market value of the affected fruits. Figures 2A–E display anthracnose lesions on several tropical fruit crops.
Figure 2 shows anthracnose symptoms on various tropical fruit crops: (A) guava, (B) dragon fruit, (C) banana, (D) mango, and (E) papaya. These photographs were taken by Latiffah Zakaria and postgraduate students.
Prior to the application of molecular-based phylogenetic analysis using multiple markers for the taxonomic and systematic revision of Colletotrichum species, only two species—Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides—were reported to be associated with anthracnose symptoms in many tropical fruit crops. However, more recent phylogenetic analyses have established that these two species belong to two complexes known as “acutatum” and “gloeosporioides,” which include several other species. Table 1 summarizes the Colletotrichum species reported to be associated with anthracnose in tropical fruit crops across various countries. Many of these species were identified through phylogenetic analysis of multiple markers.
Numerous Colletotrichum species within these complexes are reported to cause anthracnose. Some species are known to infect specific hosts, while others can infect multiple hosts. Anthracnose pathogens capable of infecting multiple hosts may indicate the development of cross-infection abilities. Based on a cross-pathogenicity study by Phoulivong et al. (2012), several species within the C. gloeosporioides complex were found to have the capacity to infect multiple hosts. For example, C. asianum was detected in infected chili, mango, and rose apple, while C. fructicola, originally reported to infect coffee berries, is now recognized as a phytopathogen affecting other plant species such as chili, citrus fruits, rose apple, avocado, grapes, and papaya.
This table lists various species of Colletotrichum that have been identified in association with tropical fruit crops across different countries. For each fruit crop, the corresponding Colletotrichum species and the country of the report are provided, along with the references.
Omar (2001) [74], Amusa et al. (2005) [75], Keith and Zee (2010) [76], Weir et al. (2012) [13], Damm et al. (2012a) [12], Merida and Palmateer (2013) [77], Intan Sakinah et al. (2014) [78], Cruz et al. (2015) [79], Crous et al. (2015) [80], Sharma et al. (2015b) [81], and Bragança et al. (2016) [82] have all reported on C. gloeosporioides sensu lato in various contexts. For instance, in China, Yao et al. (2018) [83] also documented this species.
In the USA, studies by Nelson (2008) [84], Silva-Rojas and Avila-Quezada (2011) [85], Hunupolagama et al. (2015) [86], and Hernandez-Lauzardo et al. (2015) [87] noted the presence of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum.
In Turkey, Akgul et al. (2016) [88] identified C. alienum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense in Mersin Province.
Additional studies revealed a variety of Colletotrichum species, including C. aenigma, C. karstii, and others in different regions by Sharma et al. (2017) [91] and others through 2020.
Due to the economic importance of anthracnose in tropical fruit production and commercialization, this review focuses on the current knowledge regarding Colletotrichum species associated with tropical fruit crops reported in several fruit-producing countries. Emphasis is placed on species related to mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, as these crops significantly contribute to the economic well-being of their inhabitants.
Banana (Musa spp.) is one of the most important fruit crops globally, with over 100 billion bananas consumed annually [98]. More than 150 countries cultivate bananas, primarily in Asia, Latin America, and Africa, with India being the largest producer, followed by China, the Philippines, Ecuador, and Brazil [99]. The international banana trade mainly involves the Cavendish variety, which has replaced the Gros Michel due to its resistance to Fusarium wilt. Cavendish bananas are produced for both export and local consumption, grown in small farms and extensive plantations [100].
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum species, is a significant postharvest disease of bananas. These pathogens can infect banana plants in plantations and remain latent. Bananas are often harvested before ripening, and as they ripen during storage, anthracnose symptoms manifest as brown or black lesions. These lesions can enlarge, become sunken, and produce spore masses. Mechanical damage, such as wounds and scratches on the banana peel from handling and transportation, exacerbates the symptoms [101], severely affecting the quality of bananas for both export and local markets.
Colletotrichum musae has long been linked to banana anthracnose worldwide [23,102–107]. Besides anthracnose, it can also cause stem-end, crown, and blossom-end rots in bananas [108]. Given its prevalence, Vieira et al. (2017) [23] proposed that this species may be host-specific to bananas; however, a comprehensive global study is necessary to confirm this hypothesis.
The use of a single fungal species for study can lead to cost savings compared to sequencing multiple genes. A study by Li et al. (2019) identified Colletotrichum musae as one of the species associated with mango anthracnose, suggesting that Colletotrichum species may not be host-specific to bananas as previously thought. Among the main banana-producing countries, detailed studies on anthracnose pathogens have primarily been conducted in Brazil, where five species were identified as associated with the disease. Colletotrichum musae remains the most prevalent species reported in Brazil. Information on Colletotrichum species causing banana anthracnose in India, China, the Philippines, and Ecuador is limited. The available data mostly consist of disease reports or newly recorded species, with only one or two species commonly noted.
The species causing banana anthracnose in Brazil include C. siamense, C. tropicale, C. chrysophilum, and C. theobromicola. Additionally, C. scovillei was reported in China, C. siamense in India and Turkey, C. gloeosporioides in Ecuador, and C. chrysophilum in Mexico. Other reported species include C. paxtonii, C. karstii, and C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, along with an undescribed species in the C. siamense sensu lato clade. One reason for the lack of comprehensive studies on banana anthracnose may be the focus on other diseases that significantly affect banana yields, such as wilt caused by Fusarium oxysporum Tropical Race 4 and Moko disease caused by Ralstonia solanacearum.
Mango (Mangifera indica L.) is predominantly cultivated in Asia, especially in India, which accounts for approximately 50% of the world's mango production, followed by China, Thailand, Pakistan, and Indonesia. In the Americas, Brazil and Mexico are the largest mango producers, while Nigeria and Egypt are significant producers in Africa. For many of these countries, mango production holds considerable economic importance. Almost all mango cultivars grown in these regions are susceptible to anthracnose due to the high temperatures and humidity typical of tropical climates. The incidence of fruit anthracnose can reach nearly 100% under wet conditions.
Mango anthracnose affects not only the fruit but also the leaves, twigs, and flowers. Leaf symptoms include black necrotic spots with irregular shapes on both sides of the leaves, which can also appear on twigs and flowers. These spots may merge to form larger infected areas. Infected tissues eventually dry out, leading to the death of the affected plant parts.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato is a significant pathogen responsible for mango anthracnose globally. In some cases, C. acutatum sensu lato has also been linked to the disease. Phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences reveal that C. gloeosporioides comprises diverse groups or sub-populations, suggesting that other Colletotrichum species may also be associated with mango anthracnose. Studies indicate that Colletotrichum isolates from mango can consist of pathogenically and genetically distinct populations of C. gloeosporioides. According to Ploetz (1999), the C. gloeosporioides population on mango has a restricted host range and is highly virulent solely on mango. Following the phylogenetic analyses of the Colletotrichum genus by Phoulivong et al. (2012) and Weir et al. (2012), several species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes, including C. gloeosporioides, have been associated with mango anthracnose.
In 2021, data on anthracnose-causing agents in mangoes have been communicated as first reports or disease notes. In northeastern Brazil, five species of Colletotrichum were identified as anthracnose pathogens in mangoes: C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. tropicale, C. karstii, and C. dianesei. All these species were reported for the first time in mangoes in Brazil. Multiple genetic markers, including glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), actin, β-tubulin, calmodulin, glutamine synthetase (GS), and the ITS region, were used to identify these species. Interestingly, only C. karstii could not infect two mango cultivars, Keith and Palmer, in a pathogenicity test conducted by Lima et al. (2015), suggesting that preference for certain mango cultivars may exist among Colletotrichum species. However, these authors found no host specificity in a cross-pathogenicity test that included papaya, banana, guava, and bell pepper, indicating that these species have a broad host range.
Pardo-De la Hoz et al. (2016) reported some level of host preference among Colletotrichum spp. associated with mango anthracnose in Colombia, which included C. asianum and C. gloeosporioides. Both species have also been reported as common mango anthracnose pathogens by Rojas et al. (2010) in Panama and Krishnapillai and Wijeratnam (2014) in Sri Lanka. Many reports published in India, the largest mango producer in the world, point out C. gloeosporioides as the main causative agent of mango anthracnose; however, this might not always be accurate. Based on restriction analysis and sequencing of the ITS region, Chowdappa and Kumar (2012) reported that C. gloeosporioides associated with mango anthracnose in India comprises diverse subgroups. Pathogenicity tests demonstrate variation in the degree of virulence among C. gloeosporioides isolates, suggesting the existence of more than one species causing the disease. Using multigene phylogenetic analysis, Sharma et al. (2013) later identified four phylogenetic species: C. fragariae sensu stricto, C. fructicola, C. jasmine-sambac, and C. melanocaulon. Additionally, five Colletotrichum lineages without species names were associated with mango anthracnose in India. Sharma et al. also reported that none of the Colletotrichum isolates obtained from mango samples grouped with C. gloeosporioides sensu stricto, aligning with findings previously documented by Phoulivong et al. (2012).
A multigene phylogenetic analysis carried out by Mo et al. (2018) in various parts of Guangxi, southern China, revealed that three species of the C. gloeosporioides complex are pathogenic to mango fruits and leaves. These species were identified as C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense. Later, Qin et al. (2017) reported C. scovillei, a species within the C. acutatum complex, as another anthracnose-causing pathogen in mango leaves in Guangxi, China. Among species in the C. gloeosporioides complex, C. asianum is the most common anthracnose pathogen in mangoes worldwide. This species has been reported in Brazil, Sri Lanka, Sanya City, and other areas of China, as well as in South Africa, Malaysia, Taiwan, Mexico, the Philippines, and Indonesia.
Wu et al. (2020) reported on Colletotrichum spp. associated with mango anthracnose in Taiwan. They identified C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, C. tropicale, and C. scovillei, some of which were previously recognized by Li et al. (2019) in China. A comprehensive study of mango anthracnose was also conducted by Tovar-Pedraza et al. (2020) in Mexico. In this study, five species were identified using the mating type Mat1-20 (ApMat) marker: C. alienum, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. In terms of virulence, C. alienum and C. fructicola were found to be the least virulent, while C. siamense and C. asianum exhibited the highest virulence. All identified species, except C. alienum, have been reported as causal pathogens of mango anthracnose. Notably, Colletotrichum alienum was the first species reported to be associated with mango anthracnose worldwide at the time of its discovery. Later, Ahmad et al. (2021) reported that C. alienum was associated with anthracnose in mango fruits of the Jin-Hwang cultivar in Beijing, China. To date, 17 species of Colletotrichum are known to be associated with mango anthracnose worldwide. With the application of multiple markers in phylogenetic analysis, it is likely that more new species will be identified from other mango-producing countries.
It is widely accepted that papaya (Carica papaya L.) originated in Central America and southern Mexico. Currently, this fruit crop is commercially cultivated in many tropical countries, with India as the leading producer, followed by Brazil, Mexico, Indonesia, and the Dominican Republic. Other papaya-producing countries include Thailand, the Philippines, China, Peru, and Nigeria.
Papaya is a climacteric fleshy fruit typically harvested at the pre-climacteric stage, meaning that ripening begins after harvest, resulting in a relatively short shelf life. During this period, several fruit rot pathogens, including Colletotrichum spp., can cause damage. Although papaya anthracnose symptoms can occur in both fruits and leaves, Colletotrichum infections are usually more severe in fruits. Refrigerated papayas are particularly susceptible to disease; therefore, fruits intended for export may develop anthracnose symptoms as they ripen.
Earlier studies, especially those conducted before the application of multiple markers became standard for identification, indicated that C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici were common anthracnose pathogens in papaya across various regions, including the Yucatan Peninsula in Mexico, Malaysia, the Miyako Islands in Okinawa, Japan, South Florida, and Trinidad. Additionally, C. dematium has been identified as a causative agent of papaya anthracnose in Yucatan, Mexico.
To date, several species within the C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, C. magnum, and C. orchidearum complexes have been associated with papaya anthracnose, indicating that more than two Colletotrichum species are involved. It is important to note that C. capsici is now considered a synonym of C. truncatum and is no longer used in many publications. In Australia, C. acutatum, C. simmondsii, and C. queenslandicum have been described in relation to papaya, while C. siamense has been identified in South Africa and China. In India, multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has revealed several species associated with papaya anthracnose, including C. karstii, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, and C. salsolae. Most of the reported species are not host-specific and can be found in various locations within papaya-producing countries.
Colletotrichum brevisporum and C. plurivorum have been reported as pathogens of papaya anthracnose in Taiwan. These pathogens were recovered from anthracnose lesions found on papaya fruits. In addition to Taiwan and Brazil, C. brevisporum has also been identified as a causal pathogen of papaya anthracnose in China. Another species, C. okinawense, first reported in Brazil, has been associated with papaya anthracnose in Taiwan. Colletotrichum magnum was identified as a causative agent of papaya anthracnose in Mexico and Costa Rica. Using the ITS region and specific primers, Molina-Chaves et al. (2017) depicted C. truncatum, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. magnum as pathogens of papaya anthracnose in Guácimo, Costa Rica. Colletotrichum truncatum has also been reported as a cause of papaya anthracnose in Korea.
Comprehensive studies focusing on the causative pathogens of papaya anthracnose are still lacking, with most available studies being either initial disease reports or disease notes. A study on genetic variation in C. magnum conducted by Pérez-Brito et al. (2018) aimed to understand pathogenicity patterns and responses to different fungicides. One reason for the lack of comprehensive studies on papaya anthracnose could be the prevalence of viral and bacterial diseases affecting papaya under field conditions, often leading to plant decay and decreased yields. Among viral diseases, papaya ringspot, caused by the Papaya ringspot virus (PRSV), is the most serious and has been detected in many papaya-producing countries in tropical and subtropical areas. In terms of bacterial diseases, papaya dieback is particularly destructive, with reported yield losses of up to 100% in Malaysia due to this pathogen.
In studies on control methods for papaya anthracnose, C. gloeosporioides is frequently cited as the causal pathogen. However, this should be approached with caution, as several other Colletotrichum species within the C. gloeosporioides complex are also associated with papaya anthracnose.
Dragon fruit (Hylocereus sp.) is believed to have originated in Central and South America and is now widely cultivated in many countries, including Vietnam, China, Mexico, Colombia, Nicaragua, Ecuador, Thailand, Malaysia, Indonesia, Australia, and the United States. China has recently begun large-scale planting of dragon fruit, with 20,000 hectares distributed across Guangdong and Guangxi provinces. Currently, the main producer of dragon fruit is Vietnam, followed by Thailand, Taiwan, the Philippines, Malaysia, Sri Lanka, Australia, and Israel. In South America, dragon fruit is cultivated in Mexico, Ecuador, Colombia, Nicaragua, and Guatemala.
Two common species of cultivated dragon fruits are Hylocereus polyrhizus (red-fleshed) and Hylocereus undatus (white-fleshed). The name "dragon fruit" likely derives from the fruit’s appearance, characterized by the presence of bracts or scales on its exterior. This fruit is also known by various local names, including strawberry pear or night-blooming cereus (in English-speaking regions), pitahaya (in Latin America), buah naga or buah mata naga (in Malaysia), thanh long (in Vietnam), kaeo mangkon or luk mangkon (in Thailand), päniniokapunahou or päpipi pua (in Hawaii), and paw wong fa kor (in China).
Dragon fruit anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum, affects the stems and fruits of Hylocereus spp. Earlier studies report C. gloeosporioides sensu lato as the most common anthracnose pathogen in Hylocereus megalanthus in Brazil; H. undatus is noted as prevalent in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, and in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been identified as an anthracnose-causing pathogen affecting the stems and fruits of H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and Selenicereus megalanthus in Malaysia. Using only ITS sequences, Lin et al. (2017) identified three species—C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and C. boninense—as anthracnose agents in H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and H. costaricensis plants growing in several counties. After applying multiple markers for the identification of Colletotrichum species, several members within the C. gloeosporioides complex have been reported as anthracnose pathogens in Hylocereus spp. Ma et al. (2014) reported C. gloeosporioides as an anthracnose pathogen in the young stems of H. undatus in China. In a later study, Zhao et al. (2018) found C. siamense to be the causative agent of stem anthracnose in H. polyrhizus in China. Additionally, C. aenigma and C. siamense have been reported to be associated with stem and fruit anthracnose in H. undatus grown in Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Sakhon, Thailand. Colletotrichum siamense is also responsible for fruit anthracnose in H. undatus growing in the Andaman Islands, India. In Brazil, C. karstii was reported as the causal pathogen of stem anthracnose in H. undatus. In addition to species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, C. truncatum is also reported as an anthracnose pathogen in Hylocereus spp. Colletotrichum truncatum is the causative agent of stem anthracnose in H. polyrhizus in Malaysia, and H. undatus was also reported in fruits sold in a market in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, China. Seven Colletotrichum species were identified as causal anthracnose pathogens of different types of dragon fruits. However, information on anthracnose pathogens associated with fruits and stems in major producing countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, is still lacking.
Guava (Psidium guajava L.) is cultivated for its edible fruits, which are rich in vitamin C and dietary fiber. Guava fruits can be consumed fresh or processed into products such as purées, jams, marmalades, jellies, fruit pastes, juice, syrup, candy, and chutneys. Additionally, guava leaves are utilized in folk medicine due to their beneficial properties in treating various ailments, including diarrhea, dysentery, gastroenteritis, hypertension, and diabetes, as well as improving locomotor coordination. This tropical fruit crop is native to Mexico, Central America, and South America and has different local names depending on the region. For example, it is known as jambu batu in Malay, amrood in Hindi, perakka in Malayalam, and farang in Thai. In French-speaking regions, guava is referred to as goyave or goyavier; Hawaiians call it kuawa, while in Portuguese-speaking areas, it is known as goiaba or goiabeira. India is the leading producer of guava, with an estimated annual production of 17,650,000 metric tons, followed by Thailand and China. Other guava-producing countries include Pakistan, Mexico, Indonesia, Brazil, the Philippines, and Nigeria.
Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has been reported as a common anthracnose pathogen in several guava-growing countries [74, 75, 77, 83]. In Hawaii, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been noted to infect guava leaves [76]. Intan Sakinah et al. (2014) [78] identified C. gloeosporioides sensu lato as the most prevalent species causing anthracnose in guava fruit, while suggesting that other species within the C. gloeosporioides complex may also be implicated in guava anthracnose. Additionally, Colletotrichum acutatum has been reported to cause anthracnose disease in guava [134–136]. More recent multiple gene phylogeny studies aimed at identifying Colletotrichum species indicate that several species from the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes are associated with guava anthracnose. The C. acutatum complex includes C. simmondsii in Brazil [79], C. abscissum in Brazil and the USA [80, 82], and C. guajavae in India [12]. Among the species in the C. gloeosporioides complex associated with guava, C. psidii was detected in Italy [13], and C. siamense was found in India [81]. In a pathogenicity study by Bragança et al. (2016) [82], C. nymphaeae, isolated from apple fruits in Brazil, was shown to cause lesions on guava fruits, highlighting the cross-pathogenicity of this species.
In summary, several Colletotrichum species are associated with guava anthracnose. This information may be useful for developing integrated disease management strategies to control guava anthracnose, particularly as some of the involved species have a wide host range.
Avocado (Persea americana Mill.) is a common tropical fruit originating from Central America, specifically Mexico and Guatemala. Mexico is the leading producer and exporter of avocado, followed by the Netherlands, Peru, Spain, Chile, and Colombia [137]. Other avocado-producing countries include India, Indonesia, Israel, China, Kenya, Vietnam, the Philippines, Australia, and New Zealand.
Avocado is a rich source of nutrients, particularly fatty acids like oleic and palmitic acids, along with various minerals and vitamins. It also contains phytochemicals such as tannins, alkaloids, phenols, saponins, flavonoids, and lutein, the predominant carotenoid in avocado fruits [138]. These compounds contribute to numerous medicinal properties of avocado, including antimicrobial, anti-inflammatory, analgesic, antihypoglycemic, antihypertensive, antihepatotoxic, anticonvulsant, and vasorelaxant effects [138].
Anthracnose can occur in avocados wherever they are grown, particularly during the wet season and in areas with high rainfall. Major infections typically affect the fruit, although leaves and stems can also be impacted. The dark lesions caused by anthracnose pathogens can rapidly expand on the fruit's surface and infect the pulp, leading to rot [84].
Before the advent of multiple gene phylogeny for identifying Colletotrichum species, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato was the most frequently found species associated with avocado anthracnose, followed by C. acutatum sensu lato [84]. However, molecular analyses have identified C. gloeosporioides as the causative agent of avocado fruit anthracnose in locations such as Mexico [85], Mersin Province in Turkey [88], and Ghana [90]. Hunupolagama et al. (2015) [86] identified C. gigasporum as a causative agent of avocado anthracnose in Sri Lanka, based on four genetic markers: ITS, actin (ACT), GAPDH, and β-tubulin. In Mexico, two species, C. godetiae [87] and C. karstii [139], were identified as anthracnose pathogens on avocado, both confirmed through ITS and GAPDH sequencing.
Countries have reported a new species, Colletotrichum perseae, in association with avocado anthracnose for the first time. While C. aenigma is the most virulent species identified in Israel, C. perseae is considered the most dominant species overall. Other studies conducted in various avocado-producing countries have identified either the same species or different Colletotrichum species responsible for avocado anthracnose, as noted by Sharma et al. (2017) [91]. Fuentes-Aragón et al. (2018) [92] reported C. fructicola as the causal pathogen of avocado anthracnose in Hidalgo, Mexico. Giblin et al. (2018) [93] isolated and identified five species previously categorized as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato from avocado fruit in eastern Australia: C. alienum, C. asianum, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. siamense. Shivas et al. (2016) [89] also confirmed the presence of C. alienum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense in Australian avocados. Kwon et al. (2020) [94] identified C. kahawae subsp. cigarro as an isolate obtained from an imported avocado variety in a market in Jinju, South Korea. Uysal and Kurt (2020) [25] reported C. karstii as the causal pathogen of avocado fruit and leaf anthracnose in Turkey. In southeastern Brazil, both C. siamense and C. karstii were associated with avocado anthracnose [97].
Another comprehensive study on the pathogens of avocado anthracnose was conducted by Fuentes-Aragón et al. (2020) [96]. This study, which utilized six markers (GAPDH, ITS, ACT, CHS-1, ApMat, and β-tubulin), indicated that 11 species were causal pathogens of avocado anthracnose in Mexico, namely C. karstii, C. godetiae, C. siamense, C. fioriniae, C. cigarro, C. chrysophilum, C. jiangxiense, C. tropicale, C. nymphaeae, along with two new lineages designated as Colletotrichum sp. 1 and Colletotrichum sp. 2. The most prevalent species identified was C. siamense, while the most widespread was C. karstii.
Reports suggest that Colletotrichum species associated with avocado anthracnose are similar to those found in other tropical fruit crops. This includes species such as C. asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense, which are known to infect a wide range of hosts. However, there is a lack of reports on Colletotrichum species associated with avocado anthracnose from other major avocado-producing countries, including Indonesia, the Dominican Republic, Peru, and Venezuela. Many studies from these countries refer to C. gloeosporioides sensu lato as the causal pathogen of avocado anthracnose, which may not be entirely accurate.
Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].
Chitosan has emerged as a key component in edible coating formulations due to its antifungal properties, often being combined with other compounds such as essential oils. The antifungal efficacy of both conventional chitosan and chitosan in submicron dispersion was tested against C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, a pathogen responsible for anthracnose in dragon fruit, as demonstrated by Asgar et al. (2013). When applied to the fruit, chitosan treatments significantly reduced the symptoms of anthracnose and the overall disease development.
Furthermore, combining chitosan with essential oil from Cymbopogon citratus showed inhibitory effects against five anthracnose pathogens (C. asianum, C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. tropicale, and C. karstii) when inoculated on guava, mango, and papaya. Braga et al. (2019) reported that a combination of chitosan and peppermint essential oils (Mentha piperita L. and Mentha x villosa Huds) inhibited the growth of anthracnose pathogens (C. gloeosporioides and C. brevisporum) on papaya in vitro, leading to reduced anthracnose lesions after 10 days of storage.
Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) inorganic and organic salts have also been evaluated as edible coatings for controlling anthracnose pathogens and minimizing fruit rot. Carbonates, sorbates, benzoates, and silicates are noted for their low toxicity and antifungal properties, with promising results in inhibiting anthracnose pathogens. De Costa and Gunawardhana (2012) found that sodium bicarbonate reduced appressorium formation, spore production, germination, and mycelial growth of the banana anthracnose pathogen, C. musae, in vitro. Additionally, anthracnose lesions were mitigated by dipping the fruit into a 300 mM salt solution for 10 minutes. Jitareerat et al. (2018) demonstrated that sodium carbonate and potassium sorbate inhibited spore germination of C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici. They also found that immersing the fruit in a potassium sorbate and hot water solution (55°C for 5 minutes) followed by cooling in water effectively reduced disease severity without compromising fruit quality. Kalupahana et al. (2020) tested sodium bicarbonate and sodium metabisulfite against the mango anthracnose pathogen, C. siamense, finding both salts to inhibit mycelial growth.
Nanomaterials, including copper, silver, nickel, and magnesium, possess antifungal properties and may be effective for managing anthracnose pathogens and post-harvest diseases. The efficacy of zinc oxide, magnesium oxide, and their composites (52–219 nm) was tested against C. gloeosporioides in papaya and avocado, showing inhibited conidial germination and damage to fungal cells. Jagana et al. (2017) further supported these findings, reporting that copper, silver, nickel, and magnesium (68 nm) extracted from the leaves of medicinal plants like ajwain (Trachyspermum ammi) and neem (Azadirachta indica) inhibited the spore germination of C. musae isolated from bananas. They also observed that the severity of banana anthracnose was reduced with a 0.2% silver-neem treatment.
Composite nanomaterials combined with other materials can also effectively control mango anthracnose. Antifungal properties were reported when a chitosan-silver composite (495–616 nm in diameter) was used, which suppressed conidial germination of C. gloeosporioides. An in vivo study indicated that 0.5% and 1% nanomaterial composites reduced anthracnose disease by 45.7% and 71.3%, respectively. Neem extract was utilized to synthesize copper oxychloride-conjugated silver (21–25 nm), which effectively suppressed the growth of C. gloeosporioides.
Alternative methods to reduce post-harvest fruit crop losses are being actively researched. Biocontrol agents, edible fruit coatings, Generally Recognized as Safe (GRAS) salts, cold plasma, and nanomaterial treatments have shown promising results, although they come with challenges. The effectiveness of these methods varies among different fruit crops, and further investigation is needed regarding their formulations and costs. Additionally, some methods are combined to enhance efficacy, leading to other issues such as public and industry acceptance, product registration, and commercial viability.
Previously, anthracnose pathogens were often identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or C. acutatum, primarily due to the identification procedures that typically did not utilize multiple markers, often analyzing only the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. Consequently, the data obtained may not accurately reflect the true causal pathogens. It is now acknowledged that C. gloeosporioides is not the most common anthracnose pathogen affecting tropical fruit crops, as previously believed. Various Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose in tropical fruit crops, presenting significant limitations in the production and marketing of these commodities.
A detailed examination of diverse Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose in banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado reveals that some of these species infect not only the fruits but also the stems and leaves. This indicates that other parts of the plants may harbor sources of inoculum for anthracnose infections in fruit crops. Several species, including C. siamense, C. asianum, C. scovillei, C. gloeosporioides, C. karstii, C. fructicola, and C. tropicale, can infect multiple hosts, demonstrating the potential for cross-infection among various types of fruit crops and other plants.
Molecular phylogenetic analysis has revealed a diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose in tropical fruits. Many of the species listed belong to different complexes, such as C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. boninense. Species within these complexes are closely related and exhibit similar infection and colonization behaviors. Therefore, the infection and colonization patterns of various Colletotrichum species on different tropical fruit crops tend to be alike.
In terms of virulence, anthracnose symptoms can vary among different fruits based on factors such as the variety of the fruit, inoculum concentration, humidity, and temperature. Furthermore, pathogenic variation among Colletotrichum species infecting fruit crops has been documented. The diverse species of Colletotrichum that cause anthracnose in fruit crops also pose quarantine concerns. Fruits such as banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado are exported and imported worldwide, and latent infections are a key part of the disease cycle for anthracnose pathogens. This raises the possibility of these pathogens being distributed to new areas or regions.
Accurate identification and scientific naming of anthracnose pathogens are crucial because precise taxonomic information allows us to classify a given species as a pathogen, saprophyte, or endophyte. The species involved in anthracnose affecting tropical fruits may exhibit different characteristics, emphasizing the importance of proper identification of the causative pathogen for effective disease management.
This table summarizes various species of Colletotrichum and the parts of plants they infect. It includes multiple species, such as C. scovillei, C. gloeosporioides, and C. siamense, with specific mentions of the infected parts for each plant type.
Banana (Musa spp.): Infected by C. scovillei, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and others. While C. theobromicola primarily affects ripe fruit, it has also been reported on leaves and roots.
Mango (Mangifera indica L.): Infections by C. asianum, C. karstii, C. scovillei, and others are noted, affecting both fruit and leaves.
Guava (Psidium guajava L.): C. gloeosporioides and its variants infect fruit and leaves, with additional species like C. simmondsii also present.
Avocado (Persea americana Mill.): Infected primarily by C. gloeosporioides, with other species affecting fruit and occasionally other parts of the plant.
Young stems are affected by various C. gloeosporioides variants and other related species.
