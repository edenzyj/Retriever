Answer 28 :
This passage discusses the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae, which was first identified in Florida in 1931. It is a specific type of fungus that infects only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern United States. The fungus causes crown rot and death in strawberry plants, and is considered a significant threat to strawberry nurseries.

Answer 29 :
This is a scientific paper titled "Strawberry Anthracnose: Histopathology of Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae" published in the journal Phytopathology in 2002. The authors, Kenneth J. Curry, Maritza Abril, Jana B. Avant, and Barbara J. Smith, describe the histopathology of the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) plants.

The paper aims to document the invasion strategies of C. acutatum and C. fragariae in strawberry plants, and to examine the distribution of chitin in the walls of C. fragariae during the initial infection of the strawberry host. The authors used light and electron microscopy to study the ontogeny of the invasion process by the two fungal species on petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler.

The results show that the invasion of host tissue by both C. acutatum and C. fragariae is similar, but each invasion event occurs more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum. The authors describe the steps of invasion, including cuticular penetration via an appressorium, hyphal growth within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells, and the formation of acervuli, which release conidia.

The authors also used gold-labeled wheat germ agglutinin to study the distribution of chitin in the walls of C. fragariae during the initial infection of the strawberry host. They found that the outer layer of bilayered walls of conidia, germ tubes, and appressoria contained less chitin than unilayered hyphae in planta.

The paper provides valuable insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose and the mechanisms of infection by C. acutatum and C. fragariae. It also highlights the importance of understanding the interactions between fungal pathogens and their hosts in order to develop effective management strategies for strawberry anthracnose.

Answer 31 :
This text appears to be a scientific paper discussing the relationship between nutrient concentrations and the development of anthracnose in strawberry plants. Here's a summary of the main points:

* Previous studies have shown correlations between nitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose in crops such as cotton and strawberry.
* Manganese and calcium have been shown to have a direct role in phenolic metabolism and may increase synthesis of host defense products, reducing disease incidence and severity.
* Calcium has been found to inhibit anthracnose in apples and decrease postharvest disease development on strawberry.
* A study found that calcium may be important for resistance against certain cell-wall-degrading enzymes produced by fungal pathogens.
* However, in this study, no effect was found of calcium content on anthracnose disease in strawberry.
* Manganese content is increased under low nitrogen conditions in plants, and additional work is needed to determine whether manganese levels are related to anthracnose development.
* Phosphorus supplied as phosphite has been found to reduce phytophthora root and crown rot in tomato and pepper plants, but also suppressed plant growth.

The paper then presents the results of an analysis of the relationship between nutrient concentrations and strawberry plant dry weight, as well as the development of anthracnose in strawberry plants treated with different concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. The results show that:

* Nitrogen concentration is positively correlated with strawberry plant dry weight, with an R2 value of 0.9078.
* Phosphorus concentration is also positively correlated with strawberry plant dry weight, with an R2 value of 0.8842.
* Potassium concentration is positively correlated with strawberry plant dry weight, with an R2 value of 0.8587.
* Calcium concentration is not significantly correlated with strawberry plant dry weight, with an R2 value of 0.6526.

The paper also presents a scatter plot showing the development of anthracnose and nutrient concentration in strawberry plants treated with different concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium. The results show that the development of anthracnose is not significantly related to calcium concentration, but is significantly related to nitrogen and potassium concentrations.
