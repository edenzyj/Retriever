Notes: Anthracnose is an important disease of cassava (e.g. 
Chevaugeon 1956, Makambila 1994, Fokunang et al. 2000, 
Owolade et al. 2008), variously referred to Colletotrichum manihotis, 
Gloeosporium manihotis Henn., Glomerella manihotis (Sacc.)

tions and cultural practices to reduce losses
due to anthracnose. Failure of fungicides
to control anthracnose epidemics may be
due to the development of fungicide resis-
tance in the Colletotrichum spp. population.
For example, benomyl was shown to effec-
tively reduce the incidence of anthracnose
crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971)
and was used intensively by strawberry
growers for years to control anthracnose
and other diseases. However, the anthracnose
pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae,
developed resistance to it and other bend-
imidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995;
McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black,
1992, 1993), and benomyl was no longer
effective for anthracnose control in straw-
berry fields. In-vitro trials have been used to
screen fungicides for their ability to control
anthracnose (LaMondia, 1993; McInnes
et al., 1992b; Smith and Black, 1992). Smith
and Black (1993) reported that all 16 C.
acutatum, 14 out of 18 C. fragariae, and both
C. gloeosporioides isolates they tested in
vitro were resistant to benomyl and that all
benomyl-resistant isolates were also resistant
to carbendazim, which is in the same class of
fungicides as benomyl. In a greenhouse
study, plants treated with propiconazole had
lower disease severity ratings than did plants
treated with captafol or benomyl (Smith and
Black, 1991). However, the propiconazole-
treated plants were shorter with dark green
leaves that appeared thicker than the leaves of
untreated plants.

Anthracnose spreads within a field by
splashing water, and living mulches (such
as wheat, rye, or rye grass) in row middles
have been shown to reduce disease spread
within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-
specific herbicides such as sethoxydim, may
be used to prevent excessive growth of rye
grass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such
as wheat straw or pine needles, will also
reduce splash and result in lower incidence
of anthracnose compared with rows mulched
with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and
Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose is less severe
when water is supplied to plants using drip
irrigation rather than overhead irrigation
(Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986).

The primary means to reduce the buildup
of anthracnose fruit rot in the field is to
harvest fruit frequently and remove all rotten
fruit from the field. Following severe infec-
tions early in the fruiting season, all infected
fruit should be stripped from the plants and
removed from the field. Infected areas of a
field should be harvested last in the day, or
workers should wash up and change to clean
clothes when they must enter un-infected
areas of the field after they have harvested
areas where fruit rot is present.
