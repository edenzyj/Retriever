Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

Notes: This species is placed in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See additional notes and specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, which is also described from Hymenocallis, primarily based on multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony color. Although the gene selection was suitable for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates appeared genetically distinct from C. siamense. However, in our analysis, where the C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts worldwide, the authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically.

The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.

The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).

The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).

Anthracnose is a significant disease affecting grape crops (Dowling et al., 2020). Beyond causing severe yield losses, anthracnose epidemics can diminish the quality of the produce (Waller et al., 2002; Dowling et al., 2020). The most economically damaging symptoms often include blossom blight and fruit rots; however, necrotic lesions may also develop on leaves, stems, and twigs, leading to plant deterioration and reduced fruit quality (Dowling et al., 2020).

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.

To provide accurate information for disease control and resistance breeding, this study aimed to reveal the population composition of the infectious agents associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. Samples collected from major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan from 2010 to 2018 were subjected to morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at various temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium, as well as their ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the UK and China (including Anhui, Hainan, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces, as well as Beijing and Shanghai), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose disease in subtropical regions.

Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.

Pathogenicity Assay: The susceptible cultivar "Taoyuan No. 1" was used for all inoculation tests in this study. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. (one isolate from each species) was examined following Koch's postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff (10^6 spores/ml) and by applying 1 ml of spore suspension (10^6 spores/ml) to the crown region after removing one to two old leaves. Following inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags to maintain >90% relative humidity for 3 days at 30°C, then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30°C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased tissues using the single hypha tip isolation method and then identified based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequences as described above.

The ontogeny of the invasion process by Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae was studied on petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler using light and electron microscopy. The invasion of host tissue by each fungal species was similar; however, each invasion event occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum. Following cuticular penetration via an appressorium, subsequent steps of invasion involved hyphal growth within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. Both species of fungi are responsible for causing anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.), which are attributed to the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk) (8, 21–23, 26). All three species incite diseases that cannot be distinguished in the field by symptoms alone. Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown worldwide but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they cause little injury to the plants. C. fragariae is most often associated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, humid regions such as the southeastern United States. Its host range is limited to strawberries and a few weeds (22). Conversely, C. acutatum is the primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot, has a broader geographic and host range than C. fragariae (8, 10, 22), and is increasing in importance as a cause of petiole, stolon, crown, and root infections (7).

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

In the literature, C. siamense has been most frequently reported in tropical and subtropical regions, while C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. karstii have been documented across a wide range of latitudes. Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting a pathogen's survival. A recent study based on published observations of 612 crop pests and pathogens from 1960 onward revealed significant positive latitudinal shifts of many important pests and pathogens under climate change. More research on the genetic and biological characteristics of different Colletotrichum species from diverse geographical areas is necessary to understand the emergence and spread of anthracnose diseases. With rising global temperatures, it will be particularly important to monitor the expansion of the heat-adapted C. siamense toward higher latitudes.

The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.

Pathogenicity Assay: The susceptible cultivar "Taoyuan No. 1" was used for all inoculation tests in this study. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. (one isolate from each species) was examined following Koch's postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff (10^6 spores/ml) and by applying 1 ml of spore suspension (10^6 spores/ml) to the crown region after removing one to two old leaves. Following inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags to maintain >90% relative humidity for 3 days at 30°C, then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30°C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased tissues using the single hypha tip isolation method and then identified based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequences as described above.

Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.

Colletotrichum species are categorized into phylogenetic clades (also referred to as species complexes) based on multilocus molecular analysis. Species within a clade are closely related and share similar temperature requirements (Cannon et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2020; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021; Salotti et al., 2022). A recent systematic review identified 15 major clades of the genus, along with several smaller clusters and isolated species (Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). Detailed descriptions of these major phylogenetic clades and the species within them have been provided by multiple studies (Cannon et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2020; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021; Damm et al., 2009, 2012, 2013, 2014; Weir et al., 2012).

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

Colletotrichum spp. have traditionally been classified based on the shape of the conidia and appressorium, the presence of a seta or perithecium, and culture characteristics. Using these criteria, early studies reported C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae as strawberry anthracnose pathogens. However, Colletotrichum spp. share similar features, and morphological characteristics can be influenced by environmental factors including culture media, light, and temperature. Therefore, a polyphasic approach based on morphology and genetic characteristics has been proposed for the identification of Colletotrichum species. A combination of multiple gene sequences, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), can provide more molecular features to resolve different species within the Colletotrichum species complex.

Mathematical models can help growers schedule fungicide sprays (Pertot et al., 2017; Rossi et al., 2019; Fedele et al., 2022). Models have been developed to understand the epidemiology of anthracnose on specific crops and to support infection-risk-based fungicide applications (Dodd et al., 1991; Park et al., 1992; Monroe et al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh, 2020). However, most of these models are simple, considering only one component of the pathogen life cycle—primarily conidial infection—and focus on a single Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of these models have never been validated against independent data (i.e., data not used in model development). In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts. As a result, mechanistic models are considered useful for decision-making in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (De Wolf and Isard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al. (2021) developed and validated a mechanistic, weather-driven model for the ripe rot of grapes caused by Colletotrichum species.

Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.

The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan.

No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

Because the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appeared to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised, after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s, to obtain their transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, which were believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. More recently, C. acutatum has been found in some nurseries in these areas. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants can be produced in the southeastern United States by locating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants remain the primary control method for anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.

C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.

The name C. fragariae was originally applied to isolates associated with a disease affecting strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa) runners (stolons) and petioles in Florida (Brooks 1931). Although it was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957), it has continued to be referenced in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. Sutton (1992) accepted it as distinct, although he noted the confusion surrounding the application of the name. The designation of one of Brooks’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has provided a modern genetic basis for this name. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae is positioned in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a diverse range of hosts worldwide, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, which is regarded as an earlier name for C. fragariae as accepted in this paper.

C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.

Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.

Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.

The ontogeny of the invasion process by Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae was studied on petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler using light and electron microscopy. The invasion of host tissue by each fungal species was similar; however, each invasion event occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum. Following cuticular penetration via an appressorium, subsequent steps of invasion involved hyphal growth within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. Both species of fungi are responsible for causing anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.), which are attributed to the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk) (8, 21–23, 26). All three species incite diseases that cannot be distinguished in the field by symptoms alone. Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown worldwide but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they cause little injury to the plants. C. fragariae is most often associated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, humid regions such as the southeastern United States. Its host range is limited to strawberries and a few weeds (22). Conversely, C. acutatum is the primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot, has a broader geographic and host range than C. fragariae (8, 10, 22), and is increasing in importance as a cause of petiole, stolon, crown, and root infections (7).

Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.

The analysis highlights the complex relationships among the species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex based on multigene concatenated Bayesian inference phylogenies. A total of 22 species and one subspecies are recognized within this complex. Notably, isolates of G. cingulata "f. sp. camelliae" appear as a distinct genetic group, although this group remains unnamed due to uncertainties about its relationship with C. camelliae. Additionally, some isolates, such as ICMP 18614 and ICMP 18616 from grape in Japan, as well as ICMP 18726 from pawpaw in the Cook Islands, hint at potentially unnamed species due to limited data.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.
