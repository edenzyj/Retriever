Answer 1 :
This is a scientific text discussing the threat of anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. The text highlights the following points:

1. Anthracnose is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm and humid climates.
2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. are the primary inoculum causing epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease.
3. The conidia germinate, form appressoria, and penetrate epidermal cells, causing infection in various strawberry tissues.
4. The disease can cause black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, and wilting of the whole plant due to crown rot.
5. High humidity can lead to the formation of concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses on necrotic tissues.
6. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes up to 80% mortality of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the field.
7. In Taiwan, the high temperature, high humidity, and heavy rainfall during the propagation period (March to September) create a suitable environment for epidemics.
8. From 2010 to 2016, anthracnose crown rot caused the loss of 30-40% of seedlings and ~20% of plants after transplanting.

Overall, the text emphasizes the importance of controlling anthracnose disease to ensure the sustainability of strawberry production in warm and humid climates.

Answer 23 :
This text describes the infection process and pathogenesis of two fungal species, Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum fragariae, on strawberry plants.

Here are the key points:

1. Both fungal species invade the host tissue in a similar manner, but C. fragariae infects the plants more rapidly than C. acutatum.
2. The fungi penetrate the cuticle of the plant through an appressorium and then grow within the cuticle and cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells.
3. The invasion process involves a brief biotrophic phase, where the fungi invade living cells, followed by an extended necrotrophic phase, where they proliferate among dead cells.
4. Acervuli (small, flask-shaped structures) form once the cortical tissue has been moderately disrupted and develop as a stroma just beneath the outer periclinal epidermal walls.
5. Acervuli erupt through the cuticle and release conidia (spores) into the environment.
6. Invasion of the vascular tissue typically occurs after acervuli mature, but remains minimal.

Overall, the text provides a detailed description of the infection process and pathogenesis of Colletotrichum species on strawberry plants, highlighting their similarities and differences in terms of their rate of infection and tissue invasion.

Answer 25 :
A technical passage about controlling anthracnose in strawberry fields!

Here's a breakdown of the main points:

* The primary source of infection in most fruiting fields is infected transplants.
* To prevent the spread of anthracnose crown rot, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California.
* These areas were believed to be outside the range of Colletotrichum fragariae, the fungus responsible for anthracnose.
* However, more recently, C. acutatum has been found in some nurseries in these areas, which means that this measure is no longer a foolproof solution.

In summary, the passage is discussing the importance of obtaining healthy transplants from reliable sources to prevent the spread of anthracnose in strawberry fields.

Answer 26 :
This text discusses ways to prevent the spread of anthracnose, a fungal disease that affects crops. Here are the main points:

1. **Splash water**: Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, so reducing splash water can help prevent the disease from spreading.
2. **Living mulches**: Using living mulches, such as wheat, rye, or rye grass, in row middles can reduce disease spread within a field.
3. **Sublethal herbicides**: Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, can be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass.
4. **Organic mulches**: Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, can reduce splash water and result in lower incidence of anthracnose.
5. **Plastic mulches**: In contrast, using plastic mulches can increase the incidence of anthracnose.
6. **Drip irrigation**: Anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation.

Overall, the text suggests that using a combination of these methods can help prevent the spread of anthracnose and reduce its impact on crops.

Answer 42 :
This passage discusses the effectiveness of various fungicides in controlling anthracnose, a disease affecting strawberry plants. Specifically:

1. Benomyl was initially effective in reducing anthracnose incidence and was widely used by strawberry growers. However, the pathogens (C. acutatum and C. fragariae) developed resistance to benomyl and other bendimazole fungicides.
2. In-vitro trials were conducted to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose.
3. Smith and Black (1993) found that all 16 C. acutatum, 14 out of 18 C. fragariae, and both C. gloeosporioides isolates tested in vitro were resistant to benomyl. Additionally, all benomyl-resistant isolates were also resistant to carbendazim, which is in the same class of fungicides as benomyl.
4. A greenhouse study found that plants treated with propiconazole had lower disease severity ratings than those treated with captafol or benomyl. However, the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter with thicker, darker green leaves compared to untreated plants.

Overall, the passage highlights the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of fungicides and the development of resistance in pathogens, as well as the potential for fungicides to have unintended effects on plant growth and development.

Answer 43 :
This text is discussing the simplification of a model related to the life cycle of Colletotrichum, a type of fungus. Specifically, it is focusing on the role of sexual spores in the life cycle.

Here are the main points:

1. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by certain species of Colletotrichum.
2. However, perithecia rarely occur in the field, and the asexual stage is considered the main source of inoculum for disease development.
3. Therefore, the model is focusing on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, and asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli are considered the primary inoculum responsible for anthracnose epidemics.

In summary, the model is simplifying the life cycle of Colletotrichum by focusing on the asexual stage and ignoring the sexual stage, as the asexual stage is considered the primary source of inoculum for disease development.

Answer 44 :
This is a scientific article discussing the effects of nitrogen and potassium concentrations on anthracnose disease in strawberry plants. Here's a summary of the article:

**Introduction**: The article reports on an experiment investigating the relationship between nitrogen and potassium concentrations in the nutrient solution and the development of anthracnose disease in strawberry plants.

**Methods**: The experiment involved treating strawberry plants with different concentrations of nitrogen (N), potassium (K), and other nutrients. The plants were inoculated with a fungus to induce anthracnose disease.

**Results**:

1. **Nitrogen concentration**: A positive correlation was found between nitrogen concentration and anthracnose disease. The disease was most severe at a nitrogen concentration of 30 mM (DI ∼ 3).
2. **Potassium concentration**: A similar positive relationship was found between potassium concentration and anthracnose disease. The disease was also most severe at a potassium concentration of 30 mM (DI ∼ 3).
3. **Nitrogen source**: The study found that anthracnose disease tended to be more severe in treatments receiving NH4 than NO3, but the difference was not significant.
4. **Table 1**: The article provides a table listing the composition of the nutrient solutions applied to the strawberry plants, including different concentrations of N, P, K, Ca, Mg, and SO4.

**Conclusion**: The study suggests that high concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in the nutrient solution can contribute to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberry plants.

Answer 45 :
This text provides guidance on how to manage anthracnose fruit rot in a field. The primary method of reducing the buildup of the disease is to harvest fruit frequently and remove all rotten fruit from the field. This helps to prevent the spread of the disease and reduces the risk of further infection.

The text also recommends the following additional measures:

1. Stripping infected fruit from plants: If severe infections occur early in the fruiting season, it is recommended to strip all infected fruit from the plants and remove it from the field.
2. Harvesting infected areas last: When harvesting a field, it is recommended to harvest the areas where fruit rot is present last in the day. This helps to prevent the spread of the disease to un-infected areas of the field.
3. Changing clothes: When entering un-infected areas of the field after harvesting areas where fruit rot is present, it is recommended to wash up and change into clean clothes. This helps to prevent the spread of the disease through contaminated clothing and tools.

Overall, the text provides practical advice on how to manage anthracnose fruit rot in a field and reduce the risk of further infection.
