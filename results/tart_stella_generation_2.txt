This text appears to be a scientific article discussing the use of fungicides to control diseases in strawberry crops. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

1. Benomyl was previously used to control anthracnose and other diseases in strawberry crops, but its effectiveness was reduced due to the development of resistance by the pathogens.
2. In-vitro trials were conducted to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose, and it was found that many isolates of the pathogens C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides were resistant to benomyl and other bendimidazole fungicides.
3. A greenhouse study found that plants treated with propiconazole had lower disease severity ratings than those treated with captafol or benomyl, but the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter and had thicker, darker leaves.
4. The study suggests that propiconazole may be a more effective fungicide for controlling anthracnose in strawberry crops, but it may have some drawbacks in terms of plant growth and appearance.

Overall, the text highlights the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of fungicides and developing new strategies to control diseases in strawberry crops.

Answer 1 :
This passage discusses the three species of Colletotrichum fungi that cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. The three species are:

1. Colletotrichum fragariae: This fungus was previously thought to be the primary cause of anthracnose in strawberries in the United States, but was later found to be less common than previously thought.
2. Colletotrichum acutatum: This fungus was first reported in the United States in 1986, and was previously known to cause anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia.
3. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides: This fungus causes anthracnose crown rot, petiole lesions, and leaf spots in strawberries, and is indistinguishable from the symptoms caused by C. fragariae.

The passage notes that C. acutatum had likely been present in the United States for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. before it was officially identified.

Answer 5 :
The conclusion of the article is that:

* As our understanding of anthracnose pathogens and epidemiology has increased, our ability to control the disease has also increased.
* Changes in cultural practices have reduced the levels of disease.
* The development of more effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have greatly reduced losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.
* Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also reduced economic losses due to these diseases.
* However, growers may still sustain severe losses when environmental factors are highly favorable for anthracnose development.

Answer 6 :
This text discusses the management of anthracnose disease in sorghum fields. Here are the main points:

1. **Crop debris removal**: Removing crop debris can reduce anthracnose severity by up to 30%.
2. **Resistant cultivars**: Using resistant cultivars is an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way to control the disease.
3. **Available cultivars**: However, available marketable cultivars often do not provide enough resistance to eliminate the need for fungicides.
4. **Biological control agents (BCAs)**: BCAs like Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilus have been considered, but their efficacy is variable under field conditions.
5. **Farmers' preference**: Many farmers still prefer combining cultural practices and chemical control methods due to the variable efficacy of BCAs.
6. **Calendar-based application of chemicals**: This remains the main tool for controlling anthracnose diseases, leading to intensive fungicide sprays.
7. **Economic and ecological sustainability**: Intensive fungicide sprays may not be economically or ecologically sustainable.

Overall, the text highlights the need for more sustainable and effective methods to manage anthracnose disease in sorghum fields, beyond just relying on calendar-based application of chemicals.

Answer 19 :
This is a scientific paper titled "Strawberry Anthracnose: Histopathology of Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae" published in the journal Phytopathology in 2002. The authors, Kenneth J. Curry, Maritza Abril, Jana B. Avant, and Barbara J. Smith, describe the histopathology of the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae, which cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.

The paper aims to document the invasion strategies of C. acutatum and C. fragariae in strawberry plants, with a focus on the ultrastructure of the fungal infection process. The authors used light and electron microscopy to study the invasion of petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler by the two fungal species.

The results show that the invasion of host tissue by both fungal species is similar, with the fungus penetrating the cuticle and growing within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. The authors also found that the fungus initially enters a biotrophic phase, where it maintains the host cells alive, before switching to a necrotrophic phase, where it kills the host cells.

The paper also examines the distribution of chitin in the walls of C. fragariae during the initial infection of the strawberry host. The authors used a lectin probe, gold-labeled wheat germ agglutinin, to study the distribution of chitin in the walls of C. fragariae.

The study provides valuable insights into the mechanisms of fungal infection and disease development in strawberry plants, and may be useful for the development of strategies to control anthracnose diseases in strawberries.

Some of the key findings and concepts discussed in the paper include:

* The fungus initially enters a biotrophic phase, where it maintains the host cells alive, before switching to a necrotrophic phase, where it kills the host cells.
* The fungus grows within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells, killing the host cells prior to entering their lumina.
* Chitin is present in the walls of C. fragariae during the initial infection of the strawberry host, but the level of chitin in the outer layer of bilayered walls of conidia, germ tubes, and appressoria is lower than in unilayered hyphae in planta.
* The fungus modifies or masks chitin in structures involved in early penetration to avoid detection by the host or to avoid the effects of host chitinases.
* The study provides insights into the mechanisms of fungal infection and disease development in strawberry plants, and may be useful for the development of strategies to control anthracnose diseases in strawberries.

Answer 25 :
This passage discusses the potential benefits of clade-based calibration in identifying and understanding anthracnose diseases caused by Colletotrichum species. The main points are:

1. Clade-based calibration may be useful in identifying the main causal agents of olive anthracnose, which are often attributed to several Colletotrichum species belonging to the same clade.
2. The main causal agents of olive anthracnose vary by region, with different species dominant in different areas (e.g., C. godetiae in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia; C. nymphaeae in Portugal; and C. fioriniae in California).
3. Proper identification of Colletotrichum species requires molecular analysis of multiple DNA regions, which can be time-consuming and costly.
4. Because species within the same clade share similar environmental requirements, a clade-based calibration may be useful in overcoming knowledge gaps for single Colletotrichum species, making predictions for a wide range of hosts and climatic conditions, and favoring practical model usage when species identification is not possible due to capacity or economic limitations.

Overall, the passage suggests that clade-based calibration can be a useful approach for understanding and predicting the behavior of anthracnose diseases caused by Colletotrichum species, even when species-specific information is limited or unavailable.

Answer 39 :
This appears to be a scientific text discussing the characteristics of Colletotrichum spp., a genus of fungi that cause anthracnose diseases. The text mentions that Colletotrichum spp. exhibit different lifestyles, including necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic, with hemibiotrophic being the most common. However, all species have a necrotrophic stage, except for a few that live entirely as endophytes.

The text also discusses the timing of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy, which depends on factors such as the host, its growth stage, environmental conditions, and phylogenetic clade. For example, the graminicola and destructivum clades have a short biotrophic period, while the acutatum and orbiculare clades have a longer biotrophic period.

The text includes a figure (Figure 7) that shows the predicted and observed disease progress on dry bean for the orbiculare clade in Morden, Manitoba, Canada, in 2015. The figure includes graphs of weather variables such as air temperature, relative humidity, rainfall, and wetness duration.
