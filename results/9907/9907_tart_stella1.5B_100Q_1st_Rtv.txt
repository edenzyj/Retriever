Strawberries (Fragaria×ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

To address the inadequacies of traditional identification methods, molecular techniques have been employed to characterize and identify taxa within Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Abang et al., 2002; Moriwaki et al., 2002; Peres et al., 2002; Guerber et al., 2003; Photita et al., 2005; Du et al., 2005; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Whitelaw-Weckert et al., 2007; Peres et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a-c). Cannon et al. (2000) noted that nucleic acid analyses provide a reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. The combined use of molecular diagnostic tools alongside traditional morphological techniques is currently an effective approach for studying Colletotrichum species complexes (Cannon et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2009).

Colletotrichum siamense, part of the gloeosporioides complex, was also notable, representing 11% of total isolates causing anthracnose in chili fruit in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but it was not detected in Malaysia and Taiwan. Nonetheless, Noor and Zakaria (2018) reported the identification of C. siamense in Malaysia, likely due to a larger sampling size of infected chili across various states. Within the C. siamense clade, small subclades were observed that corresponded with different geographical regions from which the isolates were collected. C. siamense has been reported to infect chili in Asia, Australia, and Brazil, and is a common pathogen of many other plant species (Weir et al. 2012; James et al. 2014; Sharma and Shenoy 2014; Liu et al. 2016a, 2016b; de Oliveira et al. 2017; De Silva et al. 2017a; Diao et al. 2017; Suwannarat et al. 2017).

In Supplementary Figure S2, one isolate with the strongest pathogenic ability from each species was presented: C. fructicola (HJD-49), C. siamense (HJD4-7), C. gloeosporioides (GT-10), and C. aenigma (nbg-18). HJD-49 (C. fructicola) exhibited strong pathogenicity on both wounded and non-wounded leaves. Among C. siamense, which was the first species reported on strawberry in Zhejiang, only a small portion of isolates, such as HJD4-7, caused similar disease on both types of leaves.

In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).

Strawberry anthracnose, primarily caused by C. nymphaeae within the C. acutatum complex, is a leading disease limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012; Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al. 2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acutatum infections include flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b; Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Infected flowers may display brown lesions on the petals, while infected fruits typically present dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on their surface, rendering them undesirable for consumption (Peres et al. 2005). During severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur in nurseries, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit production (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).

Result 8 :
A sexual morph was described for C. acutatum (Guerber & Correll 1997, 2001), based on mating-compatible strains in the laboratory. The cross designated as the type of Glomerella acutata was based on two cultures, ATCC 56816 and ATCC MYA-662. The first of these is derived from one of Simmonds’ original Queensland collections from papaya, IMI 117620, which is here designated as the epitype of C. acutatum. However, there is ongoing confusion regarding the provenance of this strain; Guerber & Correll (2001) and Than et al. (2008b) incorrectly equated ATCC 56816 with IMI 117617, the holotype, and this congruence is recorded as such in the ATCC catalog. The second strain, ATCC MYA-662, was isolated from apple in Louisiana, USA (Guerber & Correll 2001), and is assigned here to C. fioriniae in clade 3. Fertile sexual morphs were also produced by Guerber & Correll (2001) and Guerber et al. (2003) by mating a series of different strains, including crosses between parents both assigned to C. fioriniae. None of the strains tested was self-fertile.

Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.

Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).

Result 11 :
Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32°C (Salotti et al., 2022).

In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

The Bayesian tree obtained in this study indicates high genetic variability among the species occurring in Brazil, which is important for developing control strategies. A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides. Accurate identification of pathogens enhances our understanding of their epidemiology and infection strategies, providing valuable knowledge for breeding resistant cultivars.

Molecular Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis: Colletotrichum spp. isolates were first identified at the species complex level. Among the 52 Colletotrichum spp. isolates sampled from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan, 45 (86.5%) isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 4 (7.7%) belonged to the C. boninense species complex, and 3 (5.8%) belonged to the C. acutatum species complex.

From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

The analysis included single gene and multilocus DNA sequence analyses combining seven loci (ITS, CAL, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and HIS3), commonly used in previous phylogenetic studies of the C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. boninense species complexes (Damm et al. 2012a, b; Weir et al. 2012; Bragança et al. 2016).

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.

Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species—C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae—are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.

Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.

Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 × 2.3 – 4.9 × 0.7 μm versus 14.2 × 1.1 – 4.1 × 0.34 μm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 × 2.5 – 5.5 × 1.0 μm versus 7.5 × 1.0 μm).

The aims of this study were to (1) identify Colletotrichum species with straight conidia (cylindrical and fusiform) causing anthracnose in selected regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, and (2) determine the pathogenicity of these species on chili.

In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.

The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.

Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.

Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

The effects of temperature on the sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae, the causes of anthracnose in strawberries, were determined through controlled-environment studies. Detached immature fruits were inoculated with a conidial suspension and incubated for up to 36 days at constant temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C. The latent period (the time until the first sporulation) varied with temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25°C to 6 to 17 days at 5°C. At lower temperatures (5 and 10°C), C. acutatum exhibited a shorter latent period compared to the other species, while at higher temperatures, the latent periods among the species were similar.

A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.

Pathogenicity tests conducted using three species of Colletotrichum isolates demonstrated that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits during wound-inoculation studies. The symptoms exhibited varied significantly based on factors such as fruit variety, environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), and inoculum concentration (Freeman et al. 1998). Consequently, the findings of this study may not fully capture the virulence potential of these species. Further research is recommended to explore the virulence of Colletotrichum species under field conditions with natural inoculum, rather than relying solely on in vitro artificial inoculation.

Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

Disease Etiology and Host Specificity Determining the specific species of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose is critical for effective disease management. Relying solely on the species-host combination can be misleading. Therefore, taxonomic identification and characterization of subpopulations are essential to establish a clear understanding of disease dynamics.

A combination of multilocus phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics, and Koch’s postulates provides an effective strategy for the identification and characterization of fungal species. We demonstrated that molecular analysis of at least two loci (ITS and TUB2) enables accurate identification of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease in mangoes from central Thailand. This study represents the first report that C. asianum and C. siamense were identified as causative agents of mango anthracnose.

From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is recognized as a primary pathogen affecting Citrus sp., Mangifera sp., and Vitis vinifera, among many other host species, due to its classification as a species complex. The present study identified C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. musae, C. siamense, and C. tropicale as part of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. These results support previous findings that this complex is a predominant group of Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

The document notes that Colletotrichum asianum can be distinguished from C. fructicola and C. siamense—both of which also affect coffee plants—by its significantly slower growth rate (Prihastuti et al., 2009). The utility of physiological characteristics in differentiating closely related Colletotrichum species has been established in some cases, but such assessments have not been conducted for most species within this genus. The authors suggest that carbohydrate utilization and relative growth rates should be considered as polyphasic characters for studying Colletotrichum, especially for morphologically similar species that display phylogenetic distinctions.

Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

Result 44 :
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, is responsible for major losses in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) production worldwide. Fruit rot and flower blight are common symptoms in fruiting fields, while lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are particularly damaging in plant nurseries. C. acutatum may also cause crown rot and plant death in some regions. The pathogen is apparently introduced into production fields on infected or infested propagation material. During warm, moist periods, lesions formed on transplants produce abundant conidia that are splash dispersed onto flowers and fruits, resulting in new infections. However, when epidemics develop in fields where symptomless propagation material was planted, the source of initial inoculum is not clearly identifiable. Eastburn and Gubler suggested that the fungus is transported in infested soil attached to strawberry crowns, but the form and fate of fungal propagules from this potential inoculum source were not reported. Several studies have suggested that C. acutatum can develop quiescent infections on strawberry plants, but the epidemiological role of such infections prior to colonization of fruits and senescing foliage has not been investigated.

The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).

Four C. acutatum isolates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom development could be affected by the source of the isolate. The tested isolates, regardless of their origin, caused typical anthracnose symptoms on petioles, leaves, and stolons of both Chandler and Sharon cultivars 7 to 10 days after inoculation. After 30 days, 100% mortality was observed in all foliar-inoculated plants, compared to 0% mortality in the water control plants, which remained healthy thereafter.

Anthracnose of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) has become a major constraint on strawberry production in the United States. While C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae are often associated with infection of plant parts other than the fruit, both species are capable of infecting and rotting the fruit, leading to significant yield losses. The extensive use of fungicides is often necessary to manage this disease, and methods to reduce the number of spray applications or optimize the timing of fungicide applications are needed.

Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].

Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan.

As our understanding of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has improved, so has our capacity to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have led to reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly decreased losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. The introduction of partially resistant cultivars has also helped mitigate economic losses due to these diseases. Nonetheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental conditions are highly conducive to anthracnose development.

Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019).

The names of the Colletotrichum species used in previous studies need to be re-examined in light of a re-assessment of some of these species (Shivas and Tan, 2009). Ideally, papers epitypifying plant pathogenic taxa should include pathogenicity testing; however, this has not usually been done (e.g., Shenoy et al., 2007; Cannon et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a; Crouch et al., 2009b; Weir and Johnston, in press).

The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.

Investigations into anthracnose in the United States have focused on its epidemiology and the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species regarding their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics, infection processes, and pathogenicity. Findings from these studies have enhanced our understanding of the diseases and improved disease control strategies. Strawberries grown in high-nitrogen soils are more susceptible to anthracnose than those grown in lower nitrogen conditions or those amended with calcium nitrate. The disease spreads more rapidly in fields with overhead irrigation and plastic mulch compared to those using drip irrigation and straw mulch.

Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O’Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.

The distribution of Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose in chili varies across different countries that cultivate this crop. For instance, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), while only three species have been reported in Thailand (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018) and five in Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b). The main Colletotrichum species known to cause anthracnose in chili are primarily from the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes. Recently, additional species from the boninense and orchidarium complexes have also been implicated (Diao et al. 2017; Damm et al. 2019). Therefore, understanding the taxonomy, diversity, pathogenicity, and distribution of Colletotrichum species affecting chili is essential.

To assess the pathogenicity toward strawberry rhizomes, 30 strawberry seedlings were planted in plastic pots and inoculated with a spore suspension. Each seedling was placed in a separate pot, to which 100 mL of spore suspension was added. Control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized water. Both the inoculated seedlings and the controls were maintained in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a 12-hour day/night cycle. Colletotrichum species were isolated from strawberry fruits, petioles, rhizomes, and stolons exhibiting typical anthracnose symptoms. A total of 121 isolates were obtained from the diseased samples and are deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection (CGMCC), Mae Fah Luang University Culture Collection (MFLUCC) in Thailand, and the China Agricultural University in Beijing, China.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).

Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for Colletotrichum spp. encompass cultural, biological, and chemical control measures. Cultural control practices include producing disease-free propagating materials, avoiding overhead irrigation, minimizing rain splashing through mulching, and managing weeds (Coelho et al., 2008; Saxena et al., 2016). It is also recommended to remove infected crop residues and any mummified or rotten fruits to reduce inoculum sources and disease spread.

In the traditional system of strawberry production, plants are grown in the ground, and crop rotation is essential. However, in recent cultivation systems, plants are continuously cultivated on elevated benches to improve production efficiency. This continuous cropping system usually increases weed populations and necessitates intensive herbicide applications, which can also enhance the risk of disease dissemination from weeds to strawberries. The present study demonstrated that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during the following cultivation season. While there are numerous sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, the increase of pathogens on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.

Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characteristics. Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always sufficient for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species due to variations in morphology and phenotype influenced by environmental factors.

Result 70 :
Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).

Strawberry anthracnose, primarily caused by C. nymphaeae within the C. acutatum complex, is a leading disease limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012; Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al. 2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acutatum infections include flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b; Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Infected flowers may display brown lesions on the petals, while infected fruits typically present dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on their surface, rendering them undesirable for consumption (Peres et al. 2005). During severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur in nurseries, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit production (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).

Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.

The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.

C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.

Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].

The role of epiphytic stages and quiescent infections in the survival of the fungus Colletotrichum acutatum is not fully understood, particularly concerning the many diseases it causes. For instance, in the case of postbloom fruit drop in citrus, appressoria on mature tissues are essential for the pathogen's survival. Since flowers are the only susceptible tissues and occur only seasonally, the fungus survives as appressoria and quiescent infections on mature leaves. When flowers appear, leachates from the flowers induce the germination of appressoria and the production of conidia, which can then infect new flowers.

Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.

Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

None of the morphological characters of C. boninense allow for unequivocal identification, and misplacement of strains based solely on morphology is common. For instance, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological features but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study indicates that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. but rather to the C. boninense species complex, although its conidia largely resemble those of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio.

Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.

Symptomless foliage harbors inoculum for fruit and flower infections by several Colletotrichum species (7, 21, 28). Pantidou and Schroeder (21) demonstrated that conidia of C. phomoides harvested from symptomless tomato leaves could cause infections on tomato fruit. In citrus, C. acutatum survives on leaves as quiescent appressoria (28, 30), which can be stimulated to germinate and produce secondary conidia, serving as inoculum for flower infections. It has also been suggested that quiescent infections on strawberry leaves may provide inoculum for strawberry anthracnose epidemics (23). However, the potential for inoculum production on symptomless strawberry leaves has not been investigated. A better understanding of the ecology of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage before the onset of fruit rot symptoms may yield insights to improve management strategies for strawberry anthracnose.

Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 × 2.3 – 4.9 × 0.7 μm versus 14.2 × 1.1 – 4.1 × 0.34 μm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 × 2.5 – 5.5 × 1.0 μm versus 7.5 × 1.0 μm).

In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.

The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.

In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).

Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.

The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).

Abstract: Colletotrichum species are known plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes affecting various economically important hosts. However, the specific species impacting pear (Pyrus spp.) remain largely unidentified. This study aimed to determine the morphology, multi-gene phylogeny, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species associated with Pyrus plants. A total of 295 samples were collected from cultivated pear species (including P. pyrifolia, P. bretschneideri, and P. communis) across seven major pear cultivation provinces in China. Pear leaves and fruits affected by anthracnose were sampled and subjected to fungal isolation, resulting in 488 Colletotrichum isolates.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

Strawberries (Fragaria×ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).

Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

To address the inadequacies of traditional identification methods, molecular techniques have been employed to characterize and identify taxa within Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Abang et al., 2002; Moriwaki et al., 2002; Peres et al., 2002; Guerber et al., 2003; Photita et al., 2005; Du et al., 2005; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Whitelaw-Weckert et al., 2007; Peres et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a-c). Cannon et al. (2000) noted that nucleic acid analyses provide a reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. The combined use of molecular diagnostic tools alongside traditional morphological techniques is currently an effective approach for studying Colletotrichum species complexes (Cannon et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2009).

Colletotrichum siamense, part of the gloeosporioides complex, was also notable, representing 11% of total isolates causing anthracnose in chili fruit in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand, but it was not detected in Malaysia and Taiwan. Nonetheless, Noor and Zakaria (2018) reported the identification of C. siamense in Malaysia, likely due to a larger sampling size of infected chili across various states. Within the C. siamense clade, small subclades were observed that corresponded with different geographical regions from which the isolates were collected. C. siamense has been reported to infect chili in Asia, Australia, and Brazil, and is a common pathogen of many other plant species (Weir et al. 2012; James et al. 2014; Sharma and Shenoy 2014; Liu et al. 2016a, 2016b; de Oliveira et al. 2017; De Silva et al. 2017a; Diao et al. 2017; Suwannarat et al. 2017).

In Supplementary Figure S2, one isolate with the strongest pathogenic ability from each species was presented: C. fructicola (HJD-49), C. siamense (HJD4-7), C. gloeosporioides (GT-10), and C. aenigma (nbg-18). HJD-49 (C. fructicola) exhibited strong pathogenicity on both wounded and non-wounded leaves. Among C. siamense, which was the first species reported on strawberry in Zhejiang, only a small portion of isolates, such as HJD4-7, caused similar disease on both types of leaves.

In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).

Strawberry anthracnose, primarily caused by C. nymphaeae within the C. acutatum complex, is a leading disease limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012; Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al. 2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acutatum infections include flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b; Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Infected flowers may display brown lesions on the petals, while infected fruits typically present dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on their surface, rendering them undesirable for consumption (Peres et al. 2005). During severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur in nurseries, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit production (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).

Result 8 :
A sexual morph was described for C. acutatum (Guerber & Correll 1997, 2001), based on mating-compatible strains in the laboratory. The cross designated as the type of Glomerella acutata was based on two cultures, ATCC 56816 and ATCC MYA-662. The first of these is derived from one of Simmonds’ original Queensland collections from papaya, IMI 117620, which is here designated as the epitype of C. acutatum. However, there is ongoing confusion regarding the provenance of this strain; Guerber & Correll (2001) and Than et al. (2008b) incorrectly equated ATCC 56816 with IMI 117617, the holotype, and this congruence is recorded as such in the ATCC catalog. The second strain, ATCC MYA-662, was isolated from apple in Louisiana, USA (Guerber & Correll 2001), and is assigned here to C. fioriniae in clade 3. Fertile sexual morphs were also produced by Guerber & Correll (2001) and Guerber et al. (2003) by mating a series of different strains, including crosses between parents both assigned to C. fioriniae. None of the strains tested was self-fertile.

Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.

Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).

Result 11 :
Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32°C (Salotti et al., 2022).

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

The Bayesian tree obtained in this study indicates high genetic variability among the species occurring in Brazil, which is important for developing control strategies. A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides. Accurate identification of pathogens enhances our understanding of their epidemiology and infection strategies, providing valuable knowledge for breeding resistant cultivars.

Molecular Identification and Phylogenetic Analysis: Colletotrichum spp. isolates were first identified at the species complex level. Among the 52 Colletotrichum spp. isolates sampled from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan, 45 (86.5%) isolates belonged to the C. gloeosporioides species complex, 4 (7.7%) belonged to the C. boninense species complex, and 3 (5.8%) belonged to the C. acutatum species complex.

From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

The analysis included single gene and multilocus DNA sequence analyses combining seven loci (ITS, CAL, GAPDH, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and HIS3), commonly used in previous phylogenetic studies of the C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. boninense species complexes (Damm et al. 2012a, b; Weir et al. 2012; Bragança et al. 2016).

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.

Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species—C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae—are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.

Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.

Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 × 2.3 – 4.9 × 0.7 μm versus 14.2 × 1.1 – 4.1 × 0.34 μm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 × 2.5 – 5.5 × 1.0 μm versus 7.5 × 1.0 μm).

The aims of this study were to (1) identify Colletotrichum species with straight conidia (cylindrical and fusiform) causing anthracnose in selected regions of Indonesia, Malaysia, Taiwan, Thailand, and Sri Lanka, and (2) determine the pathogenicity of these species on chili.

In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited.

Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.

Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.

To address the inadequacies of traditional identification methods, molecular techniques have been employed to characterize and identify taxa within Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Abang et al., 2002; Moriwaki et al., 2002; Peres et al., 2002; Guerber et al., 2003; Photita et al., 2005; Du et al., 2005; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Whitelaw-Weckert et al., 2007; Peres et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a-c).

Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

The effects of temperature on the sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae, the causes of anthracnose in strawberries, were determined through controlled-environment studies. Detached immature fruits were inoculated with a conidial suspension and incubated for up to 36 days at constant temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35°C. The latent period (the time until the first sporulation) varied with temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25°C to 6 to 17 days at 5°C. At lower temperatures (5 and 10°C), C. acutatum exhibited a shorter latent period compared to the other species, while at higher temperatures, the latent periods among the species were similar.

A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.

Pathogenicity tests conducted using three species of Colletotrichum isolates demonstrated that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits during wound-inoculation studies. The symptoms exhibited varied significantly based on factors such as fruit variety, environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), and inoculum concentration (Freeman et al. 1998). Consequently, the findings of this study may not fully capture the virulence potential of these species. Further research is recommended to explore the virulence of Colletotrichum species under field conditions with natural inoculum, rather than relying solely on in vitro artificial inoculation.

Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

Disease Etiology and Host Specificity Determining the specific species of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose is critical for effective disease management.

A combination of multilocus phylogenetic analysis, phenotypic characteristics, and Koch’s postulates provides an effective strategy for the identification and characterization of fungal species.

From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is recognized as a primary pathogen affecting Citrus sp., Mangifera sp., and Vitis vinifera, among many other host species, due to its classification as a species complex. The present study identified C. asianum, C. cordylinicola, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. musae, C. siamense, and C. tropicale as part of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. These results support previous findings that this complex is a predominant group of Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30°C than at 25°C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25°C, 28°C, and 30°C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30°C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.

The document notes that Colletotrichum asianum can be distinguished from C. fructicola and C. siamense—both of which also affect coffee plants—by its significantly slower growth rate (Prihastuti et al., 2009). The utility of physiological characteristics in differentiating closely related Colletotrichum species has been established in some cases, but such assessments have not been conducted for most species within this genus. The authors suggest that carbohydrate utilization and relative growth rates should be considered as polyphasic characters for studying Colletotrichum, especially for morphologically similar species that display phylogenetic distinctions.

Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

Result 44 :
Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, is responsible for major losses in strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duch.) production worldwide. Fruit rot and flower blight are common symptoms in fruiting fields, while lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are particularly damaging in plant nurseries. C. acutatum may also cause crown rot and plant death in some regions. The pathogen is apparently introduced into production fields on infected or infested propagation material. During warm, moist periods, lesions formed on transplants produce abundant conidia that are splash dispersed onto flowers and fruits, resulting in new infections. However, when epidemics develop in fields where symptomless propagation material was planted, the source of initial inoculum is not clearly identifiable. Eastburn and Gubler suggested that the fungus is transported in infested soil attached to strawberry crowns, but the form and fate of fungal propagules from this potential inoculum source were not reported. Several studies have suggested that C. acutatum can develop quiescent infections on strawberry plants, but the epidemiological role of such infections prior to colonization of fruits and senescing foliage has not been investigated.

The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).

Four C. acutatum isolates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom development could be affected by the source of the isolate. The tested isolates, regardless of their origin, caused typical anthracnose symptoms on petioles, leaves, and stolons of both Chandler and Sharon cultivars 7 to 10 days after inoculation. After 30 days, 100% mortality was observed in all foliar-inoculated plants, compared to 0% mortality in the water control plants, which remained healthy thereafter.

Anthracnose of strawberry (Fragaria × ananassa Duchesne) has become a major constraint on strawberry production in the United States. While C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae are often associated with infection of plant parts other than the fruit, both species are capable of infecting and rotting the fruit, leading to significant yield losses. The extensive use of fungicides is often necessary to manage this disease, and methods to reduce the number of spray applications or optimize the timing of fungicide applications are needed. Disease forecasting, based on environmental conditions, may provide additional management strategies.

Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].

Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan. We hypothesized that various weeds growing in and around strawberry fields serve as inoculum sources for this disease. Additionally, we investigated the effect of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on these weeds.

As our understanding of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has improved, so has our capacity to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have led to reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly decreased losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. The introduction of partially resistant cultivars has also helped mitigate economic losses due to these diseases. Nonetheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental conditions are highly conducive to anthracnose development.

Result 55 :
Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

The names of the Colletotrichum species used in previous studies need to be re-examined in light of a re-assessment of some of these species (Shivas and Tan, 2009). Ideally, papers epitypifying plant pathogenic taxa should include pathogenicity testing; however, this has not usually been done (e.g., Shenoy et al., 2007; Cannon et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a; Crouch et al., 2009b; Weir and Johnston, in press).

Result 57 :
The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.

Investigations into anthracnose in the United States have focused on its epidemiology and the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species regarding their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics, infection processes, and pathogenicity. Findings from these studies have enhanced our understanding of the diseases and improved disease control strategies. Strawberries grown in high-nitrogen soils are more susceptible to anthracnose than those grown in lower nitrogen conditions or those amended with calcium nitrate. The disease spreads more rapidly in fields with overhead irrigation and plastic mulch compared to those using drip irrigation and straw mulch.

Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O’Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.

The distribution of Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose in chili varies across different countries that cultivate this crop. For instance, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), while only three species have been reported in Thailand (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018) and five in Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b). The main Colletotrichum species known to cause anthracnose in chili are primarily from the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes. Recently, additional species from the boninense and orchidarium complexes have also been implicated (Diao et al. 2017; Damm et al. 2019). Therefore, understanding the taxonomy, diversity, pathogenicity, and distribution of Colletotrichum species affecting chili is essential.

To assess the pathogenicity toward strawberry rhizomes, 30 strawberry seedlings were planted in plastic pots and inoculated with a spore suspension. Each seedling was placed in a separate pot, to which 100 mL of spore suspension was added. Control seedlings were inoculated with sterilized water. Both the inoculated seedlings and the controls were maintained in a growth chamber at 25 °C with a 12-hour day/night cycle. Colletotrichum species were isolated from strawberry fruits, petioles, rhizomes, and stolons exhibiting typical anthracnose symptoms. A total of 121 isolates were obtained from the diseased samples and are deposited in the China General Microbiological Culture Collection (CGMCC), Mae Fah Luang University Culture Collection (MFLUCC) in Thailand, and the China Agricultural University in Beijing, China.

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.

In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).

Integrated pest management (IPM) strategies for Colletotrichum spp. encompass cultural, biological, and chemical control measures. Cultural control practices include producing disease-free propagating materials, avoiding overhead irrigation, minimizing rain splashing through mulching, and managing weeds (Coelho et al., 2008; Saxena et al., 2016). It is also recommended to remove infected crop residues and any mummified or rotten fruits to reduce inoculum sources and disease spread.

In the traditional system of strawberry production, plants are grown in the ground, and crop rotation is essential. However, in recent cultivation systems, plants are continuously cultivated on elevated benches to improve production efficiency. This continuous cropping system usually increases weed populations and necessitates intensive herbicide applications, which can also enhance the risk of disease dissemination from weeds to strawberries. The present study demonstrated that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during the following cultivation season. While there are numerous sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, the increase of pathogens on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.

Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characteristics. Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always sufficient for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species due to variations in morphology and phenotype influenced by environmental factors.

Result 70 :
Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).

Strawberry anthracnose, primarily caused by C. nymphaeae within the C. acutatum complex, is a leading disease limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012; Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al. 2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acutatum infections include flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b; Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Infected flowers may display brown lesions on the petals, while infected fruits typically present dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on their surface, rendering them undesirable for consumption (Peres et al. 2005). During severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur in nurseries, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit production (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).

Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.

C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.

Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].

The role of epiphytic stages and quiescent infections in the survival of the fungus Colletotrichum acutatum is not fully understood, particularly concerning the many diseases it causes. For instance, in the case of postbloom fruit drop in citrus, appressoria on mature tissues are essential for the pathogen's survival. Since flowers are the only susceptible tissues and occur only seasonally, the fungus survives as appressoria and quiescent infections on mature leaves. When flowers appear, leachates from the flowers induce the germination of appressoria and the production of conidia, which can then infect new flowers.

Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.

Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens—C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae—are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species—C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii—identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

None of the morphological characters of C. boninense allow for unequivocal identification, and misplacement of strains based solely on morphology is common. For instance, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological features but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study indicates that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. but rather to the C. boninense species complex, although its conidia largely resemble those of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio.

Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1α) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.

Symptomless foliage harbors inoculum for fruit and flower infections by several Colletotrichum species (7, 21, 28). Pantidou and Schroeder (21) demonstrated that conidia of C. phomoides harvested from symptomless tomato leaves could cause infections on tomato fruit. In citrus, C. acutatum survives on leaves as quiescent appressoria (28, 30), which can be stimulated to germinate and produce secondary conidia, serving as inoculum for flower infections. It has also been suggested that quiescent infections on strawberry leaves may provide inoculum for strawberry anthracnose epidemics (23). However, the potential for inoculum production on symptomless strawberry leaves has not been investigated. A better understanding of the ecology of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage before the onset of fruit rot symptoms may yield insights to improve management strategies for strawberry anthracnose.

Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 × 2.3 – 4.9 × 0.7 μm versus 14.2 × 1.1 – 4.1 × 0.34 μm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 × 2.5 – 5.5 × 1.0 μm versus 7.5 × 1.0 μm).

In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.

The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.

In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).

Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.

Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is recognized as a primary pathogen affecting Citrus sp., Mangifera sp., and Vitis vinifera, among many other host species, due to its classification as a species complex.

The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.

The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2–3 days at 25 °C to 6–17 days at 5 °C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 °C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).

Abstract: Colletotrichum species are known plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes affecting various economically important hosts. However, the specific species impacting pear (Pyrus spp.) remain largely unidentified. This study aimed to determine the morphology, multi-gene phylogeny, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species associated with Pyrus plants. A total of 295 samples were collected from cultivated pear species (including P. pyrifolia, P. bretschneideri, and P. communis) across seven major pear cultivation provinces in China. Pear leaves and fruits affected by anthracnose were sampled and subjected to fungal isolation, resulting in 488 Colletotrichum isolates. Phylogenetic analyses based on six loci (ACT, TUB2, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, and ITS), along with morphological examinations of 90 representative isolates, revealed...

Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding.
