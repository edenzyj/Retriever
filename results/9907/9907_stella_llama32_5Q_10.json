            "Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) is a popular small fruit crop known for its high economic and nutritive value, and it is in high demand globally. From 2008 to 2018, the annual worldwide cultivation of strawberries increased from approximately 400 to 483 thousand hectares. Although strawberries are native to temperate regions, they can also be grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sometimes under high-altitude conditions. The land areas devoted to strawberry cultivation in Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Taiwan in 2018 were 1,482 ha, 1,453 ha, 690 ha, 522 ha, and 506 ha, respectively.",
            "Strawberries, perhaps the most delectable of fruits, are grown for their attractiveness and exquisite flavor in most temperate and many tropical areas of the world. Some believe the world would indeed be a dull place without strawberries to excite the taste buds and enliven desserts and pastries. Strawberry cultivation can be traced back thousands of years, with origins in Europe well documented in literature and art. Fragaria vesca L. (diploid, 2n=14 chromosomes) and F. moschata (hexaploid, 2n=42 chromosomes) were cultivated in palace and church gardens. Strawberry culture in the New World, particularly in North and South America, is less well documented. North American natives appreciated the springtime appearance of F. virginiana Duchesne (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) fruit, although this species was likely not cultivated until Europeans began exploring and settling in North America. However, native inhabitants of Chile and Peru had selected and cultivated superior variants of F. chiloensis (L.) Quebe- sene (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) well before the arrival of conquistadors in the 16th century.",
            "Strawberries (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).",
            "Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",
            "In Brazil, strawberries are typically cultivated during the dry winter season when irrigation is necessary. The traditional overhead sprinkler irrigation system has been the most popular among growers, but localized systems, such as drip irrigation and low-pressure tape irrigation, have become increasingly common. Localized irrigation, characterized by high application efficiency, is achieved through drip irrigation under plastic mulch or by surface low-pressure streams from plastic tapes. Although drip irrigation is recommended for improving fruit quality, it is more expensive and requires more maintenance than surface plastic tapes.",
            "Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa), native to South America, are widely cultivated in China, with cultivation areas increasing from 90,100 ha in 1985 to 330,000 ha in 2012. China produces 35.7% of all strawberries globally, making it the largest producer (Peng and Peng 2011). Zhejiang Province ranks among the top eight strawberry-producing regions in China (Shen 2014).",

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "In this study, most commercial cultivars, including \u2018Paros\u2019, \u2018Queen Eliza\u2019, \u2018N. Selva\u2019, and \u2018Camarosa\u2019, commonly grown in strawberry fields in Iran, were categorized as susceptible. Therefore, deploying relatively resistant cultivars such as \u2018Blackmore\u2019, \u2018Aliso\u2019, \u2018Mark\u2019, \u2018Diamant\u2019, and \u2018Yallova\u2019 could be effective in preventing disease development in regions where the disease is endemic. Additionally, cultivars with relative resistance may be crossed with commercial cultivars in breeding programs to improve and develop resistant varieties. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to evaluate the reaction of certain commercial strawberry cultivars against Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes strawberry AFR.",

It categorizes the cultivars into resistant and susceptible classes, with specific percentages indicating the incidence of fruit showing anthracnose lesions after inoculation. The table includes notations about the genotypes of the cultivars and their corresponding disease responses, showcasing a range from intermediate to susceptible levels of resistance.",
            "The excerpt discusses the evaluation of commercial strawberry cultivars' resistance to anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. It highlights the prevalence of anthracnose fruit rot in Iran and assesses the susceptibility of 52 commercial cultivars against the pathogen. The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",
            "Pathogenicity trials conducted over three years using 12 distinct C. gloeosporioides isolates and 10 strawberry cultivars identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates. However, they failed to identify any cultivar by isolate interactions. A more limited study using two C. fragariae isolates inoculated on six strawberry cultivars during the third year also identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates, but similarly did not reveal any cultivar by isolate interaction. When the resistance rankings of cultivars were compared between the two pathogen species, a small but significant cultivar by species interaction was observed.",

            "In the early 1980s, anthracnose became a significant disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States. In response, the USDA-ARS established a breeding program to develop anthracnose-resistant cultivars suited to the strawberry-growing regions of this area. This initiative was conducted at the Small Fruit Research Station in Poplarville, MS, and the Fruit Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, in collaboration with state experiment stations in Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina (Galletta et al., 1997; Smith and Spiers, 1982)."

            "Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.",

It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",

Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).",
            "Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, causing disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum, each with a brief description. In recent years, molecular tools have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Some species have been segregated from the C. gloeosporioides complex based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, such as C. boninense.",
            "The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",
            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",
