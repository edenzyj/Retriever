The analyses revealed 18 clades, which we accept as representing different Colletotrichum species. Notably, more than half of all strains included clustered in the first clade (C. karstii), which exhibited a bootstrap support of 96% and a Bayesian posterior probability value of 1.00. Two clades represented single strains, indicating...

Anthracnose crown rot, to which all currently cultivated strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) varieties are susceptible, represents a major disease affecting over 30% of nurseries and the post-transplanting stage in Korea (Nam et al., 2009). The causal pathogen, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, was first reported by Kim et al. (1992).
