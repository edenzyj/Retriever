Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm and humid  climates2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidemics of strawberry anthracnose  disease3. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, then penetrate the epidermal  cells4. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, causing black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, and wilting of the whole plant due to crown  rot2. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the  field2.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates, but knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. to investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018, and Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis with internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms/nurseries in taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species C. siamense and C. fructicola exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on wounded and non‑wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will help in disease management and resistance breeding.

Colletotrichum species are grouped into phylogenetic clades(also called “species complexes”) on the basis of multilocusmolecular analysis. Species within a clade are closely related toeach other (Cannon et al., 2012; Vieira et al., 2020; Talhinhas andBaroncelli, 2021) and have similar temperature requirements(Salotti et al., 2022). A recent systematic review of the taxonomyand of the phylogenetic clades of the genus identified 15 majorclades and a number of small clusters and isolated species(Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021). Detailed descriptions of majorphylogenetic clades and the list of species in each clade wereprovided by Cannon et al. (2012); Vieira et al. (2020); Talhinhasand Baroncelli (2021), Damm et al (2009; 2012; 2013; 2014), andWeir et al. (2012).

Genetic identification: ITS sequences do not reliably separate C. siamense from C. alienum, C. fructicola, or C. tropicale. These species are best distinguished using CAL or TUB2. Notes: Yang et al. (2009) and Wikee et al. (2011) discussed genetic and morphological differences between C. siamense, C. jasminisambac, and C. hymenocallidis. However, both studies used a limited set of isolates within the C. gloeosporioides complex, making interpretation of the genetic differences difficult. The morphological differences they described are commonly seen as within-species variation in other Colletotrichum spp. In our analysis, C. siamense is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from several tropical regions, and forms a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided genetically. Variation in cultural appearance is broad but in part this probably reflects the different conditions under which the isolates had been stored. Shape and size of appressoria, and the characteristically small conidia are similar in all isolates. Based on matching translation elongation factor (TEF) and TUB2 sequences, isolates referred by Rojas et al. (2010) to Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2 also represent C. siamense. Note that TEF data was excluded from our phylogenetic analyses because the TEF gene tree was often incongruent with the trees from the other genes that we sequenced. For example, compare our isolate ICMP 17797 (GenBank GU174571) with isolates Rojas et al. (2010) cite as Colletotrichum sp. indet. 2, V1H1_1 (GenBank GU994297) and 7767 (GenBank GU994298). The C. siamense protologue designates the holotype as MFLU 090230, but the culture derived from holotype as “BCC” with no specimen number. The ex-holotype culture is listed as BDP-I2 in Table 1 of Prihastuti et al. (2009) but not in the description of the species. Strain BDP-I2 was obtained from the authors (Prihastuti et al. 2009) for this study and deposited as ICMP 18578.

Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C. gloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently host-specialised, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these authors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to understand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host species, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria, growth rate in culture, colour of cultures, presence or absence of setae, whether or not the teleomorph develops, etc. Some studies have found characters such as these useful for distinguishing groups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956, Hindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems arise because many of these morphological features change under different conditions of growth (dependent upon growth media, temperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or change with repeated subculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled — even good, welldefined pathogens causing a specific disease can be isolated by chance from other substrates (e.g. Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum conidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium, remain attached to that surface as a viable propagule or perhaps as a minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow out from there into senescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity. In addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct sets of isolates, the shared pathogenicity presumably independently evolved, e.g. the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members of both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes (Johnston et al. 2005). Sutton (1992) commented on C. gloeosporioides that “No progress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging to this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone”. A start was made towards a modern understanding of this name with the designation of an epitype specimen with a culture derived from it to stabilise the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs in a strongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have been confused with C. gloeosporioides in the past, such as C. acutatum and C. boninense (e.g. Abang et al. 2002, Martinez-Culebras et al. 2003, Johnston et al. 2005, Chung et al. 2006, Farr et al. 2006, Than et al. 2008). However, biological and genetic relationships within the broad C. gloeosporioides clade remain confused and ITS sequences alone are insufficient to resolve them.

Result 7 :
Historically, C. acutatum has been considered to be the anthracnose fruit-rottingpathogen, and C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides have been associated with petiole andstolon lesions and crown rot; however, allthree species may cause similar symptomsand may be found to occur on the same plant(Howard et al., 1992). Identification of thesepathogens should be based on classical taxonomic characteristics or molecular techniques, not symptoms.

Result 8 :
Colletotrichum spp. have traditionally been classified based on the shape of the conidia and appressorium, the presence of a seta or perithecium, and culture  characteristics6,7. Using these criteria, early studies reported C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae as strawberry anthracnose  pathogens2,8. However, Colletotrichum spp. share similar features, and morphological characteristics can be influenced by environmental factors including culture media, light, and  temperature9−11. Therefore, a polyphasic approach based on morphology and genetic characteristics was proposed for identification of Colletotrichum  species9. A combination of multiple gene sequences, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT ), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), can provide more molecular features to resolve different species in a Colletotrichum species  complex12,13. Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex) and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex)6,12–18.

Rain splash is the primary means bywhich Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spreadfrom plant to plant in the field. Maddenand Boudreau (1997) found that anthracnosefruit rot incidence generally declined as plantdensity increased and concluded that plantdensity reduced the amount of rain thatpenetrated the plant canopy, thus reducingthe amount of splash. Most fruit infectionoccurred in a 25-cm radius of the source ofthe inoculum, an infected fruit (Madden andWilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999)studied splash dispersal of the conidia of thethree Colletotrichum spp. and found thatconidia of C. fragariae dispersed over theshortest distance and those of C. acutatumdispersed over the longest distance. This wasprobably due to the greater amount of sporesproduced on infected fruit by C. acutatum.

This genus is widely distributed in tropical and subtropical regions as well as in temperateand Mediterranean areas. Common hosts range from high-value crops like strawberry,olive, apple, and grape, to staple food crops grown by subsistence farmers in developingcountries like sorghum and cassava (Pastor-Corrales and Frederiksen, 1978; Peres et al.,2005; Sangpueak et al., 2018). Many Colletotrichum species are primarily reported as causalagents of anthracnose, which is also known by other names, like bitter rot on apple and ripefrontiersin.org01https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092/fullhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-sciencehttps://www.frontiersin.orghttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092&domain=pdf&date_stamp=2023-03-29mailto:vittorio.rossi@unicatt.ithttps://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#editorial-boardhttps://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-science#editorial-boardhttps://doi.org/10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092https://www.frontiersin.org/journals/plant-scienceSalotti et al. 10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092rot on grape (Dowling et al., 2020). In addition to causing severeyield losses, anthracnose epidemics can reduce the quality of theproduce (Waller et al., 2002; Dowling et al., 2020). Blossom blightand fruit rots are often the main economically damaging symptoms;however, necrotic lesions can also appear on leaves, stems, andtwigs, leading to the deterioration of plants and a reduction in fruitquality (Dowling et al., 2020).

Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to be C. gloeosporioides19, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Plant Protection Information System; https ://otser v2.tactr i.gov.tw/ppm/), but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and sequences of these species is not sufficient for species identification. Recently, based on analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown  rot5. To provide accurate information for disease control and resistance breeding, in this study we aimed to reveal the population composition of the infectious agents associated with strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan. Samples collected from the major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan from 2010 to 2018 were subjected to morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at different temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium as well as the ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the  UK14 and China [Anhui, Hainan (only one isolate), Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces and Beijing and Shanghai  cities]16–18, which, with the exception of Hainan, are geographical regions located at higher latitudes (30–53°N) relative to Taiwan (24.5°N), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose disease in subtropical regions.

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex151von Arx (1957), it has continued to be used in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. It was accepted as distinct by Sutton (1992), although he noted confusion surrounding application of the name. Designation of one of Brook’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has allowed a modern, genetic basis for this name to be fixed. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae sits in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a wide range of hosts from many parts of the world, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, an earlier name for C. fragariae in the sense that we accept these species in this paper. There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex which inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) isolates that genetically match the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on strawberry. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA (Fig. 1), further work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.Xie et al. (2010b) provides a good example of the confusion that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated. Xie et al. (2010b) found 4 groups of isolates, each with a slightly different ITS sequence, two of those groups they considered to be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates as either C. fragariae of C. gloeosporioides they used a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment, one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS sequences only — the genetic differences between some of these species are small and are indicative only of possible relationships. However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. There are also several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).

Box 287, Poplarville, MS 39470Additional index words. Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, Fragaria ·ananassa, disease control, fungicidesAbstract. Three Colletotrichum species—Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (teleomorph Glomerella acutata J.C.Guerber & J.C. Correll), Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. inPenz. [teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk]—are major pathogens of strawberry (Fragaria·ananassa). Strawberry anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease in commercial strawberry fields in thesoutheastern United States since the 1930s. The causal fungus, C. fragariae, may infect all aboveground plant parts;however, the disease is most severe when the fungus infects the crown, causing crown rot, wilt, and death. Colletotrichumgloeosporioides was responsible for an epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry nurseries in Arkansas and NorthCarolina in the late 1970s. The anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported in 1986 on strawberry in theUnited States. Since the 1980s, increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the United States may be relatedto changes in cultivars and to widespread use of annual plasticulture production rather than the matted-row productionsystem. Anthracnose investigations in the United States have concentrated on its epidemiology and differences among thethree causal Colletotrichum spp. in their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics; their infection processes;and their pathogenicity. Results from these studies have resulted in a better understanding of the diseases and have led tobetter disease control. Strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels are more susceptible to anthracnose than arethose grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those amended with calcium nitrate. Anthracnose is spread more rapidlyin fields that have overhead irrigation and plastic mulch than in fields where drip irrigation and straw mulch are used.

Because Colletotrichum spp. may infectmany other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields sometimes is assumed to comefrom these other hosts growing near thestrawberry field. To test the hypothesis thatColletotrichum spp. may move from otherfruit or vegetable hosts to strawberry, 37Colletotrichum isolates, representing ninespecies collected from 12 hosts, werewound-inoculated onto the leaves and stemsof strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith,2002). Colletotrichum fragariae isolates70 HORTSCIENCE VOL. 43(1) FEBRUARY 2008were the most aggressive and caused lesionsat an average of 38% of inoculation sites onall hosts except pepper. Percentages of infection for the other species were 25% Colletotrichum capsici, 18% C. gloeosporioides, 15%C. acutatum, 11% C. destructivum, 9% C.truncatum, 8% C. coccodes, 6% C. higginsianun, and 5% C. orbiculare. Strawberry wasthe most susceptible host with 58% of petioleand 14% of leaf inoculations of all isolatesresulting in lesion development. Pepper wasthe most resistant host with no symptomdevelopment on leaves or stems followinginoculation with any isolate. These resultssuggest that primary anthracnose infectionsin strawberry fields are most often frominfected strawberry transplants and only rarelyfrom other diseased fruit or vegetable hosts.

Genetic identification: ITS distinguishes C. horii from all other species. Specimens examined: See Weir & Johnston (2010). Colletotrichum hymenocallidis Yan L. Yang, Zuo Y. Liu, K.D. Hyde & L. Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138. 2009. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, also described from Hymenocallis, primarily on the basis of a multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony colour. Although gene selection was appropriate for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates were genetically distinct from the C. siamense isolates. However, in our analysis, in which the C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from all over the world, authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically. The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype but the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium specimen GZAAS 080001 as the holotype.

In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and  chili44,45, C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and  mango46,47, C. karstii in passion  fruit48, and C. boninense in  pitaya49. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum spp. from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could not only infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean but also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp.50. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum31. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize the primary infection in the field, it is worth investigating whether the five Colletotrichum spp. we identified could colonize the weeds commonly present in and nearby strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be required to understand the host range of the new species C. miaoliense.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other areas. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50–80%2,18,51,52. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings offer precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening of resistant varieties and development of effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether it was inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30 °C than 25 °C, which is meaningful in subtropical Taiwan and areas with a similar phenology. Because no significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, higher disease severity at 30 °C could be due to reduced resistance of strawberry against anthracnose at higher  temperatures53,54. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Development of temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be particularly important for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating the fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to aid the production of strawberry seedlings without latent infection of major Colletotrichum species.

To identify species in the C. gloeosporioides species complex, a combination of seven gene sequences (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL and ApMAT) from 45 isolates together with 47 reference isolates, including the outgroup sequence of C. boninense (CBS 123755), were used to construct phylogenetic trees (Table 1 and Supplementary Table S1). The final data matrix contained a total of 3,571 characters with gaps (ITS: 1–553, GAPDH: 554–808, CHS-1: 809–1,051, ACT : 1,052–1,325, TUB2: 1,326–2,028, CAL: 2,029–2,728, ApMAT: 2,729–3,571), of which 655 characters were parsimony informative, 735 parsimony uninformative, and 2,181 constant. After 6,574,000 generations of topological convergence via BI analysis, 9,864 trees were obtained. The first 25% of the trees were discarded, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, and the remaining trees were used to calculate the Bayesian posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree (Fig. 3). The ML analysis resulted in a best scoring RAxML tree with a final optimized likelihood value of − 18,514.217014. The most parsimonious tree resulted from the MP analysis received tree length = 2,400, CI = 0.722, and RI = 0.876. In single gene trees of TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT and the multilocus phylogenetic tree, 39 isolates clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 130417 and other related isolates of C. siamense (Fig. 3; single gene trees not shown). The 39 isolates formed a subclade with a high support value (1/100/98, BI/ML/MP) (Fig. 3). In single gene trees of GAPDH, ACT , TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT and the multilocus phylogenetic tree, six isolates clustered with strong statistical support in the clade containing the type strain CBS 130416 and other related isolates of C. fructicola (Fig. 3; single gene trees not shown).

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates, but knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. to investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018, and Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis with internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms/nurseries in taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species C. siamense and C. fructicola exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on wounded and non‑wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will help in disease management and resistance breeding.

pathogenicity assay. The susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ was used for all inoculation tests in this study. The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. (one isolate from each Colletotrichum species) was examined via Koch’s postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff  (106 spores/ml), and also applying 1 ml of spore suspension  (106 spores/ml) on the crown region after removal of one to two old leaves. After inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags (> 90% relative humidity) for 3 days at 30 °C and then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30 °C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod. The fungi were re-isolated from lesions of diseased tissues (as mentioned above using the single hypha tip isolation method), then identified based on morphological characteristics and ITS sequences as described above.

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex151von Arx (1957), it has continued to be used in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. It was accepted as distinct by Sutton (1992), although he noted confusion surrounding application of the name. Designation of one of Brook’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has allowed a modern, genetic basis for this name to be fixed. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae sits in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a wide range of hosts from many parts of the world, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, an earlier name for C. fragariae in the sense that we accept these species in this paper. There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex which inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) isolates that genetically match the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on strawberry. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA (Fig. 1), further work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.Xie et al. (2010b) provides a good example of the confusion that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated. Xie et al. (2010b) found 4 groups of isolates, each with a slightly different ITS sequence, two of those groups they considered to be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates as either C. fragariae of C. gloeosporioides they used a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment, one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS sequences only — the genetic differences between some of these species are small and are indicative only of possible relationships. However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. There are also several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).

Clade-based calibration may also have advantages. Anthracnosediseases have often been attributed to several Colletotrichum speciesbelonging to the same clade, depending on the region. For instance,the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are in the acutatumclade, with C. godetiae dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, andTunisia; with C. nymphaeae dominant in Portugal; and with C.fioriniae dominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). In addition,proper identification of the Colletotrichum species requiresmolecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009;Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Dammet al., 2014). Because the species belonging to the same clade showsimilar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a cladebased calibration may be useful to overcome knowledge gaps forsingle Colletotrichum species, to favor practical model usage whenthe identification of species is not possible because of capacity oreconomic limitations, and to make predictions for a wide range ofhosts and climatic conditions.

Cryptic taxa identification is progressing rapidly and groups of fungi, including important plant pathogens, are now mainly classified using molecular data-based phylogenetic inference. For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20  species12,13,21. Several Colletotrichum spp. with the capacity to cause strawberry anthracnose in temperate regions have been  reported12–15,17,22–30; however, knowledge of the composition of the pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. Through morphological characterization, phylogenetic analyses involving five to seven loci (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT), and inoculation tests on strawberry seedlings and detached leaves, the present study revealed that five Colletotrichum species cause strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan.

Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138. 2009. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, also described from Hymenocallis, primarily on the basis of a multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony colour. Although gene selection was appropriate for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates were genetically distinct from the C. siamense isolates. However, in our analysis, in which the C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from all over the world, authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically. The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype but the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium specimen GZAAS 080001 as the holotype.

Previous studies have shown correlations betweennitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose, as inthe case of cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Previously,Choi  et al . (2000) showed that, as tissue nitrogen contentdecreased, Ca and Mn contents, which have a direct rolein phenolic metabolism, increased in the strawberry. Manganese may increase synthesis of host defence productsand thereby reduce disease incidence and/or severity(Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993), whilst calcium has beenshown to inhibit anthracnose (caused by  C. gloeosporioides  or  C. acutatum ) in apples (Biggs, 1999) and decreasepostharvest disease development on strawberry (Cheour et al ., 1990).

Calcium may be important for resistance against certain cell-wall-degrading enzymes produced by fungal pathogens (Conway & Sams, 1984; Biggs& Peterson, 1990). However, in this study, no effect wasfound of calcium content on anthracnose disease in strawberry. As manganese content is increased under low nitrogen conditions in plants, additional work is needed todetermine whether manganese levels are related to anthracnose development.

Colletotrichum kahawae is an apparently clonal population (Varzea et al. 2002), widespread on coffee in Africa, and with a distinctive growth form and biology (Waller et al. 1993). In this paper C. kahawae sensu Waller et al. (1993) is reduced to subspecies. Based on ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, SOD2, and ITS gene sequences the coffee berry pathogen cannot be distinguished from isolates from a wide range of other hosts that are not pathogenic to coffee. Those other isolates are referred to here as C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro. We retain a distinct taxonomic label for the coffee berry pathogen to reflect its biosecurity importance.

This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings offer precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening of resistant varieties and development of effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether it was inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30 °C than 25 °C, which is meaningful in subtropical Taiwan and areas with a similar phenology. Because no significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, higher disease severity at 30 °C could be due to reduced resistance of strawberry against anthracnose at higher  temperatures53,54. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Development of temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be particularly important for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating the fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to aid the production of strawberry seedlings without latent infection of major Colletotrichum species.

CONCLUSIONSAs our knowledge of the anthracnosepathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our abilityto control these diseases. Changes in culturalpractices have resulted in reduced levels ofdisease. At the same time, development ofmore effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have greatlyreduced losses due to both anthracnose crownrot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars also have reduced economic losses dueto these diseases. Even so, growers maysustain severe losses when environmentalfactors are highly favorable for anthracnosedevelopment.

The pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. (one isolate from each Colletotrichum species) was examined via Koch’s postulates. Strawberry seedlings at the four- to five-leaf stage were inoculated by spraying a spore suspension on the leaves until runoff  (106 spores/ml), and also applying 1 ml of spore suspension  (106 spores/ml) on the crown region after removal of one to two old leaves. After inoculation, the seedlings were covered with plastic bags (> 90% relative humidity) for 3 days at 30 °C and then incubated in a growth chamber for 11 days at 30 °C and 70% relative humidity under a 12-h/12-h photoperiod.

Box 287, Poplarville, MS 39470Additional index words. Colletotrichum acutatum, C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, Fragaria ·ananassa, disease control, fungicidesAbstract. Three Colletotrichum species—Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds (teleomorph Glomerella acutata J.C.Guerber & J.C. Correll), Colletotrichum fragariae A.N. Brooks, and Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. inPenz. [teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk]—are major pathogens of strawberry (Fragaria·ananassa). Strawberry anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease in commercial strawberry fields in thesoutheastern United States since the 1930s. The causal fungus, C. fragariae, may infect all aboveground plant parts;however, the disease is most severe when the fungus infects the crown, causing crown rot, wilt, and death. Colletotrichumgloeosporioides was responsible for an epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in strawberry nurseries in Arkansas and NorthCarolina in the late 1970s. The anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported in 1986 on strawberry in theUnited States. Since the 1980s, increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the United States may be relatedto changes in cultivars and to widespread use of annual plasticulture production rather than the matted-row productionsystem. Anthracnose investigations in the United States have concentrated on its epidemiology and differences among thethree causal Colletotrichum spp. in their cultural, morphological, and molecular characteristics; their infection processes;and their pathogenicity. Results from these studies have resulted in a better understanding of the diseases and have led tobetter disease control. Strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels are more susceptible to anthracnose than arethose grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those amended with calcium nitrate. Anthracnose is spread more rapidlyin fields that have overhead irrigation and plastic mulch than in fields where drip irrigation and straw mulch are used.

This paper aims to clarify the genetic and taxonomic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides species complex using a set of isolates that widely samples its genetic, biological and geographic diversity. Type specimens, or cultures derived from type specimens, have been examined wherever possible. Although we do not treat all of the names placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & Müller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970), we treat all names for which a possible close relationship with C. gloeosporioides has been suggested in the recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata. ITS sequences, the official barcoding gene for fungi (Seifert 2009, Schoch et al. 2012), do not reliably resolve relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. We define species in the complex genetically rather than morphologically, on the basis of phylogenetic analyses of up to eight genes. Following Cannon et al. (2012, this issue) the generic name Colletotrichum is used as the preferred generic name for all species wherever possible throughout this paper, whether or not a Glomerella state has been observed for that fungus, and whether or not the Glomerella state has a formal name.

Clade-based calibration may also have advantages. Anthracnosediseases have often been attributed to several Colletotrichum speciesbelonging to the same clade, depending on the region. For instance,the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are in the acutatumclade, with C. godetiae dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, andTunisia; with C. nymphaeae dominant in Portugal; and with C.fioriniae dominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). In addition,proper identification of the Colletotrichum species requiresmolecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009;Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Dammet al., 2014). Because the species belonging to the same clade showsimilar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a cladebased calibration may be useful to overcome knowledge gaps forsingle Colletotrichum species, to favor practical model usage whenthe identification of species is not possible because of capacity oreconomic limitations, and to make predictions for a wide range ofhosts and climatic conditions.

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex151von Arx (1957), it has continued to be used in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. It was accepted as distinct by Sutton (1992), although he noted confusion surrounding application of the name. Designation of one of Brook’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has allowed a modern, genetic basis for this name to be fixed. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae sits in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a wide range of hosts from many parts of the world, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, an earlier name for C. fragariae in the sense that we accept these species in this paper. There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex which inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) isolates that genetically match the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on strawberry. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA (Fig. 1), further work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.Xie et al. (2010b) provides a good example of the confusion that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated. Xie et al. (2010b) found 4 groups of isolates, each with a slightly different ITS sequence, two of those groups they considered to be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates as either C. fragariae of C. gloeosporioides they used a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment, one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS sequences only — the genetic differences between some of these species are small and are indicative only of possible relationships. However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. There are also several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).

For instance, the removal of crop debris removal reduced by about30% the anthracnose severity in Ethiopian sorghum fields (Aragawet al., 2021). The use of resistant cultivars could be anenvironmentally friendly and cost-effective way to control thedisease (Saxena et al., 2016); however, available marketablecultivars often do not provide enough resistance to eliminate theneed for fungicides (Dowling et al., 2020). Biological control agents(BCAs), such as Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilus, have beenconsidered (Saxena et al., 2016; Dowling et al., 2020), but mostfarmers still prefer combining cultural practices and chemicalcontrol methods because of the variable efficacy of BCAs underfield conditions (Dowling et al., 2020). Calendar-basedapplication of chemicals, therefore, remains the main tool forcontrolling anthracnose diseases. This leads to intensive fungicidesprays, which may involve needless applications that are noteconomically or ecologically sustainable (Rossi et al., 2012).

Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C. gloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently host-specialised, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these authors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to understand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host species, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria, growth rate in culture, colour of cultures, presence or absence of setae, whether or not the teleomorph develops, etc. Some studies have found characters such as these useful for distinguishing groups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956, Hindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems arise because many of these morphological features change under different conditions of growth (dependent upon growth media, temperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or change with repeated subculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled — even good, welldefined pathogens causing a specific disease can be isolated by chance from other substrates (e.g. Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum conidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium, remain attached to that surface as a viable propagule or perhaps as a minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow out from there into senescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity. In addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct sets of isolates, the shared pathogenicity presumably independently evolved, e.g. the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members of both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes (Johnston et al. 2005). Sutton (1992) commented on C. gloeosporioides that “No progress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging to this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone”. A start was made towards a modern understanding of this name with the designation of an epitype specimen with a culture derived from it to stabilise the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs in a strongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have been confused with C. gloeosporioides in the past, such as C. acutatum and C. boninense (e.g. Abang et al. 2002, Martinez-Culebras et al. 2003, Johnston et al. 2005, Chung et al. 2006, Farr et al. 2006, Than et al. 2008). However, biological and genetic relationships within the broad C. gloeosporioides clade remain confused and ITS sequences alone are insufficient to resolve them.

Models have been developed to understand the epidemiology ofanthracnose on specific crops and to support infection-risk-basedfungicide applications (Dodd et al., 1991; Park et al., 1992; Monroeet al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh, 2020). Most of these models,however, are simple and consider only one component of thepathogen life cycle, mainly conidial infection, and only focus on asingle Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of thesemodels have never been validated against independent data (i.e.,data not used in model development). Contrary to these simplemodels, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, a highexplanatory ability, and the possibility of making predictions overa wide range of agricultural contexts; as a result, mechanistic modelsare considered useful for decision-making in IPM (De Wolf andIsard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al. (2021) developedand validated a mechanistic, weather-driven model for the ripe rotof grapes caused by the Colletotrichum species.

Genetic identification: ITS sequences distinguish C. xanthorrhoeae from all other species. Notes: This pathogen of Xanthorrhoea has a distinctive morphology, with a very slow growth rate in culture and large conidia which taper towards the basal end. The ascospore shape is distinct to that of most taxa within the C. gloeosporioides group, which typically have bent or curved ascospores. Specimens examined: Australia, Western Australia, Melville, on Xanthorrhoea preissii leaf spots, coll. F.D. Podger, Jan. 1994 (ex-holotype culture − BRIP 45094 = ICMP 17903 = CBS 127831); Queensland, Cunningham’s Gap, Main Ranges National Park, on Xanthorrhoea sp. leaf spot (IMI 350817a = ICMP 17820). DISCUSSION The species that we accept in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex together form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also be a problem. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarised the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts around the name C. gloeosporioides makes this a particular problem. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, that shows the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. See notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae for specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions. The species we accept are based on a phylogenetic species concept, all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal clades are recognised as named species. In most cases any well supported, within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the multi-gene phylogeny is not resolved consistently in all gene trees. This lack of congruence between gene trees is a signal that the diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although the concatenation of gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it masks discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach (Figs 3, 4B, 5B) combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesised to represent a single species, so that the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates is estimated. Fig. 3, shows the results of such an analysis for the C. gloeosporioides complex, Figs 4B and 5B show relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades respectively, at an expanded scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae clades. This may be because although the species-trees algorithms account for incomplete lineage sorting (Heled & Drummond 2010, Chung & Ané 2011), most do not compensate for horizontal gene transfer, reassortment, or introgression. Hybridisation could also result in discordant gene phylogenies. Hybrids are known in the C. acutatum complex, e.g. Glomerella acutata, a hybrid formed by crossing C. acutatum and C. fioriniae strains in the laboratory, and a putative hybrid strain between the same two species that had been collected from terminal crook disease on Pinus in New Zealand, where both species occur in nature (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Hybrids also form in the C. gloeosporioides complex, e.g. the Carya and Aeschynomene populations discussed by Cisar et al. (1994), more or less genetically equivalent to our species within the C. gloeosporioides complex.

Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other areas. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50–80%2,18,51,52. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings offer precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening of resistant varieties and development of effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether it was inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30 °C than 25 °C, which is meaningful in subtropical Taiwan and areas with a similar phenology. Because no significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25 °C, 28 °C, and 30 °C, higher disease severity at 30 °C could be due to reduced resistance of strawberry against anthracnose at higher  temperatures53,54. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar ‘Taoyuan No. 1’ has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Development of temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be particularly important for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating the fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to aid the production of strawberry seedlings without latent infection of major Colletotrichum species.

In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and  chili44,45, C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and  mango46,47, C. karstii in passion  fruit48, and C. boninense in  pitaya49. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum spp. from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could not only infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean but also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp.50. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum31. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize the primary infection in the field, it is worth investigating whether the five Colletotrichum spp. we identified could colonize the weeds commonly present in and nearby strawberry fields in Taiwan.

Cryptic taxa identification is progressing rapidly and groups of fungi, including important plant pathogens, are now mainly classified using molecular data-based phylogenetic inference. For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20  species12,13,21.

Through morphological characterization, phylogenetic analyses involving five to seven loci (ITS, GAPDH, CHS-1, ACT , TUB2, CAL, and ApMAT), and inoculation tests on strawberry seedlings and detached leaves, the present study revealed that five Colletotrichum species cause strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan.

Because Colletotrichum spp. may infectmany other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields sometimes is assumed to comefrom these other hosts growing near thestrawberry field. To test the hypothesis thatColletotrichum spp. may move from otherfruit or vegetable hosts to strawberry, 37Colletotrichum isolates, representing ninespecies collected from 12 hosts, werewound-inoculated onto the leaves and stemsof strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith,2002). Colletotrichum fragariae isolates70 HORTSCIENCE VOL. 43(1) FEBRUARY 2008were the most aggressive and caused lesionsat an average of 38% of inoculation sites onall hosts except pepper. Percentages of infection for the other species were 25% Colletotrichum capsici, 18% C. gloeosporioides, 15%C. acutatum, 11% C. destructivum, 9% C.truncatum, 8% C. coccodes, 6% C. higginsianun, and 5% C. orbiculare. Strawberry wasthe most susceptible host with 58% of petioleand 14% of leaf inoculations of all isolatesresulting in lesion development. Pepper wasthe most resistant host with no symptomdevelopment on leaves or stems followinginoculation with any isolate. These resultssuggest that primary anthracnose infectionsin strawberry fields are most often frominfected strawberry transplants and only rarelyfrom other diseased fruit or vegetable hosts.

Cai, Fungal Diversity 39: 138. 2009. Notes: Placed here in synonymy with Colletotrichum siamense. See notes and additional specimens examined under C. siamense. Yang et al. (2009) reported this species as a leaf pathogen of Hymenocallis americana. They distinguished C. hymenocallidis from C. siamense, also described from Hymenocallis, primarily on the basis of a multi-gene phylogeny and differences in colony colour. Although gene selection was appropriate for resolving genetic relationships within the C. gloeosporioides group, Yang et al. (2009) included only five isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex in their phylogeny. Based on this isolate selection, the C. hymenocallidis isolates were genetically distinct from the C. siamense isolates. However, in our analysis, in which the C. siamense/C. hymenocallidis group is represented by 30 isolates from a wide range of hosts from all over the world, authentic isolates of the two species fall within a monophyletic clade that cannot be further subdivided phylogenetically. The Latin part of the C. hymenocallidis protologue designates a culture (“Holotypus: Cultura (CSSN2)”) as the holotype but the English citation of the type specimen corrects this apparent mistake, citing CSSN2 as an ex-holotype culture, with the herbarium specimen GZAAS 080001 as the holotype.

www.studiesinmycology.orgThe ColletotriChum gloeosporioides species complex151von Arx (1957), it has continued to be used in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. It was accepted as distinct by Sutton (1992), although he noted confusion surrounding application of the name. Designation of one of Brook’s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has allowed a modern, genetic basis for this name to be fixed. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae sits in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a wide range of hosts from many parts of the world, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, an earlier name for C. fragariae in the sense that we accept these species in this paper. There are several species from the C. gloeosporioides complex which inhabit diseased strawberry plants, and as shown by MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) isolates that genetically match the epitype of C. fragariae have a wide host range. Despite its name MacKenzie et al. (2007, 2008) regarded this fungus as simply one of a group of several species sometimes found on strawberry. Our study confirms that members of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade occur throughout the world on a wide range of hosts. Within the diversity of the C. fragariae/theobromicola clade, there is a subclade consisting of the C. fragariae epitype and two contemporary ex-strawberry isolates from the USA (Fig. 1), further work will be needed to establish if the strawberry stolon disease is restricted to this subclade. Despite regular surveys this disease has not been found on strawberries in New Zealand.Xie et al. (2010b) provides a good example of the confusion that continues to surround the application of Colletotrichum names to isolates from strawberry. These authors noted that putative C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae isolates were difficult to distinguish using ITS sequences, the only sequences that they generated. Xie et al. (2010b) found 4 groups of isolates, each with a slightly different ITS sequence, two of those groups they considered to be C. fragariae and two to be C. gloeosporioides. To classify their isolates as either C. fragariae of C. gloeosporioides they used a restriction enzyme method based on Martinez-Culebras et al. (2000). Incorporating their ITS sequences into our ITS alignment, one of their groups genetically matches C. tropicale, one matches C. gloeosporioides s. str., one matches C. fructicola, and one matches C. siamense. These relationships are based on ITS sequences only — the genetic differences between some of these species are small and are indicative only of possible relationships. However, it is clear that none of the Xie et al. (2010b) sequences match those of the epitype of C. fragariae. There are also several species within the C. acutatum species complex associated with Fragaria (Damm et al. 2012, this issue).

The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts have similarcomponents (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they aregenerally polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia)responsible for the initiation and spread of the epidemics. OtherColletotrichum diseases have been described, causing crown rot ofstrawberry and black dot on tomato and potato roots (Dillard andCobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002).

Colletotrichum spp. have traditionally been classified based on the shape of the conidia and appressorium, the presence of a seta or perithecium, and culture  characteristics6,7. Using these criteria, early studies reported C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae as strawberry anthracnose  pathogens2,8. However, Colletotrichum spp. share similar features, and morphological characteristics can be influenced by environmental factors including culture media, light, and  temperature9−11. Therefore, a polyphasic approach based on morphology and genetic characteristics was proposed for identification of Colletotrichum  species9. A combination of multiple gene sequences, including internal transcribed spacer (ITS), glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT ), beta-tubulin (TUB2), calmodulin (CAL), and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT), can provide more molecular features to resolve different species in a Colletotrichum species  complex12,13. Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex) and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex)6,12–18.

Von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1980) distinguished the C. gloeosporioides group using conidial shape and size. A few apparently host-specialised, C. gloeosporioides-like taxa were retained by these authors, but the basis of their identification was often difficult to understand. Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts within Colletotrichum were based on features such as host species, substrate, conidial size and shape, shape of appressoria, growth rate in culture, colour of cultures, presence or absence of setae, whether or not the teleomorph develops, etc. Some studies have found characters such as these useful for distinguishing groups within C. gloeosporioides (e.g. Higgins 1926, Gorter 1956, Hindorf 1973, and Johnston & Jones 1997). However, problems arise because many of these morphological features change under different conditions of growth (dependent upon growth media, temperature, light regime, etc.), or can be lost or change with repeated subculturing. Host preference is poorly controlled — even good, welldefined pathogens causing a specific disease can be isolated by chance from other substrates (e.g. Johnston 2000). Colletotrichum conidia will germinate on most surfaces, form an appressorium, remain attached to that surface as a viable propagule or perhaps as a minor, endophytic or latent infection, and grow out from there into senescing plant tissue or onto agar plates if given the opportunity. In addition, the same disease can be caused by genetically distinct sets of isolates, the shared pathogenicity presumably independently evolved, e.g. the bitter rot disease of apple is caused by members of both the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes (Johnston et al. 2005). Sutton (1992) commented on C. gloeosporioides that “No progress in the systematics and identification of isolates belonging to this complex is likely to be made based on morphology alone”. A start was made towards a modern understanding of this name with the designation of an epitype specimen with a culture derived from it to stabilise the application of the name (Cannon et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences, the ex-epitype isolate belongs in a strongly supported clade, distinct from other taxa that have been confused with C. gloeosporioides in the past, such as C. acutatum and C. boninense (e.g. Abang et al. 2002, Martinez-Culebras et al. 2003, Johnston et al. 2005, Chung et al. 2006, Farr et al. 2006, Than et al. 2008). However, biological and genetic relationships within the broad C. gloeosporioides clade remain confused and ITS sequences alone are insufficient to resolve them.

Anthracnose spreads within a field bysplashing water, and living mulches (suchas wheat, rye, or rye grass) in row middleshave been shown to reduce disease spreadwithin a field. Sublethal doses of grassspecific herbicides such as sethoxydim, maybe used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, suchas wheat straw or pine needles, will alsoreduce splash and result in lower incidenceof anthracnose compared with rows mulchedwith plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith andSpiers, 1986). Anthracnose is less severewhen water is supplied to plants using dripirrigation rather than overhead irrigation(Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986).

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm and humid  climates2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidemics of strawberry anthracnose  disease3. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, then penetrate the epidermal  cells4. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, causing black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, and wilting of the whole plant due to crown  rot2. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the  field2. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, and the high temperature, high humidity and heavy rainfall during open1Miaoli District Agricultural Research and Extension Station, Council of Agriculture, Executive Yuan, Miaoli County  36346,  Taiwan.  2Department  of  Plant  Pathology  and  Microbiology,  National  Taiwan  University,  Taipei City 10617, Taiwan. *email: thhung@ntu.edu.tw; sst@ntu.edu.tw; clchung@ntu.edu.twhttp://crossmark.crossref.org/dialog/?doi=10.1038/s41598-020-70878-2&domain=pdf2Vol:.(1234567890)Scientific RepoRtS |        (2020) 10:14664  | https://doi.org/10.1038/s41598-020-70878-2www.nature.com/scientificreports/this period provide a suitable environment for epidemics.

Genetic identification: ITS separates C. gloeosporioides from all other species. Notes: The name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is currently in common use in two senses, one a genetically and biologically broad sense more or less following von Arx (1957, 1970) and Sutton (1992), including the whole species complex, the other a strict sense, encompassing only those specimens genetically matching the epitype selected for this name by Cannon et al. (2008). Depending on the context, use of the name in either sense can be useful. When used in a broad sense in this paper, it is referred to as the C. gloeosporioides species complex or C. gloeosporioides s. lat. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is often linked taxonomically to the teleomorph Glomerella cingulata, see notes under G. cingulata.

The greatest economic losses due toanthracnose on strawberry are from fruit rotcaused by C. acutatum, which also infectsmany other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernsteinet al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith,2002). The presence of the pathogen has beenreported on strawberries in almost all areasof the world where they are grown. Crowninfections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather thanMention of trade names or commercial products inthis article is solely for the purpose of providingspecific information and does not imply recommendation or endorsement by the U.S. Departmentof Agriculture.1To whom correspondence should be addressed;e-mail Barbara.Smith@ars.usda.govHORTSCIENCE VOL. 43(1) FEBRUARY 2008 69plant death.

150Colletotrichum cordylines Pollacci, Atti Ist. Bot. Univ. Pavia, Serie 2, 5: 44. 1899. Notes: Described from leaves of Cordyline indivisa from a botanical garden in Italy, the genetic and biological status of this species is not known. Two Cordyline-associated species are accepted in this study, C. cordylinicola from Thailand and the newly described C. ti from New Zealand. The original description of C. cordylines is brief (Pollacci 1899) but it specifically mentions setae more than 100 µm long. Colletotrichum cordylinicola is described as lacking setae (Phoulivong et al. 2011) and in C. ti they are rare and when present much less than 100 µm long. The phylogenetic significance of this apparent difference and confirmation that these names represent different fungi requires DNA sequences to be generated from type material of C. cordylines. * Colletotrichum cordylinicola Phoulivong, L. Cai & K.D. Hyde, Mycotaxon 114: 251. 2011 [“2010”]. Fig. 22. Phoulivong et al. (2011) provide a description. Geographic distribution and host range: Known only from Cordyline from Thailand and Eugenia from Laos. Genetic identification: ITS sequences separate C. cordylinicola from all other species. Notes: Phoulivong et al. (2011) report C. cordylinicola from Cordyline (Agavaceae) and Eugenia (Myrtaceae). They noted that the isolate from Eugenia was not pathogenic to Cordyline and vice versa, and they also showed that the specimens from the two hosts are genetically somewhat distinct, although forming a sister relationship amongst the taxa included in their analysis. The calmodulin gene tree generated from our sequence data together with the sequences provided by Phoulivong et al. (2011) (GenBank accession HM470236) supports placing the isolates from Eugenia and from Cordyline in the same species (unpubl. data). Colletotrichum cordylinicola is genetically distinct from a species associated with Cordyline leaf spots from New Zealand, described here as C. ti. See also notes under C. cordylines. Specimen examined: Thailand, Chiang Mai, Sam Sai District, Maejo Village, on Cordyline fruticosa, coll. S. Phoulivong, 15 Mar. 2009 (ex-holotype culture – MFLUCC 090551 = ICMP 18579). Note that the ex-holotype culture was mistakenly cited as MFUCC 090551 by Phoulivong et al. (2011). Colletotrichum crassipes (Speg.) Arx, Verh. Kon. Ned. Akad. Wetensch., Afd. Natuurk., Sect. 2, 51(3): 77. 1957. Basionym: Gloeosporium crassipes Speg., Rivista Vitic. Enol. 2: 405. 1878. Notes: Several isolates identified as Colletotrichum crassipes that have sequences accessioned to GenBank belong in C. gloeosporioides s. lat. GenBank accessions identified as C. crassipes that have a publically available culture include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (STE-U 5302 = CBS 112988 – AY376529, AY376577, FN557348, FN557538, and FN599821; STE-U 4445 = CBS 112984 – AY376530, AY376578, – FN557347, FN557537, and FN599820), along with several other species outside of the C. gloeosporioides complex (CBS 169.59 = IMI 309371 – AJ536230, FN557344, and FN599817; CBS 159.75 – FN557345 and FN599818; CBS 109355 – FN557346 and FN599819). Those with no isolates in a public collection include C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro (CORCS3 cited in Yang et al. (2011), HM584410, HM582002, HM585412), C. fructicola (strain 080912009 Jining, unpubl. data, FJ515007), and a possibly undescribed species within the Kahawae clade (strain SYJM02, unpubl. data, JF923835). Originally described from the berries of Vitis vinifera from Italy (Spegazzini 1878), the identity of C. crassipes remains unresolved. There is confusion regarding its morphology. Von Arx (1970) uses the name C. crassipes for fungi in which setae are rare, conidia are 22–34 × 6–8 µm (more or less matching the original description), and the lobed appressoria are distinctively globose in shape. Sutton (1980) uses a different morphological concept – setae common (according to Sutton these are rare in the otherwise morphologically similar C. musae), conidia 10–15 × 4.5–6.5 µm (Sutton’s concept of C. gloeosporioides is characterised by narrower conidia), and the appressoria deeply lobed. The conidial width cited for C. gloeosporioides by Sutton (1980), 3–4.5 µm, is narrower than we have found for all the taxa we accept within C. gloeosporioides s. lat., whereas his C. crassipes measurement of 4.5–6.5 µm matches many of the taxa we recognise. Several of these taxa also have deeply lobed appressoria.

Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates, but knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. to investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018, and Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis with internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms/nurseries in taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species C. siamense and C. fructicola exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on wounded and non‑wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will help in disease management and resistance breeding.
