Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm 
and humid  climates2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidem-
ics of strawberry anthracnose  disease3. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appres-
soria, then penetrate the epidermal  cells4. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, causing 
black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, 
and wilting of the whole plant due to crown  rot2. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange 
conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of 
up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the  field2. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings 
are propagated from March to September, and the high temperature, high humidity and heavy rainfall during

Duch.) are caused by the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum 
acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides 
(Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata 
(Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk) (8,21–23,26). All three species in-
cite diseases, which cannot be distinguished in the field by symp-
toms alone. Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown 
worldwide, but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they 
cause little injury to the plants. C. fragariae is most often associ-
ated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, 
humid areas such as the southeastern United States. Its host range 
is limited to strawberries and a few weeds (22). C. acutatum is the 
primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot, has a broader 
geographic and host range than C. fragariae (8,10,22), and is 
increasing in importance as a cause of petiole, stolon, crown, and 
root infections (7).
