Anthracnose pathogens infect not only fruits but also other plant organs, including leaves, flowers, twigs, and branches. The conidia and spores formed in these infected tissues are released and dispersed during rainy days or periods of high humidity, becoming the primary inoculum for fruit infection at the preharvest stage. The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions that contain conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions can merge to form larger lesions. These dark lesions on the fruit surface are unattractive to consumers and significantly reduce the market value of the affected fruits. Figures 2A\u2013E display anthracnose lesions on several tropical fruit crops.', 0.4940071702003479]]\nContext 1: [['Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.', 0.49226105213165283]]\nContext 2: [[\"Regarding pathogenicity and virulence to leaves and fruits, walnut fruits and leaves were inoculated with the 13 isolates.

Control fruits and leaves showed no symptoms seven days after inoculation with blank agar plugs (see Supplementary Fig. S2N). Typical symptoms included roughly circular or irregular spots, with infections appearing water-soaked, sunken, and brown to black. The black lesions expanded and developed into necrotic areas.

However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production.

Conidia from these acervuli are splash-dispersed, germinate to form appressoria, and establish quiescent infections on fruit, as demonstrated in peaches. These diseases can occur both in the field and post-harvest. However, most quiescent infections develop throughout the growing season. For blueberries, C. acutatum is also known to attack young leaves and other tissues, although this is rare. Thus, conidia from acervuli on leaves and decaying fruit may serve as a source of inoculum for other fruits, and the pathogen can survive as appressoria in bud scales and dead fruiting twigs. In apples, the source of inoculum is less obvious, as C. acutatum only causes disease on fruit. The fungus appears to be widespread in orchards and is easily isolated from both healthy and damaged tissue. In Michigan, where bitter rot is rare, C. acutatum remains prevalent in apple orchards and is commonly isolated, suggesting that it survives and reproduces as an epiphyte or endophyte, akin to the epiphytic\u2013short necrotroph lifestyle.', 0.26713815331459045]]\nContext 9: [[\"Anthracnose can occur in avocados wherever they are grown, particularly during the wet season and in areas with high rainfall.

Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009).

This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies.

During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae.

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.', 0.08233524113893509]]\nContext 7: [['The meeting provided substantial evidence of the rapid advancement in our understanding of Colletotrichum genomics.

In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.', 0.9697003364562988]]\nContext 3: [['In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.9328422546386719]]\nContext 4: [['In-vitro trials have been used to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose (LaMondia, 1993; McInnes et al., 1992b; Smith and Black, 1992).

Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.', 0.9972148537635803]]\nContext 3: [['Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby.

Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate.

ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.', 0.99674391746521]]\nContext 1: [['Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop.

Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.9941658973693848]]\nContext 2: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9929847717285156]]\nContext 3: [['Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931).

This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).', 0.9926043748855591]]\nContext 4: [[\"Supplementary Figure S1 provides a visual representation of anthracnose symptoms on strawberry plants, depicting various stages and characteristics of infection.

Petiole and stolon infections are characterized by dark, sunken lesions, while leaf infections present as small black spots. When the crown is infected, it can lead to wilting and rapid plant death. An internal symptom of a crown infection is red discoloration, typically extending in a \u201cV\u201d shape from the side of the crown toward the center. Other pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum also cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.', 0.991038978099823]]\nContext 8: [['Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).', 0.9898082613945007]]\nContext 9: [['Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990).

The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide.

Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986).

Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research.

Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single-gene identifications, which often led to identification at the species complex level rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton 1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae), became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010).

To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts.

Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields.

To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.', 0.9560196995735168]]\nContext 4: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9437209367752075]]\nContext 5: [['Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a significant disease affecting strawberry production. Surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected from affected areas, specifically strawberry nurseries and production fields in six states across the United States. The use of fungicides, particularly quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been widely employed for controlling C. acutatum for the past 20 years. Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group. This situation necessitates immediate changes in anthracnose management strategies to incorporate other chemical and non-chemical approaches, aiming to limit the selection of resistant populations and prevent future outbreaks.', 0.9403496384620667]]\nContext 6: [['In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.9115323424339294]]\nContext 7: [['Wedge, D.

Crop Prot., 26:1449-1458.', 0.8711495399475098]]\nContext 8: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.8486630320549011]]\nContext 9: [[\"Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.\", 0.8356462121009827]]\n"

Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.', 0.9566954374313354]]\nContext 3: [['Freeman, S.

Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.9271309971809387]]\nContext 5: [['Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.', 0.9706769585609436]]\nContext 1: [['On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).', 0.9326205849647522]]\nContext 2: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.8953297138214111]]\nContext 3: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8652259707450867]]\nContext 4: [['Four C. acutatum isolates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom development could be affected by the source of the isolate.

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1\u03b1) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.', 0.9939221143722534]]\nContext 1: [['The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA has frequently been used to differentiate Colletotrichum species (Freeman et al. 2000), though it has not always been satisfactory (Cannon et al. 2012).

Given the recent changes in the classification of Colletotrichum species and the limited information on the identity and characteristics of isolates causing mango anthracnose in China, the objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to identify and characterize species of Colletotrichum associated with mango anthracnose in Guangxi, China, based on morphology and DNA sequence comparisons; (ii) to examine the virulence of isolates from different parts of Guangxi province and assess whether there are geographical differences; and (iii) to investigate relationships among Colletotrichum spp. from mango using sequences of ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and GAPDH.', 0.988497793674469]]\nContext 2: [['A similar set of six genes (ITS, ACT, CHS, GPDH, histone 3, and beta-tubulin) was used by Damm et al.

The best separability of the species was observed using both GPDH and histone 3 genes, which were superior to ITS, ACT, CHS, and beta-tubulin. The most appropriate gene for barcoding Colletotrichum must be selected during the species delimitation process since we can only choose one or more barcoding genes when we know which taxa need to be distinguished.

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.', 0.9967830181121826]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide.

This extended summer contributed to the outbreak of several diseases, including anthracnose crown rot, leading to increased mortality after transplanting in strawberry production fields. It is concerning to speculate that global warming may exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, changes in temperature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the specific responses of the disease triangle to these variations (Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2018).

Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel indicated that populations of C. acutatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable levels (S. Freeman, unpublished data). Therefore, the likelihood of persistent soil contamination by a soilborne inoculum of C. acutatum appears low, especially since soil fumigation is a standard practice.', 0.678442120552063]]\nContext 2: [['Madden, L.V., Wilson, L.L., Ellis, M.A. 1993.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.', 0.27546319365501404]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.24533067643642426]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010).

Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9).

Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures.

Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8494832515716553]]\nContext 3: [['Three species have been reported as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum acutatum J.H.

Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997).

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan.

This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l.

Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts.

C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae.

They cause significant economic damage to crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by these pathogens. Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as anthracnose, characterized by sunken necrotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases can appear in both developing and mature plant tissues.', 0.9907642602920532]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is one of the main diseases affecting strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) production worldwide, causing significant yield losses and contributing to a large part of the fungicide schedule still adopted by Brazilian growers. Several species of Colletotrichum are associated with this disease, including C. fragariae, C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum. Symptoms manifest on fruit, buds, blossoms, petioles, runners, crowns, and foliage. However, the two most destructive forms of the disease are crown rot anthracnose, usually caused by C. fragariae and primarily affecting roots, crowns, and fruit, and flower blight and fruit rot caused by C. acutatum.', 0.7283815741539001]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.', 0.7032987475395203]]\nContext 3: [['Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has categorized Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly appear on aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.', 0.6927347183227539]]\nContext 4: [['The distribution of Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose in chili varies across different countries that cultivate this crop. For instance, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), while only three species have been reported in Thailand (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018) and five in Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b). The main Colletotrichum species known to cause anthracnose in chili are primarily from the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes. Recently, additional species from the boninense and orchidarium complexes have also been implicated (Diao et al. 2017; Damm et al. 2019). Therefore, understanding the taxonomy, diversity, pathogenicity, and distribution of Colletotrichum species affecting chili is essential.', 0.6368824243545532]]\nContext 5: [['The parasitic activity of the pathogen begins by infecting young fruit at the \u201cpin head\u201d stage, approximately 4 to 6 weeks post-flowering. The first symptoms are typically detected on fruits that are 8 to 10 weeks old, appearing as dark, sunken lesions that can expand and coalesce, potentially affecting the entire fruit. Some infected berries may remain attached to the branches, serving as a secondary source of inoculum. Several cycles of pathogen development can occur up to the 25th week of fruit development, when the berries develop ontogenic resistance, coinciding with the onset of fruit endocarp hardening. The severity of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) is highly dependent on climatic factors, particularly temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Rain is essential for the dispersal of conidia of Colletotrichum spp. Optimal temperatures for conidium germination and mycelial growth of C. kahawae on coffee are between 20 to 22\u00b0C. Appressorium formation occurs at these temperatures with relative humidity approaching 100%. Climatic conditions conducive to C. kahawae typically occur at high elevations (above 1,600 m), while disease incidence is minimal below 1,000 m. Agricultural practices may also influence disease severity. Currently, CBD is managed through host resistance, cultural practices, and chemical control. However, these management strategies could be implemented more efficiently as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy, which producers of Arabica coffee could adopt.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.', 0.9469877481460571]]\nContext 1: [['Diao, Y.Z., Zhang, C., Xu, J.P., et al.

Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised.

Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production.

This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2-3 days at 25\u00b0C to 6-17 days at 5\u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C, the latent period for C. acutatum was shorter than that for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species were similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may significantly contribute to inoculum sources for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may help maintain inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness durations than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves exposed to flower extracts than those exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), indicating that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may rise during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally decreased with increased plant density, concluding that higher density reduces rain penetration into the canopy and thus splash dispersal. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied splash dispersal of conidia from three Colletotrichum spp. and discovered that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while C. acutatum conidia traveled the farthest, likely due to a higher spore production on infected fruit. Colletotrichum acutatum conidia can survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but both conidia and sclerotia die quickly in moist conditions when soil moisture exceeds 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).', 0.45125091075897217]]\nContext 8: [['Madden, L.V., Wilson, L.L., Ellis, M.A. 1993.

A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.', 0.989630401134491]]\nContext 2: [['Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.', 0.9859746098518372]]\nContext 3: [['Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).', 0.9800726175308228]]\nContext 4: [['Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 \u00d7 2.3 \u2013 4.9 \u00d7 0.7 \u03bcm versus 14.2 \u00d7 1.1 \u2013 4.1 \u00d7 0.34 \u03bcm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 \u00d7 2.5 \u2013 5.5 \u00d7 1.0 \u03bcm versus 7.5 \u00d7 1.0 \u03bcm).', 0.9509915709495544]]\nContext 5: [['Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum can be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories (Cai et al. 2011).

Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). Additionally, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex.

Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.', 0.9212689399719238]]\nContext 7: [['Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot.

Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al.

Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997).', 0.8857102394104004]]\nContext 6: [['The influence of various mineral nutrients on Fusarium crown and root rot was evaluated in a non-circulating hydroponics system.

Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al.

Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).', 0.9964542388916016]]\nContext 1: [['Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010).

Consequently, all available morphological characteristics are often combined and used for systematic species discrimination.', 0.9925737380981445]]\nContext 3: [['Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.', 0.9906206130981445]]\nContext 4: [['Differentiation of C. acutatum from Other Species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species.

In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.7436787486076355]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990).

Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).', 0.5455333590507507]]\nContext 4: [['Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan.

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.44319817423820496]]\nContext 6: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.', 0.9465011954307556]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, particularly in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts (Sutton 1992).

Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.', 0.8195562958717346]]\nContext 1: [['Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally.

Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9).

A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a).

These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9464709758758545]]\nContext 5: [['Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide.

Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.', 0.9370923638343811]]\nContext 7: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.8796802759170532]]\nContext 8: [['Pathogenicity Test: Each isolated pathogen was prepared at a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10^5 conidia/mL, and 1 mL was sprayed per plant on the Seolhyang cultivar of strawberry plants. Six plants per isolate were used for testing. The inoculated plants were incubated in a dew chamber at 27\u00b0C and 100% relative humidity (RH) for 2 days before being moved to a plastic house maintained between 24\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C. After 60 days, the disease index of each plant was rated on a scale of 0 to 4: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% of petioles affected; 2, > 50% of petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on the entire plant (Nam et al., 2006). The disease index data from isolates were analyzed for means and standard error using the Costat program (CoHort Software, Berkeley, CA). All isolates caused anthracnose symptoms on the Seolhyang strawberry cultivar. The disease index for the isolates was highest (DI > 3) for CGF071204, CGF100713, and CGF110101. Smith and Black (1990) showed that the pathogenicity of C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae can be differentiated by factors such as strawberry tissue and cultivars. C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were reported to have a wide host range, while C. fragariae was restricted to strawberry plants (Freeman et al., 1998; Hyde et al., 2009b). Colletotrichum isolated from strawberries in Korea and Japan was pathogenic to both strawberry and apple fruit (Nam et al., 1998), as well as to avocado, broad bean, common sowthistle, cyclamen, pea, and strawberry under non-wound inoculation conditions (Okayama and Tsujimoto, 1994).', 0.8714684247970581]]\nContext 9: [['To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.', 0.8322808146476746]]\n"

However, perithecia rarely occur in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main type of inoculum in disease development. The model, therefore, focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, with asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli being regarded as the only inoculum responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics. Excluding a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein, 1963), potentially delaying epidemic growth (Schein, 1963), especially during rainless periods.

Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...', 0.7206128835678101]]\n"

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'.

The anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops is summarized in Figure 1. Infection often occurs in the fields during the flowering and fruiting stages. Various factors, including humidity, temperature, fruit condition, and inoculum concentration, can influence Colletotrichum infection.', 0.7809385657310486]]\nContext 1: [['The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).', 0.561258852481842]]\nContext 2: [['Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease.

Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields.

Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized.

In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986).

Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8149856925010681]]\nContext 6: [['Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).', 0.8092789649963379]]\nContext 7: [['Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii.

Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.26328012347221375]]\nContext 2: [['Cai, L., et al.

Scientifically and economically, Colletotrichum is considered the eighth most significant group of phytopathogenic fungi, capable of attacking over 3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants (Dean et al. 2012; Manire et al. 2002; O'Connell et al. 2012), including numerous crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2010; Honger et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2016). Several species of Colletotrichum have been isolated from Juglans regia, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato in Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa (Chen 2003; Cho and Shin 2004; Crous et al. 2000; Gadgil et al. 2005; Gorter 1977; Kobayashi 2007; Pennycook 1989); Colletotrichum sp. in Mexico (Alvarez 1976); C. gloeosporioides from walnut fruits in Slovenia, which caused spots on green walnut fruits (Juha\u0161ov\u00e1 et al. 2005); Colletotrichum godetiae in Australia (Damm et al. 2012); Colletotrichum acutatum in Australia (Simmonds 1966); and C. acutatum sensu lato (s.l.; geographic origin and pathogenicity unknown) (Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas 2005). In France, Colletotrichum fioriniae, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides s.l. were isolated from walnut leaves, nuts, and buds, and confirmed as pathogens of walnut anthracnose through multigene phylogenetic analysis (Da Lio et al. 2018). In Brazil, C. nymphaeae caused walnut anthracnose (Savian et al. 2019).

The pathogens responsible for walnut anthracnose include not only C. gloeosporioides but also C. fructicola and C. siamense (Wang et al. 2017, 2018) in China. C. fioriniae can infect walnut leaves, exhibiting symptoms similar to anthracnose (Zhu et al. 2015).

A single dominant gene (Rca2) appears to be responsible for this interaction (16) and distinguishes two groups of C. acutatum: those producing a non-compatible reaction with cultivars having Rca2 (group 2) and those having an intermediate degree of compatibility with cultivars possessing the Rca2 gene (group 1) (15). Although C. acutatum is more distantly related to C. gloeosporioides than to C. fragariae (35) and produces different disease symptoms on strawberry (27), there is evidence that resistance to C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and G. cingulata is correlated (34). Cultivars that are at least moderately resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum examined in the current study include 'Sweet Charlie' (8), 'Carmine' (10), and 'Earlibrite' (C. K. Chandler, unpublished). 'Sweet Charlie' is field immune to fruit rot, whereas 'Carmine' and 'Earlibrite' are moderately resistant. Although the mechanism of resistance to C. acutatum in these cultivars has not been examined, it is likely that they possess at least one copy of a dominant resistance gene against group 2 C. acutatum isolates. A dominant resistance gene to this group of isolates was found in 13 of 14 cultivars from the United States and Europe classified as intermediately susceptible or resistant to anthracnose fruit rot, whereas it occurred in only one of seven cultivars classified as susceptible (16). Additionally, cultivars such as 'Dover', which is homozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), and 'Sequoia', which is heterozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), are present in the pedigrees of the three fruit rot-resistant cultivars used in the current study (9\u201311). With the exception of 'Treasure', no cultivar displayed significantly greater resistance to crown rot than 'Sweet Charlie', 'Earlibrite', and 'Carmine', suggesting that major gene resistance to C. acutatum could also be effective against C. gloeosporioides. The lack of a cultivar-by-isolate interaction observed with isolates of C. gloeosporioides could be due to little variation in a gene product or products in this species that are homologous to those responsible for the interaction with C. acutatum. Also important is the fact that 'Treasure' was found to be highly susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum in field trials conducted over two years (C. K. Chandler, unpublished), indicating that genes responsible for resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides do not necessarily confer resistance to C. acutatum.\", 0.6570264101028442]]\nContext 4: [['Peres, N.

Based on our pathogenicity data, all of them can potentially infect peach and guava, except for the C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava at all. There is no difference in virulence among the three species tested on apple. Colletotrichum nymphaeae was recently identified among strains in the NIAS Genbank from multiple hosts, including several strains from apple and peach in Japan (Sato & Moriwaki, 2013). This species caused lesions on fruits of all three hosts tested and apparently also occurs on all of them in nature. Although C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae have a large host range with some overlapping hosts, there could still be differences in pathogenicity and aggressiveness.', 0.9928117394447327]]\nContext 2: [['All strains tested formed large lesions on all inoculated peach fruits; however, their infection frequency and lesion size on guava and apple varied.

C. abscissum showed no difference in lesion size between peach and guava. This strain infected only one apple, and the lesion size was smaller than those caused by most other strains tested. Colletotrichum melonis strain Col 20 infected all inoculated guava fruits, while C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730 infected only peach and apple.

This strain was collected from guava fruit with anthracnose in a commercial orchard in Cafel\u00e2ndia. Previous studies revealed its pathogenicity to citrus, causing postbloom fruit drop in 70% of inoculated flowers (Ramiro et al., unpublished data). Guava volatiles repel Diaphorina citri, the vector of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), making guava intercropping a strategy to control HLB (Beattie et al., 2006). However, the ability of guava to host C. abscissum has significant epidemiological implications for citrus postbloom fruit drop outbreaks. All strains tested for pathogenicity on fruits were able to infect various hosts, though they varied in aggressiveness. Studies have shown a lack of host specificity among Colletotrichum species infecting fruits (Peres et al. 2002; MacKenzie et al. 2009; Lakshmi et al. 2011; Phoulivong et al. 2012; de Souza et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2013; Baroncelli et al. 2015). Many Colletotrichum species associate with different hosts, and one host can be affected by multiple species (Damm et al. 2012, 2014; Weir et al. 2012). In a study by MacKenzie et al. (2009), genetically distinct strains of C. acutatum (s. lat.) from strawberry, blueberry, citrus, and fern exhibited pathogenicity and varied in aggressiveness, with the highest incidence and largest lesions on their original host.

The table provides a comparative analysis of lesion sizes across these different fruits, showcasing the varying susceptibility to the pathogen. The specific measurements for lesion development on each type of fruit highlight the differences in response to the inoculation, potentially reflecting the host-specific interactions and the aggressiveness of the fungal isolates used.', 0.8952956795692444]]\nContext 5: [['The filamentous fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph = Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H.

The disease can develop on stems, twigs, leaves, and fruit of host plants. On peach, the pathogen often occurs in areas and during seasons with high rainfall and warm temperatures (Ogawa et al. 1995). Symptoms include sunken lesions with circular rings, where conidia of the fungus are produced in acervuli. Anthracnose disease can occasionally cause yield loss in commercial peach orchards in the southeastern United States, especially during wet and warm summers.', 0.8909239172935486]]\nContext 6: [['Many inoculation studies have been conducted with Colletotrichum spp., demonstrating that most isolates are relatively non-host-specific. However, relatively few studies have addressed the host specificity of C. acutatum. Bernstein et al. inoculated non-wounded, detached ripe peach fruit with isolates of Colletotrichum spp. from various hosts and found that lesion size was not related to the source of the isolate. Freeman and Shabi inoculated detached nectarine, mango, avocado, almond, and apple fruit with conidial suspensions of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach. All isolates produced lesions on the fruit, but it was necessary to wound the mango fruit to obtain infection. Peres et al. found that a C. acutatum isolate from strawberry produced lesions on wounded, detached fruit of avocado, guava, papaya, mango, and passion fruit, but not on banana. Isolates from strawberry also produced lesions on both wounded and non-wounded fruit of pear, peach, nectarine, and apple. Thus, it appears that C. acutatum has a broad host range, at least among fruit crops, and is relatively nonspecific. However, many of the above studies were conducted in the laboratory using detached and wounded fruit. The movement of C. acutatum from one fruit crop to another under natural conditions has not been demonstrated, and molecular groups often seem to be host-specific.', 0.8903955817222595]]\nContext 7: [['In terms of virulence, anthracnose symptoms can vary among different fruits based on factors such as the variety of the fruit, inoculum concentration, humidity, and temperature.

The diverse species of Colletotrichum that cause anthracnose in fruit crops also pose quarantine concerns. Fruits such as banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado are exported and imported worldwide, and latent infections are a key part of the disease cycle for anthracnose pathogens.

Although C. karstii showed the lowest aggressiveness, it still demonstrated the ability to cause lesions, as did other species, including C. catinaense, C. helleniense, C. hystricis, C. limonicola, and C. novae-zelandiae. The clone \u2018Tarocco Scir\u00e8\u2019 was more susceptible than \u2018Tarocco Nucellare\u2019, aligning with findings from Aiello et al.

These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.', 0.5991893410682678]]\n"

The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.', 0.9485364556312561]]\nContext 1: [['The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).', 0.91252601146698]]\nContext 2: [['The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field.

This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum.

The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.\", 0.9933086633682251]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).', 0.9930295348167419]]\nContext 2: [['Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).', 0.9909023642539978]]\nContext 3: [['Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a serious disease affecting strawberries.

In this study, multilocus phylogenetic analysis (utilizing genes such as actin, \u03b2-tubulin, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) revealed that 100 isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of strawberry in central China belong to five species. Specifically, 97 isolates were identified as belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, with the distribution as follows: C. murrayae (81%), C. gloeosporioides (8%), C. fructicola (4%), and C. aenigma (4%).

The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.', 0.99334716796875]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.', 0.9931843876838684]]\nContext 2: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.9886566996574402]]\nContext 3: [[\"Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.\", 0.9854596257209778]]\nContext 4: [['Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).', 0.9604505896568298]]\nContext 5: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.9455569982528687]]\nContext 6: [['Since Colletotrichum spp. may infect many other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields is sometimes assumed to come from these other hosts growing near the strawberry field.

However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.', 0.8911870121955872]]\nContext 8: [['Our evidence suggests that Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum can survive and multiply on symptomless strawberry leaves, and that the production of secondary conidia may increase inoculum when susceptible tissue is not available.

The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.2860662043094635]]\nContext 6: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose.

While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions.

The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin.

Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.42509526014328003]]\nContext 2: [['Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop.

(2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000).

It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex.

However, C. hippeastri differs in several other characteristics. The conidia of C. hippeastri are typically narrower at each end or in the center, unlike those of C. dracaenophilum and C. nupharicola, which do not exhibit narrowing (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006). Germinating conidia of C. hippeastri can form 2-4 cells (Fig. 4), a feature that distinguishes it from other Colletotrichum species. The conidia of C. nupharicola become 2-celled, and secondary conidia form from germ tubes (Johnson et al., 1997). The appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. nupharicola (10.5-17.5 \u00d7 8-12.5 \u00b5m vs. 6-10 \u00d7 7-9 \u00b5m) and are irregular, crenate, or lobed (Figs. 4H, I, K-N), whereas those of C. nupharicola are ovoid to clavate.

C. sansevieriae is also highly host-specific to Sansevieria (Nakamura et al., 2006).

In contrast, relatively distantly related members of the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes exhibit remarkably similar repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secreted proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016).

The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.', 0.9901958107948303]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9883072972297668]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010).

This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014).

(2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.\", 0.5555667281150818]]\nContext 3: [[\"The genus Colletotrichum Corda is one of the most important and destructive plant pathogens globally. Scientifically and economically, Colletotrichum is considered the eighth most significant group of phytopathogenic fungi, capable of attacking over 3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants (Dean et al. 2012; Manire et al. 2002; O'Connell et al. 2012), including numerous crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2010; Honger et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2016). Several species of Colletotrichum have been isolated from Juglans regia, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato in Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa (Chen 2003; Cho and Shin 2004; Crous et al. 2000; Gadgil et al. 2005; Gorter 1977; Kobayashi 2007; Pennycook 1989); Colletotrichum sp. in Mexico (Alvarez 1976); C. gloeosporioides from walnut fruits in Slovenia, which caused spots on green walnut fruits (Juha\u0161ov\u00e1 et al. 2005); Colletotrichum godetiae in Australia (Damm et al. 2012); Colletotrichum acutatum in Australia (Simmonds 1966); and C. acutatum sensu lato (s.l.; geographic origin and pathogenicity unknown) (Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas 2005). In France, Colletotrichum fioriniae, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides s.l. were isolated from walnut leaves, nuts, and buds, and confirmed as pathogens of walnut anthracnose through multigene phylogenetic analysis (Da Lio et al. 2018). In Brazil, C. nymphaeae caused walnut anthracnose (Savian et al. 2019). In China, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (Chen 2003; Qu et al. 2011), C. acutatum (Liu et al. 1995), C. fioriniae (Zhu et al. 2015), Colletotrichum siamense (Wang et al. 2017), Colletotrichum fructicola (Wang et al. 2018), and Colletotrichum viniferum (He et al. 2019) were isolated from walnut. The pathogens responsible for walnut anthracnose include not only C. gloeosporioides but also C. fructicola and C. siamense (Wang et al. 2017, 2018) in China. C. fioriniae can infect walnut leaves, exhibiting symptoms similar to anthracnose (Zhu et al. 2015). C. viniferum specifically infected walnut leaves, though the symptoms were not typical (He et al. 2019).\", 0.35204043984413147]]\nContext 4: [['Killgore, E.M., Sugiyama, L.S., Barreto, R.W., Gardner, D.E.

The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.', 0.9981390237808228]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.', 0.9723177552223206]]\nContext 2: [['Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.', 0.9665833711624146]]\nContext 3: [['The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.', 0.9615749716758728]]\nContext 4: [['Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).', 0.85847008228302]]\nContext 5: [['This Perspective article presents a review of the current knowledge on C. acutatum phylogeny, biology, and pathology.

The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010).

(2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011).

In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.', 0.9634588360786438]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide.

Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.8531960248947144]]\nContext 5: [['During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf.

Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose.

Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.903980016708374]]\nContext 3: [['Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.7941548228263855]]\nContext 4: [['Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide.

The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus.

Penetration through stomata or wounds by germ tubes without appressoria formation is rare (Zulqarnain et al., 1996). Infection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after a symptomless biotrophic phase, leading to a necrotic phase in which host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow both intra- and inter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogen has a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), with the switch to the necrotrophic phase occurring only when host tissue and environmental conditions favor the continuation of the infection cycle.

With citrus postbloom fruit drop, the infection strategy on leaves is presumably biotrophic. After the end of the bloom period, conidia germinate to form appressoria, establishing quiescent infections that are likely intracellular (6, 92). The tissues where quiescent infections develop are never colonized, and necrotrophy does not occur on leaves; rather, conidia and secondary conidia are produced following the germination of the appressorium on the surface. However, on flower petals, the pathogen behaves as a necrotroph. For key lime and strawberries, the biotrophic phase is very short. The pathogen produces appressoria, penetrates the host, and forms a subcuticular intramural necrotrophic association almost immediately (16). Curry et al. (16) regarded this strategy as a modification of necrotrophy rather than bio- or hemibiotrophy due to the brief biotrophic phase.', 0.5399327278137207]]\nContext 9: [['The absence of a significant plant resistance response ensures successful colonization of host tissue and subsequent necrotrophic activities.

The early stages of invasion for both strategies include conidial adhesion to the host surface, germination of conidia, production of germ tubes, and penetration of the host cuticle via appressoria. Subcuticular intramural pathogens grow within the cuticle and the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells, killing host cells prior to entering them (necrotrophic phase). In contrast, intracellular hemibiotrophic pathogens invade living cells for a short time, maintaining them apparently for nutritional advantage, before converting to a necrotrophic phase.', 0.5139548182487488]]\n"

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.9480653405189514]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.9385277628898621]]\nContext 2: [['Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan.

Among the combined hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense, the top four orders are Fabales, Sapindales, Rosales, and Asparagales, each containing 12, 12, 11, and 11 genera, respectively.', 0.9977613687515259]]\nContext 1: [['A significant effort has been dedicated to identifying which species of Colletotrichum are involved in various anthracnose-type diseases of plants and developing tools for their identification and differentiation.

Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.\", 0.22107672691345215]]\nContext 9: [['Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.21566282212734222]]\n"

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['In recent years, genome sequences for 28 species of Colletotrichum have been published, and comparative genomic studies have concentrated on genes associated with pathogenicity (Gan et al., 2013), host specialization (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016), and transitions between biotrophic and necrotrophic lifestyles (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012), as well as between endophytic and parasitic lifestyles (Hacquard et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016). Comparative analyses of secretomes have revealed that most predicted secreted proteins possess enzymatic activity, with many identified as candidate effectors (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016; Sanz-Mart\u00edn et al., 2016). The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012).', 0.9896005988121033]]\nContext 1: [['The shift towards multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has significantly changed the classification and species concepts within the Colletotrichum genus (Cannon et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013, 2014, Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective.

For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.', 0.5852934122085571]]\nContext 2: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5349346399307251]]\nContext 3: [['Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies.

No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).', 0.8868314623832703]]\nContext 3: [[\"Supplementary Figure S1 provides a visual representation of anthracnose symptoms on strawberry plants, depicting various stages and characteristics of infection.

Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.9925334453582764]]\nContext 1: [['Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries.

Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9).

This is succeeded by inter- and intracellular colonization and the death of the tissue. The mechanism for the shift from biotrophy to necrotrophy is uncertain; however, C. acutatum, along with other species of Colletotrichum, produces ammonia that causes local pH increases during the transition to necrotrophy (70).

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae.

Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013).

Most of these strains were identified as C. fioriniae, with some classified as C. clavatum (a synonym of C. godetiae) based on ITS sequences (Ivic et al. 2012). The first report of apple bitter rot in the United Kingdom was also linked to C. godetiae (Baroncelli et al. 2014). One strain shared the same ITS sequence as strains BBA 65797 and IMI 345581, the latter of which had previously been identified as C. salicis by Damm et al. (2012). However, it is important to note that related species may exhibit identical ITS sequences, as this locus is not always informative at the species level within the C. acutatum species complex. Other strains from apples in Europe included in the study by Damm et al. (2012) were also identified as C. fioriniae and C. godetiae. In contrast, strains from apples in Japan, identified by Sato and Moriwaki (2013) through a multilocus analysis, were found to belong to C. nymphaeae and C. godetiae. Similarly, strains from bitter rot of apple in Korea, as studied by Lee et al. (2007), likely belong to C. fioriniae and a species within the C. acutatum clade 2 (which includes C. nymphaeae and related species) according to Damm et al. (2012). Previously isolated strains from apples and other fruits in Brazil that belong to the C. acutatum species complex were identified only as C. acutatum s. lat. (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2006; Giaretta et al. 2010). If sequences of these strains were generated at all, only ITS sequences are available on GenBank, which do not permit accurate species identification within this complex. As a result, the name C. acutatum is still used broadly in Brazil (Serra et al. 2011; De Souza et al. 2013; Barquero Quir\u00f3s et al. 2013; Ciampi-Guillardi et al. 2014).

In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b).

In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011).

Given the global importance of this genus, primarily consisting of plant pathogens, it is critical to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to enhance biosecurity and disease control efforts. Traditional methods of species identification have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues.

It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognized here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii, and 12 previously undescribed species: C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae, and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are known only from New Zealand, possibly reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was established, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and renamed as C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening, which may extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, and conidia featuring a prominent basal scar.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures.

Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

The fungus can survive as dried conidia in acervuli or as mycelia in dead tissues, including spurs and mummified almond fruit.', 0.6825817823410034]]\nContext 1: [['The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.6380686163902283]]\nContext 2: [['Our model is general in that it has one conceptual structure that incorporates the key epidemiological components of anthracnose diseases. Although Colletotrichum spp. exhibit various lifestyles categorized as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic\u2014with hemibiotrophic being the most common (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017)\u2014all species have a necrotrophic stage (Prusky et al., 2013), except for a few species that live entirely as endophytes (e.g., some species in the gloeosporioides clade on Salacia and Camellia; Bhagya et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). The timing of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on the host, its growth stage, environmental conditions (Wharton et al., 2001; Peres et al., 2005), and the phylogenetic clade (De Silva et al., 2017). For instance, the graminicola and destructivum clades have a short biotrophic period, while the acutatum and gloeosporioides clades exhibit a quiescent lifestyle on certain fruit trees like almond and guava (De Silva et al., 2017). Our model accounts for the common attributes of Colletotrichum lifestyles in terms of: (i) a reproductive (asexual) stage, which occurs on the host plant or in plant debris; (ii) infection caused by conidia; (iii) an asymptomatic (biotrophic) stage that can be either short or extended, depending on the incubation period; (iv) a necrotrophic stage in which host cells are invaded and killed, leading to the appearance of symptoms (lesions in our model); and (v) a sporulation stage, i.e., the production of secondary inoculum on lesions.', 0.5657044053077698]]\nContext 3: [['O\u2019Connell, R.

Comparative analyses of secretomes have revealed that most predicted secreted proteins possess enzymatic activity, with many identified as candidate effectors (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016; Sanz-Mart\u00edn et al., 2016). The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012).', 0.4993348717689514]]\nContext 5: [['Prusky et al.

In this instance, colonization is biotrophic following fungal penetration but shifts to necrotrophy during intercellular growth. This is succeeded by inter- and intracellular colonization and the death of the tissue. The mechanism for the shift from biotrophy to necrotrophy is uncertain; however, C. acutatum, along with other species of Colletotrichum, produces ammonia that causes local pH increases during the transition to necrotrophy (70). In most host-pathogen interactions, the specific cellular-level interactions remain unknown and may represent a combination of strategies, as shown in the preceding descriptions.', 0.26005828380584717]]\nContext 7: [['Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).', 0.19085539877414703]]\nContext 8: [['Another significant finding from comparative studies is that lifestyle and host preference do not correlate with phylogenetic relationships (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). A comparison of the genomes of the endophyte C. tofieldiae and the closely related pathogen C. incanum indicated that the transition to an endophytic lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the number of predicted effectors and an expansion of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related proteins (Hacquard et al., 2016). In contrast, relatively distantly related members of the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes exhibit remarkably similar repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secreted proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). This observation suggests that these gene families evolved recently and independently in these two phylogenetically separated lineages (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). Further comparative analyses of the genomes within the C. acutatum species complex revealed that necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins were twice as abundant as in the other fungi studied.

In many cases, the same species have been recorded with several lifestyles; however, due to the ambiguity of species identification, it is not always clear whether they are definitively the same species.

Conidia were recovered from all plants over a 2- to 3-month period, regardless of whether overhead or drip irrigation was used (see Fig. 2). The number of conidia recovered from strawberry was comparable to that from the other plants at all time points and, in most cases, the differences were not significant (P < 0.05) across the different plant species, although disease symptoms were observed only on the strawberry plants. Significant numbers of conidia were still recovered from the plants at the end of the experiment, indicating that the survival potential of the fungus on all plant species exceeded 3 months.', 0.9918012022972107]]\nContext 1: [['In Israel, inoculation of isolates of C. acutatum from anemone and strawberry into each host resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms on both plant species. Molecular studies indicated that the isolates from the two hosts were similar and formed a single genetic subgroup. Isolates of C. acutatum were recovered from pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, as well as from weeds of the genera Vicia and Conyza; however, disease symptoms occurred only on strawberry. C. acutatum isolates from tulip tree in Argentina were also pathogenic to strawberry fruit. Thus, strawberry isolates of C. acutatum can parasitize and cause disease on other hosts or, alternatively, survive on other crops and weeds without producing symptoms.', 0.984767496585846]]\nContext 2: [['The fungus was shown to survive on asymptomatic leaves of several plant species under greenhouse conditions (12). Studies suggested that symptomless foliage might play an important role in the anthracnose disease cycle, acting both as a refuge for fungal survival and as a source of inoculum for fruit and flower infections (12, 19, 33). Temperature and wetness have been reported to affect mycelial growth (1, 7, 11, 21, 37, 39), as well as the germination and sporulation of C. acutatum on agar (11), and its infection and sporulation on fruit (18, 39). However, similar studies on strawberry foliage have not been conducted. Additionally, the production of secondary conidia was not addressed in earlier research.', 0.9659210443496704]]\nContext 3: [['In strawberries, C. acutatum is typically introduced into production fields from nurseries. While some plants may exhibit symptoms, often the pathogen is introduced through asymptomatic leaves or petioles, likely as appressoria or quiescent infections. It remains unclear whether quiescent infections develop into lesions or if appressoria germinate to produce conidia. However, conidia of C. acutatum can generate several secondary conidia from each deposited conidium on the leaf surface. This suggests that the fungus is reproducing by utilizing nutrients on the leaf surface rather than relying on reserves from the original conidium. In these instances, it appears that the fungus is growing as an epiphyte rather than producing quiescent infections.', 0.9522066116333008]]\nContext 4: [['In inoculations conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions, C. acutatum from strawberry was isolated from inoculated plants that did not exhibit disease symptoms but maintained virulence on strawberry. The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods. Furthermore, it has been shown that C. acutatum from strawberry can survive for nine months within plant debris in soil.', 0.9341785907745361]]\nContext 5: [['The epiphytic behavior of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may play a critical role in the strawberry anthracnose disease cycle. Recent studies have shown that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on strawberry leaves without visible symptom development and can persist on symptomless foliage of strawberries and weeds for several weeks. As a result, symptomless leaves may act as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose. Similarly, symptomless foliage of tomato and citrus has been reported to provide inoculum for diseases caused by C. coccodes and C. acutatum, respectively.', 0.9248916506767273]]\nContext 6: [['This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.', 0.8669175505638123]]\nContext 7: [['Symptomless foliage harbors inoculum for fruit and flower infections by several Colletotrichum species (7, 21, 28). Pantidou and Schroeder (21) demonstrated that conidia of C. phomoides harvested from symptomless tomato leaves could cause infections on tomato fruit. In citrus, C. acutatum survives on leaves as quiescent appressoria (28, 30), which can be stimulated to germinate and produce secondary conidia, serving as inoculum for flower infections. It has also been suggested that quiescent infections on strawberry leaves may provide inoculum for strawberry anthracnose epidemics (23). However, the potential for inoculum production on symptomless strawberry leaves has not been investigated.

Greater awareness of the surreptitious fungal dynamics on symptomless plants may also justify changes in currently recommended control strategies. For instance, early fungicide applications might effectively reduce initial inoculum production on developing plants, thereby decreasing subsequent epidemic development on fruit.', 0.7614240050315857]]\n"

Anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments.

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973).

With spores as small and indistinct as those of Colletotrichum, even minor differences, while valid, are often difficult to demonstrate. Due to individual variability, overlapping between species is inevitable. As noted by Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949), extreme values are of limited use when comparing spore measurements of Colletotrichum species unless accompanied by the mean, as the range is typically too broad to effectively delimit species. This is why many older descriptions are challenging to interpret.', 0.9848642945289612]]\nContext 1: [['Since the perfect stage of this variety is encountered only rarely in Queensland, it is practical to have a distinguishing name for the conidial state as well. Wollenweber and Hochapfel consider the imperfect state of their G. cingulata var. minor to be Gloeosporium elasticae (Thlim.) Cke. & Mass., listing several synonyms, mainly species occurring on fig and coffee. The conidial measurements provided by Wollenweber and Hochapfel for this species fall within the range obtained for C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland. Given the accepted synonymy of Gloeosporium with Colletotrichum, it would be unwise to continue using the former generic name. Unfortunately, Colletotrichum elasticae is already occupied by C. elasticae Tassi. Aside from the fact that a species name is not readily available, it seems preferable to designate the conidial state of a variety of G. cingulata as a variety of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Therefore, the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. var. minor var. nov. is proposed and is used in this article.

Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola clades (De Silva et al., 2017). However, perithecia rarely occur in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main type of inoculum in disease development. The model, therefore, focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, with asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli being regarded as the only inoculum responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics. Excluding a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein, 1963), potentially delaying epidemic growth (Schein, 1963), especially during rainless periods. This is because ascospores can be forcibly discharged from perithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity (Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).', 0.16908150911331177]]\n"

Past studies have shown that (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot and increased yield in strawberry (6) and suppressed root diseases in other crops (5, 10, 11). Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 did not impact the recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. from roots but did increase root weight and the number of lesion nematodes. Since P. penetrans is an obligate parasite that must live in living roots, it is reasonable to find lower densities of this pathogen on roots of dead and declining strawberries, as evidenced in the Ca(NO3)2-treated plants, compared to healthier plants treated with (NH4)2SO4.', 0.7818560600280762]]\nContext 1: [['In February 1999, it was reported that rotating with oats and fertilizing with NH4-N can suppress take-all disease in wheat. Our findings support the hypothesis that combining oat rotation with NH4-N fertilization can reduce root diseases in plants. Both oat cultivars suppressed black root rot under the (NH4)2SO4 regime but differed in their effects on the two main pathogens. Saia oats reduced the number of root lesion nematodes but did not affect root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. In contrast, Garry oats reduced root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. but did not affect the numbers of lesion nematodes. Furthermore, the Saia oat pre-crop increased early berry yield, whereas Garry oats had no significant effect. The yield increase following rotation with Saia oats may have been due to its unsuitability as a host for the lesion nematode, which, in these soils, may have been a more yield-reducing pathogen. In other experiments, we found that Saia oats were similar to Garry oats in reducing R. fragariae recovery from soil (14; J. A. LaMondia, unpublished research). Therefore, the failure of Garry oats to affect yield may be attributed to its high susceptibility to the lesion nematode. The resistance of Saia oats to the lesion nematode was first recognized by Colbran (3), who noted its utility in suppressing re-plant problems in apple orchards. Townsend (24) later demonstrated that Saia oats were resistant to Pratylenchus neglectus Rensch and P. penetrans. However, the resistance to the lesion nematode does not entirely explain the effects of Saia oats on disease and yield, as sorgho-sudangrass also reduced lesion nematodes but had no significant impact on disease severity or yield. The reduction in nematode densities by sorgho-sudangrass may have been insufficient to affect yield. Additionally, it is possible that oat straw residues have specific effects on the disease. Papavizas (18) reported that oat (presumably A. sativa) straw residues increased the number of antagonistic bacteria to R. solani and other fungal pathogens in soil. Since we did not examine antagonism, it is unclear whether the residues of Avena spp. act differently toward soil microbes compared to those of sorgho-sudangrass.', 0.7101511359214783]]\nContext 2: [['Abstract: This study evaluates how host nutritional variables affect the severity of crown and root rot in tomatoes caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici. Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.', 0.18738321959972382]]\nContext 3: [['Compared to Ca(NO3)2, the (NH4)2SO4 treatment reduced the percentage of blackened roots.

Furthermore, the combination of \u2018Saia\u2019 or \u2018Garry\u2019 oats as a precrop with applications of (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot severity relative to controls.

Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997).', 0.07593643665313721]]\n"

Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates.

During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae.

Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.', 0.4601827561855316]]\nContext 5: [['Some host plants appear to be particularly susceptible to infection by multiple Colletotrichum taxa. The occurrence of species on strawberry has been well researched due to the former status of C. acutatum as a regulated quarantine pathogen. We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae).

A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness.

The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable.

Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b).

Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1\u03b1) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications.

In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable.

However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.', 0.9968155026435852]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9956489205360413]]\nContext 2: [['Rain splash is the primary means by which conidia of Colletotrichum spp. spread from plant to plant in the field.

Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus.

It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits.

Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37).

This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.', 0.9762616157531738]]\nContext 6: [['Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).', 0.9614489078521729]]\nContext 7: [['Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).', 0.8369107246398926]]\nContext 8: [['Results from several studies suggest that Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. In one of these studies (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence of two subgroups within C. acutatum. The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberries and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses. Based on these molecular data, Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberries. Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).', 0.8219635486602783]]\nContext 9: [['The perceived lack of host specificity in the C. acutatum complex likely has multiple causes, but a significant issue stems from inadequate identification practices in pathology studies.

This often results in excessive or insufficient watering. Hydroponic technology that considers drainage rates can minimize drainage amounts, thereby reducing environmental pollution and fertilizer consumption. This study compared drainage rates and timed watering methods in a strawberry hydroponic system to determine the optimal drainage rate. As the drainage rate increased, the amount of water supplied also increased. A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. The drainage electrical conductivity (EC) level was highest in the 10% drainage rate group. In the 20% drainage rate treatment, leaf length and width increased compared to the four applications of the timer-supplying method. The yield of fruits weighing more than 27 g was highest in the 20% drainage rate treatment, indicating it was the most appropriate. We propose that it is possible to reduce unnecessary fertilizer consumption and increase productivity by managing water supply through drainage rates for precise water supply management in strawberries.', 0.9399930834770203]]\nContext 1: [['This study was conducted to determine an appropriate watering method by comparing the irrigation characteristics of the timed and drainage rate watering control methods, which are commonly used in hydroponic strawberry cultivation.

The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.', 0.9846773147583008]]\nContext 2: [['In a study conducted in Zhejiang province, China, the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates was assessed on wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves.

For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference.

(2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010).

The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011).

Hence, there was no disadvantage to the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants having reduced expression of cutinase once they had infected the pericarp tissue. These results were consistent with previously reported work demonstrating that the C. capsici pathotype F8-3B was able to infect chili fruits when wound inoculation was applied. If the hypothesis is that cutinase assists with the penetration of the fungal pathogen, then the wound inoculation method is unlikely to demonstrate the function of the gene since the host's first layer of defense (cuticle and epidermis) has been disrupted.\", 0.9979606866836548]]\nContext 1: [['The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.', 0.9968384504318237]]\nContext 2: [['Cutinase has been proposed as the hydrolyzing agent of the plant cuticle and/or an elicitor of cutin monomers, which trigger signaling pathways within fungal pathogens.

Some pathogens utilize mechanical means through specialized infection structures, while others penetrate the cuticle directly with the assistance of extracellular cutinase activity. Colletotrichum truncatum, a pathogen of legumes, cereals, grasses, and vegetable crops such as Capsicum species, is an ascomycete that infects its host through direct penetration of the host cuticle. The infection and penetration process is believed to be triggered by cutin-degrading enzymes such as cutinase. Numerous cutinases have been isolated and characterized from different fungi. These enzymes are suggested to play roles in carbon acquisition for saprophytic growth, as well as in fungal penetration and surface adhesion.', 0.7431445121765137]]\nContext 5: [['Pathogenicity tests of Colletotrichum spp. from chili revealed that, while all species were pathogenic on chili fruits after wounding the surface, most produced a low level of infection on non-wounded fruit. This illustrates the importance of the cuticle acting as a barrier to infection by Colletotrichum spp. (Auyong et al. 2015) and emphasizes the need for informed and standardized inoculation techniques in pathogenicity assays. Some species, such as C. tropicale, C. makassarense, and C. plurivorum, which exhibited low infection levels in the assays on non-wounded fruit, may have a predominantly endophytic lifestyle and then switch to a necrotrophic lifestyle to complete their life cycle (De Silva et al. 2017b). However, further pathogenicity tests on different chili cultivars and at varying fruit maturity stages are necessary to comprehensively evaluate their pathogenicity. Pathogenicity testing of C. plurivorum on chili leaves and fruits showed that isolates collected from Chiang Rai and Malaysia could infect leaves but not fruits (results not shown), suggesting they might be specialized leaf pathogens. In contrast, two isolates of C. plurivorum from Bangkok did not infect leaves but did infect wounded fruits, demonstrating the pathogenic variation that can exist within a single species.', 0.45346957445144653]]\nContext 6: [['The reduced level of cutinase expression in the transformants may have interrupted or delayed pathogen recognition of the host surface, resulting in the formation of a lower number of appressoria. Cutinase may be required to stimulate a host reaction, which is then recognized by the pathogen to initiate appressoria formation and penetration. Therefore, the inability of the pathogen to express the effector (cutinase) may have led to poor infection rates. Deising et al. reported that cutinase was involved in the adhesion of Uromyces viciae uredospores to the host cuticle. In another report, Woloshuk and Kolattukudy indicated that the expression of cutinase from spores of Fusarium solani was triggered upon contact with the plant cuticle. Indeed, Li et al. reported that low levels of cutinase present in the saprophytic phase of F. pisi f. sp. pisi were essential to induce higher levels of cutinase expression during infection of the fungus to penetrate its host. Since the endogenous cutinase in these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants was suppressed, the regulation of normal cutinase activity was affected. Whether this abnormal regulation of cutinase activity occurred due to its inability to secrete sufficient levels of cutinase initially to induce cutin monomers from the host or from a failure of the pathogen to detect the host cutin monomers remains unknown.', 0.21734660863876343]]\nContext 7: [['Martinez, C., Nicolas, A., van Tilbeurgh, H., Egloff, M.

Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.', 0.33505791425704956]]\nContext 2: [['Suggesting additional tests or studies to identify crop production issues.', 0.20721793174743652]]\nContext 3: [['Cataldo, D.

A single dominant gene (Rca2) appears to be responsible for this interaction (16) and distinguishes two groups of C. acutatum: those producing a non-compatible reaction with cultivars having Rca2 (group 2) and those having an intermediate degree of compatibility with cultivars possessing the Rca2 gene (group 1) (15). Although C. acutatum is more distantly related to C. gloeosporioides than to C. fragariae (35) and produces different disease symptoms on strawberry (27), there is evidence that resistance to C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and G. cingulata is correlated (34). Cultivars that are at least moderately resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum examined in the current study include 'Sweet Charlie' (8), 'Carmine' (10), and 'Earlibrite' (C. K. Chandler, unpublished). 'Sweet Charlie' is field immune to fruit rot, whereas 'Carmine' and 'Earlibrite' are moderately resistant. Although the mechanism of resistance to C. acutatum in these cultivars has not been examined, it is likely that they possess at least one copy of a dominant resistance gene against group 2 C. acutatum isolates. A dominant resistance gene to this group of isolates was found in 13 of 14 cultivars from the United States and Europe classified as intermediately susceptible or resistant to anthracnose fruit rot, whereas it occurred in only one of seven cultivars classified as susceptible (16). Additionally, cultivars such as 'Dover', which is homozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), and 'Sequoia', which is heterozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), are present in the pedigrees of the three fruit rot-resistant cultivars used in the current study (9\u201311). With the exception of 'Treasure', no cultivar displayed significantly greater resistance to crown rot than 'Sweet Charlie', 'Earlibrite', and 'Carmine', suggesting that major gene resistance to C. acutatum could also be effective against C. gloeosporioides. The lack of a cultivar-by-isolate interaction observed with isolates of C. gloeosporioides could be due to little variation in a gene product or products in this species that are homologous to those responsible for the interaction with C. acutatum. Also important is the fact that 'Treasure' was found to be highly susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum in field trials conducted over two years (C. K. Chandler, unpublished), indicating that genes responsible for resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides do not necessarily confer resistance to C. acutatum.\", 0.7113246917724609]]\nContext 2: [['Sreenivasaprasad, S., & Talhinhas, P.

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini.

Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). Additionally, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex.

While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes.

(26) suggested that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberry are distinct from U.S. C. acutatum isolates found in a variety of hosts. In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California.

For instance, in countries such as France, Israel, Bulgaria, and Spain, most strawberry anthracnose pathogen isolates clustered into the same species, C. nymphaeae, with minimal intra-specific diversity observed within each country. In contrast, Belgian isolates exhibited a different composition: 33% belonged to C. nymphaeae, 5% to C. fioriniae, 50% to C. godetiae, 3% to C. acutatum sensu stricto, and 6% to C. salicis. The C. acutatum sensu lato status in the UK may stem from a recent introduction in the late 1970s from a limited number of sources.

Because isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry collected in Europe and the United States were closely related genetically, it is possible that the C. gloeosporioides isolates pathogenic on strawberry were also introduced into Europe from North America through plant trade, similar to what has been suggested for C. acutatum.

(one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al.

Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al.

Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).', 0.9581937789916992]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.', 0.9915633201599121]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).', 0.8687886595726013]]\nContext 2: [['Smith, B.J. 2007.

Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.', 0.7801898121833801]]\nContext 4: [['Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992).

Anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments.

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.5790523290634155]]\nContext 9: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5786470174789429]]\n"

In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini.

Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.', 0.3297332227230072]]\nContext 5: [['Figure 1 illustrates the anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops, drawn by Latiffah Zakaria.

The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions that contain conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions can merge to form larger lesions. These dark lesions on the fruit surface are unattractive to consumers and significantly reduce the market value of the affected fruits.

In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent.

Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial.

Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.', 0.9981927275657654]]\nContext 1: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.9981552958488464]]\nContext 2: [['Ji et al. (2022) reported that a total of 11 Colletotrichum species have been identified as pathogens of strawberries in China, which will be comprehensively introduced later. In Europe, strawberry anthracnose is largely attributed to the C. acutatum complex. Strains of C. godetiae infectious to strawberries have been documented in Ireland and Norway (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Chethana et al. 2016). In Denmark, C. nymphaeae is the only Colletotrichum species reported as a strawberry pathogen (Braganca et al. 2016), with similar reports from Bulgaria (Bobev et al. 2002; Jelev et al. 2008; Jayawardena et al. 2016b), Switzerland, and Portugal (Baroncelli et al. 2015). Both C. godetiae and C. nymphaeae were identified as strawberry pathogens in the Netherlands (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Jayawardena et al. 2016b) and Spain (Damm et al. 2012; Baroncelli et al. 2015).', 0.9980498552322388]]\nContext 3: [['The first formal report of strawberry anthracnose in China was made by Hu (1990) at the fifth annual conference of the Chinese Society of Plant Pathology, which took place in Jiangsu Province. In Shanghai, C. fragariae and C. acutatum were identified as strawberry pathogens (Shao 1992; Ye et al. 1997). Subsequently, fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was reported in Shanghai based on morphological identification (Dai et al. 2006). Molecular analysis using ITS sequences facilitated the identification of 16 C. gloeosporioides isolates and one C. acutatum isolate collected from 1996 to 2006 in Shanghai (Ren et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences and restriction enzyme digestion, 31 Colletotrichum isolates collected from diseased strawberries between 2006 and 2007 in Shanghai and Zhejiang were identified as C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae (Xie et al. 2010). Following this, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae were again reported as pathogens affecting strawberries in Zhejiang (Ren et al. 2011).

A phylogenetic analysis was performed using five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) to identify 91 different isolates from strawberry anthracnose samples. The species identified were C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, all belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, where it was found to be the second most common species. Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9956974983215332]]\nContext 9: [['Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum are known to cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.

The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006).

Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective.

Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997).

In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.', 0.9327919483184814]]\nContext 5: [['Since the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields is infected transplants, planting disease-free plants is the best control method.

However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts.

It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.\", 0.6953268647193909]]\n"

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

(2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011).

Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum.

A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998).

Comparative analyses of secretomes have revealed that most predicted secreted proteins possess enzymatic activity, with many identified as candidate effectors (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016; Sanz-Mart\u00edn et al., 2016). The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012).', 0.9723051190376282]]\nContext 3: [['Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.', 0.9311222434043884]]\nContext 4: [['Gan, P., Narusaka, M., Kumakura, N., Tsushima, A., Takano, Y., Narusaka, Y., Shirasu, K.

It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae.

The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini.

Such interactions are described by the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Race-non-specific resistance is less understood but is believed to be governed by multiple host genes that incrementally contribute to the overall resistance of the plant. Vanderplank proposed using analysis of variance to determine the contribution of race-non-specific and/or race-specific resistance within a host population against a group of pathogen isolates. The absence of a cultivar by isolate interaction is evidence of race-non-specific resistance using this method.

In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011).

Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species.

Isolates of C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides infecting strawberries were distinctly different in nuclear and A+T-rich DNA analyses, as well as in amplified fragment length polymorphism (AFLP) methods. Similarly, sequencing and restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) have been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species from strawberries. In populations of C. acutatum and C. fragariae from strawberries, little genomic variation was observed within each species using various molecular methods. In contrast, high diversity was observed in populations of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries, which possess the perfect stage. However, C. acutatum isolated from strawberries in Europe were distinct from American strawberry isolates.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.938086211681366]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008).

In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.5040314793586731]]\n"

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.6985244750976562]]\nContext 1: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel.

This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed.

This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots.

Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.5021191239356995]]\nContext 5: [[\"The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007).

Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial.

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose.

Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates.

The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.', 0.9867510795593262]]\nContext 1: [[\"Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.\", 0.9828239679336548]]\nContext 2: [['Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.', 0.9925009608268738]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).', 0.922752857208252]]\nContext 2: [['Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide.

In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986).

Sreenivasaprasad et al. (26) suggested that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberry are distinct from U.S. C. acutatum isolates found in a variety of hosts. In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California. Freeman and Katan (7) also observed identical RAPD patterns in pathogen isolates from both countries, suggesting that C. acutatum was introduced from the United States into Israel.', 0.407292902469635]]\nContext 6: [['The name C. fragariae was originally applied to isolates associated with a disease affecting strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) runners (stolons) and petioles in Florida (Brooks 1931).

Sutton (1992) accepted it as distinct, although he noted the confusion surrounding the application of the name. The designation of one of Brooks\u2019s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has provided a modern genetic basis for this name.

The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.963029146194458]]\nContext 2: [['To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.', 0.959121584892273]]\nContext 3: [['A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants.

In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011).

Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997).', 0.15056359767913818]]\n"

Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended.

Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6.

Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim.

This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.7870725393295288]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990).

(2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus.

The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance.

However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production.

However, conidia can also germinate by forming conidial phialides, which are specialized conidiogenous structures that produce secondary conidia without extensive mycelial growth. We recently reported that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods, resulting in up to a threefold increase in conidial populations on the leaf surface. In this study, conidial populations increased by up to tenfold on strawberry leaves when germination occurred in the presence of strawberry flower extracts. This suggests that ungerminated conidia exposed to flower extracts have a greater capacity to produce secondary inoculum on strawberry leaves than conidia germinating in water. The cause of the observed stimulatory effect is not clear, but it may be associated with nutrients or other stimulatory substances in the extracts. The stimulatory effects of flower extracts on C. acutatum multiplication were even more pronounced on coverslips, where conidial populations increased by up to sixteenfold. Excess nutrients and microorganisms on the leaf surface may have attenuated the effects of the extracts on leaves compared to coverslips. Nutrient deficiency, for example, has been associated with the induction of secondary conidiation by fungi such as Helminthosporium sativum and C. gloeosporoides in response to the inhibition of hyphal development. A stronger effect of nutrients in vitro than on host surfaces was also noted by Parbery and Blakeman in germination studies with C. acutatum.', 0.792173445224762]]\nContext 9: [['On strawberry plants, C. acutatum primarily causes black spot disease on the fruit but can also affect crowns, roots, and leaves (Freeman & Katan 1997), making it one of the most serious diseases in commercial fruit production. The conidia are formed in acervuli on the host, while in culture, they can also be produced in the aerial mycelium (Johnston & Jones 1997). C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on living strawberry leaves, stimulated by extracts from the strawberry plant, especially flower extracts (Leandro et al. 2001; Leandro et al. 2003). According to Buddie et al. (1999), secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia, and these are generally smaller and more variable in shape, which can obscure the differences between taxa. Additionally, C. acutatum forms simple pigmented appressoria but has few or no setae (Simmonds 1965).', 0.7446959614753723]]\n"

Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished).

Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel indicated that populations of C. acutatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable levels (S. Freeman, unpublished data).

The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010).

Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov.

Because nutrient behavior in soils is influenced by soil properties and environmental conditions, measuring these properties is essential. Key measurements include pH, salinity, organic matter (OM), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), as well as texture and aggregate stability.

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973).

Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al.

(3) found that adding phosphite (1.5 to 10 mM) to phosphate-limited Brassica nigra seedlings reduced plant growth. In phosphate-sufficient plants, only the 10 mM phosphite levels caused a reduction. Additionally, while the root-to-shoot ratios of phosphate-stressed plants were typically high (3, 11, 13), phosphite supplementation decreased the root-to-shoot ratio to about 40% of control values. Carswell et al. (3) explained these effects as a disruption of the phosphate-starvation response by phosphonates, causing phosphate-limited plants to behave as though they are phosphorus-sufficient. In our study, root-to-shoot ratios of tomato plants were also significantly lower for phosphorous acid-fertilized plants compared to no-phosphorus plants, indicating similar effects on phosphate metabolism. However, a combined treatment of 1 mM phosphate and 0.3 mM phosphorous acid increased leaf area significantly in two experiments, with a trend for greater leaf dry weight compared to phosphate treatment alone in three experiments. This finding might explain the labeling of commercial phosphite formulations as supplemental fertilizers for improved plant growth and increased crop yield. Additional studies are needed to evaluate possible interactions between phosphite and phosphate fertilizers. Phosphorous acid is readily absorbed by plants and is both xylem- and phloem-mobile (10). Using ion chromatography for quantifying phosphorous acid, Ouimette and Coffey (10) demonstrated that phosphonates are quite stable in avocado plants, persisting in this form for at least several months. Similarly, Robertson and Boyer (12) reported a biological inertness of organic and inorganic phosphites. In our experiments, phosphate concentrations in tomato plants treated with technical phosphite did not differ statistically from those of the no-phosphorus control plants. Phosphate levels in the solutions were not significantly different (P > 0.05) when freshly made or after one week in the recirculating hydroponic system, supporting previous work that molecular oxygen does not readily oxidize phosphonates in aqueous solutions (12). A general trend for higher phosphate levels was observed in the 1.0 mM phosphite solutions compared to the no-phosphorus treatment. In both fresh and aged solutions, measurable phosphate levels in the no-phosphorus and 1 mM phosphite treatments ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Contamination may have occurred from the salts used in the basic nutrient solution. In plants treated with a commercial formulation of phosphite, phosphate concentrations were significantly above those of the no-phosphorus treated plants. This increase could be explained by the slightly elevated phosphate levels in the nutrient solution. Decreased phosphate concentrations in the plant tissue of the 1 mM phosphate/0.3 mM phosphite treated plants compared to the 1 mM phosphate treated plants aligns with previous studies that showed growth of phosphate-sufficient plants in the presence of phosphite resulted in reduced root and leaf phosphate levels (3).

The disease progressed rapidly in affected seedlings, leading to significant development of the disease (mean rating of 3\u20134) in treatments supplemented with ammonium-N (Fig. 1), phosphate (Fig. 3), iron, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum (Fig. 4). At higher concentrations tested, infected seedlings often failed to emerge. Seedlings that showed no symptoms after 10 days typically remained healthy, even when left to mature (data not shown), likely due to the poor spread of the pathogen in rockwool (Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990).

The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).', 0.8409143686294556]]\nContext 2: [['This study highlights that temperature and the duration of intermittent wetness significantly affect germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development of C. acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves.

Increased conidial lysis at 35\u00b0C might explain the decreased conidial populations observed under continuous wetness at this temperature. Previous research on the effects of wetness duration on C. acutatum has mainly focused on strawberry fruit or in vitro studies, noting increased fruit rot incidence with longer wetness duration and reduced germination at relative humidity below 91%. In this study, longer wetness periods also favored conidial germination, which was notably low during shorter daily wetness periods of 4 hours.', 0.8347570300102234]]\nContext 3: [['The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field.

However, conidia can also germinate by forming conidial phialides, which are specialized conidiogenous structures that produce secondary conidia without extensive mycelial growth. We recently reported that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods, resulting in up to a threefold increase in conidial populations on the leaf surface. In this study, conidial populations increased by up to tenfold on strawberry leaves when germination occurred in the presence of strawberry flower extracts. This suggests that ungerminated conidia exposed to flower extracts have a greater capacity to produce secondary inoculum on strawberry leaves than conidia germinating in water. The cause of the observed stimulatory effect is not clear, but it may be associated with nutrients or other stimulatory substances in the extracts. The stimulatory effects of flower extracts on C. acutatum multiplication were even more pronounced on coverslips, where conidial populations increased by up to sixteenfold. Excess nutrients and microorganisms on the leaf surface may have attenuated the effects of the extracts on leaves compared to coverslips. Nutrient deficiency, for example, has been associated with the induction of secondary conidiation by fungi such as Helminthosporium sativum and C. gloeosporoides in response to the inhibition of hyphal development. A stronger effect of nutrients in vitro than on host surfaces was also noted by Parbery and Blakeman in germination studies with C. acutatum.', 0.550530195236206]]\nContext 6: [['Strawberry leaves (cv.

Conidia are splash-dispersed by rain (Denham and Waller, 1981; Chakraborty and Billard, 1995; Madden et al., 1996; Madden, 1997; Guyot et al., 2005; Buirchell et al., 2006), deposited on plant surfaces, and germinate. The germ tubes then produce appressoria, which form infection pegs that penetrate the host cuticle and epidermal cell walls (Perfect et al., 1999). Penetration through stomata or wounds by germ tubes without appressoria formation is rare (Zulqarnain et al., 1996). Infection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after a symptomless biotrophic phase, leading to a necrotic phase in which host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow both intra- and inter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogen has a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), with the switch to the necrotrophic phase occurring only when host tissue and environmental conditions favor the continuation of the infection cycle.

It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9896892309188843]]\nContext 1: [['Three species have been reported as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum acutatum J.H.

Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010).

Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.', 0.9577419757843018]]\nContext 8: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.9532435536384583]]\nContext 9: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.9381349682807922]]\n"

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.', 0.1289978325366974]]\nContext 5: [['Brasier, C.M.

Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.6490827798843384]]\nContext 2: [['Smith BJ, Black LL.

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.49786376953125]]\nContext 2: [['Although strawberries are considered a minor crop, they provide a significant source of income for many fruit and nursery growers. In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.', 0.45337966084480286]]\nContext 3: [['Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010).

In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.', 0.9723142385482788]]\nContext 3: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.958784818649292]]\nContext 4: [['Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop.

(teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum.

Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.', 0.950954258441925]]\nContext 5: [['Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.', 0.9489127397537231]]\nContext 6: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.9163228869438171]]\nContext 7: [['The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum.

Method 4, model I (fixed) based on F1s, and Method 2, model I (fixed), based on parents and F1s (half diallel), were used for the analysis of the main and secondary tests, respectively. These methods and models for combining ability analysis were selected because of the characteristics of the experiments in this study (i.e., a reduced number of parents were used without reciprocal crosses). When a limited number of parents are evaluated (<10) and the selection of these parents cannot be considered random, then a fixed model is recommended (Baker, 1978; Christie and Shattuck, 1992). Griffing\u2019s analysis of combining ability requires no special genetic assumptions beyond those necessary for the ANOVA and has been used to convey reliable information on the combining potential of parents (Baker, 1978; Christie and Shattuck, 1992).

However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues.

Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity.

Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species.

However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.9772872924804688]]\nContext 1: [['Despite intensive research that has contributed to the understanding of the Colletotrichum genus pathogenic to strawberries, there is still a lack of an accurate inventory of these causal agents. The population and prevalence of strawberry-virulent Colletotrichum species have not been systematically investigated in major producers such as China. To address these gaps, this review aims to summarize the biodiversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries by examining the global discovery history. Subsequently, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries in China was analyzed using available data. Finally, we categorized the host range of the two predominant species responsible for strawberry crown rot. This knowledge has important applications for biosecurity risk management (e.g., proper risk estimation in strawberry seedling trade), accurate diagnosis, and anthracnose control. It further lays the groundwork for systematically managing Colletotrichum genera in agricultural ecosystems, not only for the strawberry industry.', 0.9625579714775085]]\nContext 2: [['Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.', 0.9543463587760925]]\nContext 3: [['From a historical perspective, identifying the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose has faced considerable confusion at the species level for a long time. This process has gradually evolved from coarse estimates to precise identifications, as noted by Ji et al. in Phytopathology Research (2022). The first report of strawberry infection by C. fragariae occurred over 90 years ago in the southeastern USA (Brooks 1931). Morphological observations make it difficult to distinguish C. fragariae from C. gloeosporioides, the latter of which was described in the nineteenth century for a pathogen isolated from citrus in Italy (Penzig 1882). Consequently, early-stage strawberry anthracnose was often attributed to either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides.', 0.9322248101234436]]\nContext 4: [['Abstract: Colletotrichum fungi belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex include several economically significant postharvest pathogens that often cause anthracnose.

When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola.

Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single-gene identifications, which often led to identification at the species complex level rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton 1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae), became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010).

The characteristic features of these organisms are discussed, and it is concluded that it is necessary to designate a new form of C. gloeosporioides and one new species. Ripe fruit rots are a common source of loss in Queensland, particularly in tropical and subtropical fruits. Among the pathogens associated, species of the genus Colletotrichum are by far the most prevalent. Members of this group are particularly suited to this type of activity, and their ability to maintain a saprophytic existence on decaying host parts ensures a reliable source of inoculum. Additionally, by forming latent infections throughout the fruit's growing period, the parasite becomes largely independent of environmental conditions during ripening, not to mention the protection it gains from fungicides. Several distinct species of Colletotrichum are associated with ripe fruit rots in Queensland, and multiple species may be responsible for similar diseases on a single fruit variety. This paper attempts to categorize these species correctly while summarizing their main characteristics. It is hoped that the information presented will aid future determinations and enhance the understanding of the importance of individual diseases.\", 0.9873476028442383]]\nContext 8: [['Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has been reported as a common anthracnose pathogen in several guava-growing countries [74, 75, 77, 83]. In Hawaii, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been noted to infect guava leaves [76]. Intan Sakinah et al. (2014) [78] identified C. gloeosporioides sensu lato as the most prevalent species causing anthracnose in guava fruit, while suggesting that other species within the C. gloeosporioides complex may also be implicated in guava anthracnose. Additionally, Colletotrichum acutatum has been reported to cause anthracnose disease in guava [134\u2013136]. More recent multiple gene phylogeny studies aimed at identifying Colletotrichum species indicate that several species from the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes are associated with guava anthracnose. The C. acutatum complex includes C. simmondsii in Brazil [79], C. abscissum in Brazil and the USA [80, 82], and C. guajavae in India [12]. Among the species in the C. gloeosporioides complex associated with guava, C. psidii was detected in Italy [13], and C. siamense was found in India [81].

Additionally, C. aenigma and C. siamense have been reported to be associated with stem and fruit anthracnose in H. undatus grown in Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Sakhon, Thailand.

In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial.

To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts.

Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9979627132415771]]\nContext 1: [['C. siamense and C. fructicola are recognized as the primary pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose crown rot in the Asia-Pacific region (Nam et al. 2013; Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Gan et al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022).

(2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012).

Additionally, many tropical fruits like avocado, mango, papaya, and guava can suffer from postharvest decay due to quiescent infections established in the field.', 0.42705076932907104]]\nContext 6: [[\"The effects of preharvest calcium chloride (CaCl\u2082) treatment on postharvest ripening and gray mold development in strawberries (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) were assessed through two experiments conducted in 1987 at different sites.

Effects of preharvest and postharvest calcium treatments on peaches regarding decay caused by Monilinia fructicola. Plant Disease, 71, 1084-1086.', 0.2512737810611725]]\nContext 8: [['Fruit Hemibiotrophic Lifestyle (Blueberry, Apple, Stone Fruit): Fruit decays represent a common lifestyle of C. acutatum, leading to diseases such as blueberry ripe rot, apple bitter rot, and anthracnose of peach, along with numerous anthracnose diseases in subtropical and tropical fruits. In cases like bitter rot of apple and ripe rot of blueberry, acervuli are produced abundantly on mature fruit. Conidia from these acervuli are splash-dispersed, germinate to form appressoria, and establish quiescent infections on fruit, as demonstrated in peaches. These diseases can occur both in the field and post-harvest. However, most quiescent infections develop throughout the growing season. For blueberries, C. acutatum is also known to attack young leaves and other tissues, although this is rare. Thus, conidia from acervuli on leaves and decaying fruit may serve as a source of inoculum for other fruits, and the pathogen can survive as appressoria in bud scales and dead fruiting twigs. In apples, the source of inoculum is less obvious, as C. acutatum only causes disease on fruit. The fungus appears to be widespread in orchards and is easily isolated from both healthy and damaged tissue. In Michigan, where bitter rot is rare, C. acutatum remains prevalent in apple orchards and is commonly isolated, suggesting that it survives and reproduces as an epiphyte or endophyte, akin to the epiphytic\u2013short necrotroph lifestyle.', 0.24050287902355194]]\nContext 9: [['Infection Post-deposition: A study was conducted to determine if the micro-environment within the canopies varied in terms of favorableness for fruit infection. The effect of plant density treatment on fruit infection post-deposition was assessed by determining the disease incidence of inoculated, detached fruit placed within each treatment row canopy and in unsheltered areas adjacent to the plot site. Greenhouse-grown fruit (\u2018Midway\u2019) at the white stage were collected with the pedicels and inoculated in the laboratory as previously described (43), using a concentration of 1 \u00d7 10\u00b3 conidia/ml. This inoculum density produces a fruit disease incidence of approximately 0.5 with 12 hours of wetness at 25\u00b0C in controlled-environment chambers (41).', 0.23751859366893768]]\n"
