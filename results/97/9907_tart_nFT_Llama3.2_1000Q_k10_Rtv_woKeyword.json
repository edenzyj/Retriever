Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

            "Figure 1 illustrates the anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops, drawn by Latiffah Zakaria. Anthracnose pathogens infect not only fruits but also other plant organs, including leaves, flowers, twigs, and branches. The conidia and spores formed in these infected tissues are released and dispersed during rainy days or periods of high humidity, becoming the primary inoculum for fruit infection at the preharvest stage. The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions that contain conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions can merge to form larger lesions. These dark lesions on the fruit surface are unattractive to consumers and significantly reduce the market value of the affected fruits. Figures 2A\u2013E display anthracnose lesions on several tropical fruit crops.",
            "Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.",
            "Regarding pathogenicity and virulence to leaves and fruits, walnut fruits and leaves were inoculated with the 13 isolates. Infections occurred at the inoculation sites on both leaves and fruits (see Supplementary Fig. S2A to M), presenting symptoms similar to those of anthracnose observed in the field (Fig. 1). Control fruits and leaves showed no symptoms seven days after inoculation with blank agar plugs (see Supplementary Fig. S2N). Typical symptoms included roughly circular or irregular spots, with infections appearing water-soaked, sunken, and brown to black. The black lesions expanded and developed into necrotic areas. The fungus was reisolated from these lesions using the previously mentioned methods. Koch's postulates were fulfilled, confirming that all 13 isolates were indeed the walnut anthracnose pathogen.",
            "The greatest economic loss from anthracnose in strawberries is due to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum. This pathogen also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including blueberries, blackberries, grapes, tomatoes, peaches, and peppers (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often lead to stunted growth rather than plant death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplanting and produce few berries at harvest.",
            "The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.",
            "In terms of virulence, anthracnose symptoms can vary among different fruits based on factors such as the variety of the fruit, inoculum concentration, humidity, and temperature. Furthermore, pathogenic variation among Colletotrichum species infecting fruit crops has been documented. The diverse species of Colletotrichum that cause anthracnose in fruit crops also pose quarantine concerns. Fruits such as banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado are exported and imported worldwide, and latent infections are a key part of the disease cycle for anthracnose pathogens. This raises the possibility of these pathogens being distributed to new areas or regions.",
            "Surprisingly, free surface moisture was not required for sporulation. However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production. Therefore, it remains unknown whether other Colletotrichum species are similarly affected by moisture. We speculate that the pathogen acquires sufficient moisture from ripening strawberry fruit to produce conidia.",
            "Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has categorized Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly appear on aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.",
            "Fruit Hemibiotrophic Lifestyle (Blueberry, Apple, Stone Fruit): Fruit decays represent a common lifestyle of C. acutatum, leading to diseases such as blueberry ripe rot, apple bitter rot, and anthracnose of peach, along with numerous anthracnose diseases in subtropical and tropical fruits. In cases like bitter rot of apple and ripe rot of blueberry, acervuli are produced abundantly on mature fruit. Conidia from these acervuli are splash-dispersed, germinate to form appressoria, and establish quiescent infections on fruit, as demonstrated in peaches. These diseases can occur both in the field and post-harvest. However, most quiescent infections develop throughout the growing season. For blueberries, C. acutatum is also known to attack young leaves and other tissues, although this is rare. Thus, conidia from acervuli on leaves and decaying fruit may serve as a source of inoculum for other fruits, and the pathogen can survive as appressoria in bud scales and dead fruiting twigs. In apples, the source of inoculum is less obvious, as C. acutatum only causes disease on fruit. The fungus appears to be widespread in orchards and is easily isolated from both healthy and damaged tissue. In Michigan, where bitter rot is rare, C. acutatum remains prevalent in apple orchards and is commonly isolated, suggesting that it survives and reproduces as an epiphyte or endophyte, akin to the epiphytic\u2013short necrotroph lifestyle.",
            "Anthracnose can occur in avocados wherever they are grown, particularly during the wet season and in areas with high rainfall. Major infections typically affect the fruit, although leaves and stems can also be impacted. The dark lesions caused by anthracnose pathogens can rapidly expand on the fruit's surface and infect the pulp, leading to rot [84]."

            "The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.",
            "Accepted 20 August 2007. To overcome taxonomic problems associated with traditional identification methods, DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize and resolve the taxonomic complexity of some fungal genera, such as Fusarium (O\u2019Donnell et al., 1998), Pestalotiopsis (Jeewon et al., 2004), and Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005). Cannon et al. (2000) stated that data derived from nucleic acid analyses should provide the most reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, sequence analysis of the ITS regions proved useful in studying the phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum species (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005).",

            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",

Selva\u2019, and \u2018Camarosa\u2019, commonly grown in strawberry fields in Iran, were categorized as susceptible. Therefore, deploying relatively resistant cultivars such as \u2018Blackmore\u2019, \u2018Aliso\u2019, \u2018Mark\u2019, \u2018Diamant\u2019, and \u2018Yallova\u2019 could be effective in preventing disease development in regions where the disease is endemic. Additionally, cultivars with relative resistance may be crossed with commercial cultivars in breeding programs to improve and develop resistant varieties. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to evaluate the reaction of certain commercial strawberry cultivars against Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes strawberry AFR.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",
            "Pathogenicity trials conducted over three years using 12 distinct C. gloeosporioides isolates and 10 strawberry cultivars identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates. However, they failed to identify any cultivar by isolate interactions. A more limited study using two C. fragariae isolates inoculated on six strawberry cultivars during the third year also identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates, but similarly did not reveal any cultivar by isolate interaction. When the resistance rankings of cultivars were compared between the two pathogen species, a small but significant cultivar by species interaction was observed.",

The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

            "Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.",
            "Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",
            "The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",
            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",

            "Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum are known to cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was initially assumed to be the causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the United States. This fungus had previously been documented as causing anthracnose fruit rot of strawberries in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it had likely existed in the United States for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",

            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022)."

However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.",

This is partly due to a lack of certainty about the biological relationships between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "The time from infection of the strawberry by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is a critical factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. This period depends on the temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6 to 17 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may serve as a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may contribute to inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003).",
            "Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.",
            "Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.",
            "Strawberry fruits were inoculated with isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, both from strawberry and C. gloeosporioides from Limonium spp., either through wounding or non-wounding methods. Generally, no significant differences (P < 0.05) were detected in lesion size caused by the strawberry pathogens on fruit compared to those from the C. gloeosporioides Limonium isolate L-12, 9 days after either type of inoculation (Fig. 5).",
            "Inoculum: The isolate of Colletotrichum acutatum used in this experiment (ATCC 90170) was the same as in previous studies (33, 38, 39). To maintain pathogenicity, strawberry fruit were inoculated with the fungus regularly, and the fungus was then reisolated from infected fruit by scraping conidia from infected fruit and streaking on potato dextrose agar (PDA) (33, 39). Cultures were incubated in the dark at 25\u00b0C for up to 7 days. Spore suspensions were prepared by scraping conidia from cultures and suspending them in deionized water. The density was adjusted to 10^5 conidia per milliliter with the aid of a hemacytometer.",
            "The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.",
            "When N fertilizer is applied to strawberry plants as Ca(NO3)2, anthracnose crown rot severity should be less than when N is applied in ammonium forms. Anthracnose crown rot, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae, can infect all above-ground parts of the strawberry plant. Petiole and stolon infections are characterized by dark, sunken lesions, while leaf infections present as small black spots. When the crown is infected, it can lead to wilting and rapid plant death. An internal symptom of a crown infection is red discoloration, typically extending in a \u201cV\u201d shape from the side of the crown toward the center. Other pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum also cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.",

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",

Cano et al. provided a table of morphological characters and conducted sequence analysis based on a ribosomal DNA (rDNA) dataset to differentiate their clinical strains. Their phylogenetic analysis was relatively simple, relying on very short fragments of rDNA-ITS sequence (ranging from 124-174 bp) without comparison to the ex-type strains.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population.

            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

Smith and Black (1993) reported that all 16 C. acutatum, 14 out of 18 C. fragariae, and both C. gloeosporioides isolates tested in vitro were resistant to benomyl, and all benomyl-resistant isolates were also resistant to carbendazim, which belongs to the same class of fungicides as benomyl. In a greenhouse study, plants treated with propiconazole exhibited lower disease severity ratings than those treated with captafol or benomyl (Smith and Black, 1991). However, the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter, with dark green leaves that appeared thicker than the leaves of untreated plants.",

The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",

Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses from both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also diminished economic losses due to these diseases. Nevertheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental factors are highly favorable for anthracnose development.",

            "The role of alternative hosts in the disease cycles caused by C. acutatum is also not well understood. The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).",
            "While C. acutatum infections are frequently observed in strawberry production fields, it has been suggested that quiescently infected transplants from nurseries serve as the primary inoculum source for field infections (Howard et al. 1992; Peres et al. 2005).

However, during the hot summer months, extreme temperatures negatively impact the survival of C. acutatum in soil and plant debris (Ure\u00f1a-Padilla et al. 2001).",

            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "The development of cultivars resistant to red stele has been a primary objective of the USDA program.

In the Pacific Northwest, Waldo introduced \u2018Siletz\u2019 in 1955, marking the first red stele-resistant strawberry for this region. Since then, two other significant red stele-resistant cultivars, \u2018Hood\u2019 and \u2018Benton\u2019, have emerged from the cooperative USDA-Oregon State strawberry breeding program. Furthermore, the first day-neutral cultivars with multiple resistances to red stele, \u2018Tristar\u2019 and \u2018Tribute\u2019, were released from Beltsville in 1981 (Galletta et al., 1981).",

            "From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",

            "During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf.

Anthracnose crown rot, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae, can infect all above-ground parts of the strawberry plant. Petiole and stolon infections are characterized by dark, sunken lesions, while leaf infections present as small black spots. When the crown is infected, it can lead to wilting and rapid plant death. An internal symptom of a crown infection is red discoloration, typically extending in a \u201cV\u201d shape from the side of the crown toward the center. Other pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum also cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.",
            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).",
            "Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control."

            "In a study conducted in Zhejiang province, China, the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates was assessed on wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves. Most isolates, such as ZJE-3, exhibited strong pathogenicity on wounded leaves but weak pathogenicity on non-wounded leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) to identify 91 different isolates from strawberry anthracnose samples. The species identified were C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, all belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, where it was found to be the second most common species. Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth. Different colony types were observed, with a generally grayish-white appearance and slow hyphal growth under the tested culture conditions. The pathogenicity varied among C. siamense isolates, indicating a need for further research on their pathogenesis.",

Huangguan) under unwounded conditions up to 30 dpi. These findings reveal a clear organ specificity regarding the pathogenicity of some isolates.",

This is partly due to a lack of certainty about the biological relationships between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

            "Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has categorized Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly appear on aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.",
            "On certain fruits, such as apple and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), members of the C. acutatum species complex cause both pre-harvest and post-harvest diseases (Milholland, 1995; Jones et al., 1996; Shi et al., 1996). On these plants, asymptomatic, quiescent infections occur on unripe fruit, developing into necrotic lesions as the fruit ripens (Alkan et al., 2015). There are many other examples of post-harvest decay in fruits like peaches (Prunus persica), almonds (Prunus dulcis), avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), papaya (Carica papaya), and guava (Psidium guajava) that stem from quiescent infections that began in the field (Agostini et al., 1992; Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Smith, 1998; Afanador-Kafuri et al., 2003).",
            "On some hosts, such as apple and blueberry, C. acutatum poses a preharvest problem and also acts as a postharvest pathogen. Quiescent infections occurring before harvest develop as the fruit ripens, leading to ripe rot of blueberry and bitter rot of apple after harvest. Postharvest symptoms can also emerge with anthracnose diseases affecting peaches, almonds, and other stone fruits. Additionally, many tropical fruits like avocado, mango, papaya, and guava can suffer from postharvest decay due to quiescent infections established in the field.",
            "Papaya is a climacteric fleshy fruit typically harvested at the pre-climacteric stage, meaning that ripening begins after harvest, resulting in a relatively short shelf life. During this period, several fruit rot pathogens, including Colletotrichum spp., can cause damage. Although papaya anthracnose symptoms can occur in both fruits and leaves, Colletotrichum infections are usually more severe in fruits. Refrigerated papayas are particularly susceptible to disease; therefore, fruits intended for export may develop anthracnose symptoms as they ripen.",
            "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum species, is a significant postharvest disease of bananas. These pathogens can infect banana plants in plantations and remain latent. Bananas are often harvested before ripening, and as they ripen during storage, anthracnose symptoms manifest as brown or black lesions. These lesions can enlarge, become sunken, and produce spore masses. Mechanical damage, such as wounds and scratches on the banana peel from handling and transportation, exacerbates the symptoms [101], severely affecting the quality of bananas for both export and local markets.",
            "Fruit Hemibiotrophic Lifestyle (Blueberry, Apple, Stone Fruit): Fruit decays represent a common lifestyle of C. acutatum, leading to diseases such as blueberry ripe rot, apple bitter rot, and anthracnose of peach, along with numerous anthracnose diseases in subtropical and tropical fruits. In cases like bitter rot of apple and ripe rot of blueberry, acervuli are produced abundantly on mature fruit. Conidia from these acervuli are splash-dispersed, germinate to form appressoria, and establish quiescent infections on fruit, as demonstrated in peaches. These diseases can occur both in the field and post-harvest. However, most quiescent infections develop throughout the growing season. For blueberries, C. acutatum is also known to attack young leaves and other tissues, although this is rare. Thus, conidia from acervuli on leaves and decaying fruit may serve as a source of inoculum for other fruits, and the pathogen can survive as appressoria in bud scales and dead fruiting twigs. In apples, the source of inoculum is less obvious, as C. acutatum only causes disease on fruit. The fungus appears to be widespread in orchards and is easily isolated from both healthy and damaged tissue. In Michigan, where bitter rot is rare, C. acutatum remains prevalent in apple orchards and is commonly isolated, suggesting that it survives and reproduces as an epiphyte or endophyte, akin to the epiphytic\u2013short necrotroph lifestyle.",

Field isolations primarily yield conidial or sterile types. The aerial mycelium in these types is cottony or woolly, typically abundant and well elevated from the medium's surface, contrasting with the previously described variety. The coloration is usually white or varying shades of grey, while the substrate appears white to cream or varying densities of greyish olive or olive from below. Occasionally, forms with less abundant and elevated aerial mycelium emerge, which can be challenging to differentiate from the more elevated cultural types of C. gloeosporioides, unless conidia are present (as illustrated in Figures 2 and 3).",
            "Matthews (1953, 1955a, 1955b) investigated leaf spots occurring on a number of garden plants and weeds in the Brisbane district. In each case, the associated organism was isolated, and its cultural and morphological characteristics were described, followed by cross-inoculations. The causal organism was considered to be Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, though no attempts were made to distinguish between varieties. However, based on Matthews' papers, separation into G. cingulata and G. cingulata var. minor can be made with reasonable accuracy. Isolates from azalea (Rhododendron indicum Sweet), Hoya australis R.Br. and H. carnosa R.Br., and a few from stock (Matthiola incana (L.) R.Br.) were likely G. cingulata. Other investigated hosts yielded isolates resembling G. cingulata var. minor or its imperfect state, including stock, cabbage and broccoli (Brassica oleracea L. var.), alyssum (Lobularia maritima (L.) Desv.), wallflower (Cheiranthus cheiri L.), oleander (Nerium oleander L.), violet (Viola odorata L.), cestrum (Cestrum parqui L'Herit.), and pigweed (Portulaca oleracea L.).",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates are very similar to C. fragariae; however, they may form the Glomerella cingulata ascigerous state in culture, and their cylindrical conidia are usually rounded at both ends. Both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides isolates produce dark black setae in acervuli in culture, as well as on lesions found on petioles, stolons, and fruits. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture is slower than that of the other two species, especially at higher temperatures. Identifying Colletotrichum species based solely on morphological and cultural characteristics is challenging due to the overlapping ranges of various traits. A number of molecular methods have been employed to differentiate these species, including arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA), nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA, and species-specific primers based on the ITS regions (Freeman et al., 2000a; Lewis Ivey et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2007).",
            "Taxonomy within the genus Colletotrichum has long been unsatisfactory, with many poorly defined species. Arx (1957a, 1957b) endeavored to clarify the position. While this work has led to a useful simplification and highlighted the need for a significant reduction in the number of species, it is inevitable that among the synonyms listed by Arx, some species or groups will warrant separate status upon further investigation. This has been confirmed in the present work, where a previously described variety has been used to designate one such group. The following species are discussed: Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, stat. conid.; Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz.; G. cingulata var. minor Wr., stat. conid.; C. gloeosporioides var. minor var. nov.; C. musae (Berk. & Curt.)

With the introduction of a variety, the original species G. cingulata should strictly be referred to as G. cingulata var. cingulata. However, in this paper, reference to this species as originally understood has been made by simply omitting a varietal name when confusion is unlikely to occur.",
            "It is possible that some references in literature to G. cingulata pertain to organisms similar to var. minor. For instance, some described by Small (1926) as Colletotrichum coffeanum Noack appear to share characters with this variety. Cultures obtained from tea in Malaya and from avocado in Southern Rhodesia, through the courtesy of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, resembled C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland. Colletotrichum musae (Gloeosporium musarum), originally described from Queensland material, is undoubtedly the organism under discussion. In the literature, it has continued to be referred to by this name. With the general acceptance of Colletotrichum as the correct generic name for organisms formerly classified under Gloeosporium and Colletotrichum, it seems unjustifiable to continue using the binomial Gloeosporium musarum, and a transfer to Colletotrichum is desirable.",

Simmonds (1965) noted the impossibility of transferring G. elasticae to Colletotrichum because Colletotrichum elasticae had already been published for a different fungus. Rather than proposing a new name for Gloeosporium elasticae, he described C. gloeosporioides var. minus as a new variety, with a different type specimen.

A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000).

While this work has led to a useful simplification and highlighted the need for a significant reduction in the number of species, it is inevitable that among the synonyms listed by Arx, some species or groups will warrant separate status upon further investigation. This has been confirmed in the present work, where a previously described variety has been used to designate one such group. The following species are discussed: Glomerella cingulata (Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk, stat. conid.; Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz.; G. cingulata var. minor Wr., stat. conid.; C. gloeosporioides var. minor var. nov.; C. musae (Berk. & Curt.)

However, recent trends favor recognizing them as independent species. This approach simplifies nomenclature but may limit practical value for applied mycologists and plant pathologists, as the names do not necessarily indicate host specificity or nutritional/biological strategies. Unfortunately, many of these species cannot currently be reliably identified using single diagnostic (barcoding) sequences, making this aspect of their systematics a high priority for future research.

The ITS region has a limited ability to discriminate clades within this group; hence, a more appropriate biomarker is required for barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding should have low heterogeneity within species, yet enough variation to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications. It is also important that the gene can be easily sequenced for all species and does not require specific primers for each group (Seifert, 2009; Gilmore et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009).",

Under unwounded conditions, all isolates from the fruits were pathogenic at 30 dpi, with infection rates ranging from 2/6 for C. fioriniae (PAFQ19) to 5/6 for C. gloeosporioides (PAFQ61). These isolates began to induce small brown or dark brown lesions at different time points post-inoculation: 28\u201330 dpi for C. aenigma, C. conoides, and C. fioriniae; 18\u201322 dpi for C. gloeosporioides; and 6\u20138 dpi for C. siamense.

Notably, C. fructicola isolates PAFQ31 and PAFQ32 induced black spots (Fig. 21b2) and fruit rot symptoms (Fig. 21b3) at 30 dpi, similar to those observed on the leaves. This study revealed 12 species belonging to five Colletotrichum species complexes, including C. aenigma, C. conoides, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense, along with other species, confirming the involvement of C. conoides, C. siamense, C. wuxiense, C. citricola, C. karstii, and C. plurivorum in pear anthracnose for the first time.

All fruits tested in the study, including almond, apple, avocado, mango, and nectarine, are host plants of C. fioriniae (Guerber et al. 2003). In pathogenicity tests, MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that isolates from blueberry (identified as C. fioriniae) did not cause lesions on strawberry leaves but did induce anthracnose on strawberry fruits, although the lesions were smaller than those caused by isolates from strawberry (identified as C. nymphaeae). They concluded that the probability of an epidemic on strawberries in Florida caused by blueberry isolates is relatively low. However, they noted that climate could influence this, as ripe rot of blueberry fruits in Florida is primarily caused by C. gloeosporioides (sensu lato), whereas in temperate regions further north, it is more commonly caused by C. acutatum (sensu lato) (Smith et al. 1996). According to our study, both species are present on strawberries, but C. fioriniae appears to be of minor importance compared to C. nymphaeae.",
            "Isolation analyses of these Colletotrichum species from the sampled pear species revealed that C. fructicola isolates were dominant on P. pyrifolia and P. bretschneideri, accounting for 64.5% and 79.7% of the total isolates, respectively.

Additionally, C. siamense and C. fioriniae were isolated from P. communis, with incidences of 95% and 5%, respectively. The remaining species (C. citricola, C. conoides, C. jinshuiense, C. pyrifoliae, C. siamense, and C. wuxiense) were isolated at a low incidence of less than 5.0% from P. pyrifolia.",

Bernstein et al. (1995) identified most isolates collected from peaches in South Carolina as C. acutatum, with only one out of 19 being C. gloeosporioides. This sharply contrasts with our findings, as we only identified two C. acutatum isolates from the locations sampled (data not shown). This discrepancy may stem from our small sample size; however, a more plausible explanation is the inherent differences in fungicide sensitivity between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. Bernstein et al. (1995) found that C. acutatum strains were more resistant to benzimidazole fungicides (also known as MBC). The relative growth of C. acutatum isolates ranged from 17% to 47% at a discriminatory dose of 2 mg/ml benomyl, while none of the C. gloeosporioides isolates from peaches grew at that dose. MBC fungicides were more commonly used at the time of the Bernstein study for controlling various fruit diseases, which may have given C. acutatum a selective advantage. However, over the past two to three decades, MBC fungicides have gradually been replaced by new site-specific fungicides for disease management due to concerns over benzimidazole resistance in the major target pathogen, Monilinia fructicola (Zehr et al. 1991).",

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].",

However, most of these models are simple, considering only one component of the pathogen life cycle\u2014primarily conidial infection\u2014and focus on a single Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of these models have never been validated against independent data (i.e., data not used in model development). In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts. As a result, mechanistic models are considered useful for decision-making in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (De Wolf and Isard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al.

The first PCR amplified a 359-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene using primer pair GDF1/C-GAPDH-R from all Colletotrichum species. The cocktail also contained forward primer CALF1 and reverse primers Cg-R and Ca-R1, which produced amplicons of 649 bp or 491 bp in length from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and C. fructicola) or C. acutatum, respectively (see Fig. 5A). In the second PCR, primer pair G3F1/C-GAPDH-R generated a 280-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene from both C. siamense and C. fructicola, while primer pair CL1C/CALR1 generated a 550-bp fragment from the CAL gene from C. fructicola, but not from C. siamense (see Fig. 5B).

            "In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.",
            "Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.",

Flower blight and fruit rot were minimized when using irrigation systems and mulching types that reduced water splash. Organic materials, particularly dried grass mulch, significantly lowered disease levels under overhead irrigation. Conversely, organic mulches did not have a notable effect on disease levels under localized drip or low-pressure irrigation, likely due to the reduced water splash inherent to these practices.",

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",

Using a comparative genomics approach, we developed a marker to differentiate Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum aenigma, and Colletotrichum siamense within the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on PCR amplicon size differences. When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing different species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberries in Japan and contributes to our understanding of the diversity of anthracnose pathogens in the country.",
            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",

PHI test results (\u03a6w) < 0.05 indicate significant recombination within the dataset. Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single-gene identifications, which often led to identification at the species complex level rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton 1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae), became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010). This challenge prompted the use of molecular methods (Cai et al. 2009), which provide valuable data for clarifying the systematics of Colletotrichum (Hyde et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015). Xie et al. (2010) identified the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of strawberry cultivar Toyonoka in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China, to be C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. theobromicola using morphology and the ITS gene region alone. As the ITS gene alone does not effectively resolve Colletotrichum species (Martinez-Culebras 2002, Jelev et al. 2008, Xie et al. 2010), multigene analysis has been adopted to satisfactorily resolve Colletotrichum species (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014), and the present study has followed this protocol.",
            "Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.",
            "Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.",
            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems.",
            "For the past two decades, the causal agent of anthracnose affecting strawberries in Korea was believed to be Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, recent molecular analyses have indicated that the genus Colletotrichum has undergone significant taxonomic revisions, introducing several new species. Consequently, it has been revealed that C. gloeosporioides comprises more than 20 distinct species. Therefore, the Korean pathogen isolated from strawberries needs reclassification. The shape and size of the conidia of the pathogen were not significantly different from those of C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola, but they did differ in the shape of the appressoria. A combined sequence analysis of partial actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, and the internal transcribed spacer regions indicated that the strawberry isolates formed a monophyletic group with authentic strains of C. fructicola. Based on these results, the anthracnose fungi associated with domestic strawberries in Korea were identified as C. fructicola, distinguishing them from C. gloeosporioides.",

            "Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).",

            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",

Leaf samples were cleaned in running tap water for 3 minutes, surface-sterilized in 70% (v/v) ethanol for a few seconds, followed by treatment in 2% (w/v) sodium hypochlorite solution for 2 minutes, and rinsed with sterilized distilled water.

Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",
            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a significant disease affecting strawberry production. Surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected from affected areas, specifically strawberry nurseries and production fields in six states across the United States. The use of fungicides, particularly quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been widely employed for controlling C. acutatum for the past 20 years. Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group. This situation necessitates immediate changes in anthracnose management strategies to incorporate other chemical and non-chemical approaches, aiming to limit the selection of resistant populations and prevent future outbreaks.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance."

            "Based on properties of rain and the known effects of single-drop impacts on dispersal, there was a nonlinear relationship between rain intensity and the proportion of fruit exposed to the rain that became infected by Colletotrichum acutatum. Maximum fruit infection occurred at an intermediate rain intensity of about 30 mm/h. Although more spores were removed from the source as intensity increased, the wash-off of spores from potential infection sites also increased, leading to this nonlinear response.",

            "Surprisingly, free surface moisture was not required for sporulation. However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production. Therefore, it remains unknown whether other Colletotrichum species are similarly affected by moisture. We speculate that the pathogen acquires sufficient moisture from ripening strawberry fruit to produce conidia.",

            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).",

However, this fungicide is very active against B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew in strawberries (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.",

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity."

Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022).

They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

On these plants, asymptomatic, quiescent infections occur on unripe fruit, developing into necrotic lesions as the fruit ripens (Alkan et al., 2015). There are many other examples of post-harvest decay in fruits like peaches (Prunus persica), almonds (Prunus dulcis), avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), papaya (Carica papaya), and guava (Psidium guajava) that stem from quiescent infections that began in the field (Agostini et al., 1992; Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Smith, 1998; Afanador-Kafuri et al., 2003).",
            "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, is responsible for major losses in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) production worldwide. Fruit rot and flower blight are common symptoms in fruiting fields, while lesions on stolons, petioles, and leaves are particularly damaging in plant nurseries. C. acutatum may also cause crown rot and plant death in some regions. The pathogen is apparently introduced into production fields on infected or infested propagation material. During warm, moist periods, lesions formed on transplants produce abundant conidia that are splash dispersed onto flowers and fruits, resulting in new infections. However, when epidemics develop in fields where symptomless propagation material was planted, the source of initial inoculum is not clearly identifiable. Eastburn and Gubler suggested that the fungus is transported in infested soil attached to strawberry crowns, but the form and fate of fungal propagules from this potential inoculum source were not reported. Several studies have suggested that C. acutatum can develop quiescent infections on strawberry plants, but the epidemiological role of such infections prior to colonization of fruits and senescing foliage has not been investigated.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose, primarily caused by C. nymphaeae within the C. acutatum complex, is a leading disease limiting fruit yields in the United States (Damm et al. 2012; Legard et al. 2003; Legard and MacKenzie 2003; Mertely et al. 2017a, b; Wang et al. 2018). Characteristic symptoms of C. acutatum infections include flower blight and fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2017b; Peres et al. 2005; Smith 1998). Infected flowers may display brown lesions on the petals, while infected fruits typically present dark, sunken lesions with orange mucilage on their surface, rendering them undesirable for consumption (Peres et al. 2005). During severe epidemics, crown and root infections can also occur in nurseries, leading to stunted growth and reduced fruit production (Mertely et al. 2017a; Peres et al. 2005).",
            "Interestingly, all young tissues of key lime are susceptible and severely attacked by C. acutatum. However, on sweet orange and most other citrus crops, including Tahiti lime, only flower tissues are infected, leading to postbloom fruit drop; vegetative tissues remain immune. Isolates of C. acutatum from key lime induce symptoms of postbloom fruit drop on sweet orange, while isolates from affected sweet orange produce minimal anthracnose damage on key lime (6). This type of fruit drop is unique among diseases caused by C. acutatum, as symptoms are induced by plant hormones. Natural fruit abscission typically occurs at the peduncle base, but postbloom fruit drop results in abscission at the fruit's base, leaving persistent calyces and peduncles. Leaves surrounding infected inflorescences often become small and disfigured. Genes responsible for ethylene and jasmonic acid biosynthesis and indole-3-acetic acid regulation are highly induced by C. acutatum infection. Indole acetic acid levels can increase up to 140-fold in infected petals compared to healthy controls.",

It also affects citrus, apples, mangoes, papayas, and avocados, alongside C. gloeosporioides. In citrus, C. gloeosporioides is a common saprophyte and can cause postharvest anthracnose due to preharvest quiescent infections. Although C. acutatum does not cause postharvest anthracnose in citrus, it leads to specific diseases like postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose. On apples, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum both contribute to bitter rot, but C. acutatum is not known to infect apple leaves.",

This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots.

Unlike almond and avocado, which are perennial, strawberry is primarily an annual crop. Strawberry anthracnose, caused by species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae, leads to significant damage to both foliar and fruiting parts, as well as root necrosis.

C. acutatum is a known pathogen of the ornamental anemone, causing leaf curl disease. In cross-inoculation experiments involving anemone and strawberry, regardless of the isolate source (anemone or strawberry), all anemone plants died within 14 days of inoculation.

Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",

            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",

A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.",
            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide. Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.",
            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Four C. acutatum isolates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom development could be affected by the source of the isolate. The tested isolates, regardless of their origin, caused typical anthracnose symptoms on petioles, leaves, and stolons of both Chandler and Sharon cultivars 7 to 10 days after inoculation. After 30 days, 100% mortality was observed in all foliar-inoculated plants, compared to 0% mortality in the water control plants, which remained healthy thereafter.",

Additionally, the crop growth and tissue contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in the entire above-ground parts of the plant were investigated. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity, in contrast to phosphorus and calcium. Treatments using either ammonium (NH\u2084) or nitrate (NO\u2083) nitrogen showed no significant difference. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (R\u00b2 = 0.9078) and phosphorus (R\u00b2 = 0.8842), but was not influenced by higher levels of potassium (R\u00b2 = 0.8587) and calcium (R\u00b2 = 0.6526).",

Schrenk), which is considered a cumulative species and forms the sexual stage in some instances, is predominantly found as a postharvest disease affecting fruits such as avocado and mango. Strawberry may be infected by three Colletotrichum species: C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, causing anthracnose of fruit and other plant parts. Similarly, C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds has been reported to infect a large number of fruit crops, including avocado, strawberry, almond, apple, and peach. Citrus can be affected by four different Colletotrichum diseases: postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose, both caused by C. acutatum, as well as shoot dieback and leaf spot, and postharvest fruit decay, both caused by C. gloeosporioides. Other species with multiple host ranges include C. coccodes, C. capsici, and C. dematium.",
            "Table Comparison Summary A comparison of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado reveals differences in morphology and compatibility. Notably, the optimal growth temperature and growth rate on potato dextrose agar varied between isolates. The infected plant parts included leaves, twigs, and both immature and mature fruit, with some isolates showing compatibility and others absent. Additionally, benomyl sensitivity differed among isolates, highlighting the importance of molecular characterization in disease management.",
            "In fruit-rot assays conducted by Freeman and Shabi (1996), isolates from apple and peach (likely identifiable as C. fioriniae based on ITS sequence) produced lesions on various fruits, suggesting that isolates from this group have the ability to cross-infect fruit from multiple hosts. All fruits tested in the study, including almond, apple, avocado, mango, and nectarine, are host plants of C. fioriniae (Guerber et al. 2003). In pathogenicity tests, MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that isolates from blueberry (identified as C. fioriniae) did not cause lesions on strawberry leaves but did induce anthracnose on strawberry fruits, although the lesions were smaller than those caused by isolates from strawberry (identified as C. nymphaeae). They concluded that the probability of an epidemic on strawberries in Florida caused by blueberry isolates is relatively low. However, they noted that climate could influence this, as ripe rot of blueberry fruits in Florida is primarily caused by C. gloeosporioides (sensu lato), whereas in temperate regions further north, it is more commonly caused by C. acutatum (sensu lato) (Smith et al. 1996). According to our study, both species are present on strawberries, but C. fioriniae appears to be of minor importance compared to C. nymphaeae.",
            "In studies conducted in Israel, researchers aimed to determine whether avocado anthracnose was caused by the same subspecies of C. gloeosporioides responsible for almond anthracnose, particularly since almond groves are located alongside avocado plantations in certain cultivation areas. Similarly, other crops, such as anemone, apple, mango, and strawberry, are known to be susceptible to Colletotrichum in Israel. To evaluate the potential for cross-infection, isolates from different crops were cross-inoculated on various hosts.",
            "Figure Description Figure 1 illustrates typical anthracnose symptoms caused by C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum. Symptoms include lesions on immature almond fruit, wilting of leaves due to infection, and signs on mature avocado and strawberry fruit. Arrows in the figure indicate areas of sporulation, demonstrating the pathogen's impact on the fruits.",
            "Generally, conidia of C. acutatum are elliptic-fusiform in shape, whereas conidia of C. gloeosporioides are oblong with obtuse ends. However, this criterion, as well as the size of conidia, is not consistent enough for discerning species. Numerous reports suggest that isolates of C. acutatum grew at a significantly slower rate than isolates of C. gloeosporioides (5, 50, 52). However, the growth rate of C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond in Israel was slow and did not differ significantly from that of C. acutatum from strawberry. In fact, growth rate and optimal temperature have been useful for differentiating between subpopulations of C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond crops.",
            "VCG studies were conducted with isolates of Colletotrichum from almond (from Israel and the United States), avocado (Israel), and strawberry (Israel) crops to determine genetic relatedness within and between populations. The Israeli isolates of C. gloeosporioides and Californian isolates of C. acutatum from almond belonged to single, distinct VCGs and formed complementary heterokaryons only between mutants from different isolates within each population. Notably, almond isolates from Israel were not compatible with local isolates of Colletotrichum from avocado, indicating that the almond population constitutes a distinct subspecific group within C. gloeosporioides.",
            "The existence of the teleomorph Glomerella may sometimes help in differentiating between species; however, the sexual stage has only been observed in some isolates of C. gloeosporioides from avocado (T. Katan and S. Freeman, unpublished), but not from almond. In contrast to the morphological heterogeneity observed among C. gloeosporioides isolates from avocado, the population originating from almond in Israel had uniformly growing white-to-gray colonies. It can be concluded that colony color and shape of conidia are unsatisfactory methods for species identification, primarily due to the diversity of these characteristics in C. gloeosporioides, which is indicative of its heterogeneity.",
            "Our study demonstrated that C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango, as well as C. acutatum isolates from almond, anemone, apple, and peach, were able to infect detached fruits of other hosts, including two varieties of apple, avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine. These results indicated cross-infection potential between two species: C. gloeosporioides (including representatives of distinct subpopulations from almond, apple, avocado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach), across a variety of fruit species. However, these experiments were conducted under extreme conditions typical of artificial inoculations, whereas isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence of cross-infection occurring under field conditions.",
            "While the role and identity of species involved in anthracnose diseases is not always clear, we now have a much better understanding of the different species and the means to differentiate them. Almond anthracnose, for example, was previously thought to be caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, based on the morphology of the pathogen. More recently, almond isolates from California and Israel have been identified as C. acutatum, primarily through the use of molecular tools. These tools have been instrumental in determining not only the identities of isolates but also the relationships among them. The citrus postbloom fruit drop pathogen was also originally identified as C. gloeosporioides but was later found to be C. acutatum."

            "Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1\u03b1) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.",
            "The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) of ribosomal DNA has frequently been used to differentiate Colletotrichum species (Freeman et al. 2000), though it has not always been satisfactory (Cannon et al. 2012). Other markers, such as actin (ACT), beta-tubulin (TUB2), chitin synthase 1 (CHS-1), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), have also been utilized to resolve relationships among Colletotrichum species (Weir et al. 2012). Given the recent changes in the classification of Colletotrichum species and the limited information on the identity and characteristics of isolates causing mango anthracnose in China, the objectives of this study were as follows: (i) to identify and characterize species of Colletotrichum associated with mango anthracnose in Guangxi, China, based on morphology and DNA sequence comparisons; (ii) to examine the virulence of isolates from different parts of Guangxi province and assess whether there are geographical differences; and (iii) to investigate relationships among Colletotrichum spp. from mango using sequences of ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, and GAPDH.",
            "A similar set of six genes (ITS, ACT, CHS, GPDH, histone 3, and beta-tubulin) was used by Damm et al. (2009) to study Colletotrichum species with curved conidia from herbaceous hosts, which included six different clades. The best separability of the species was observed using both GPDH and histone 3 genes, which were superior to ITS, ACT, CHS, and beta-tubulin. The most appropriate gene for barcoding Colletotrichum must be selected during the species delimitation process since we can only choose one or more barcoding genes when we know which taxa need to be distinguished. A good approach would be to test and establish a selection of loci used by different groups involved in Colletotrichum systematics to work towards identifying the best barcoding gene.",
            "A polyphasic approach combining multilocus phylogenetic analysis with recognizable phenotypic characteristics is recommended for accurate species identification within the Colletotrichum genus. According to Weir et al., internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences alone are not reliable for distinguishing different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Additional loci recommended for identifying Colletotrichum species include actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase-1 (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2).",
            "Development of a molecular tool to distinguish Colletotrichum species affecting peach: A two-step multiplex PCR method was developed to differentiate Colletotrichum species affecting peach in South Carolina. The first PCR amplified a 359-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene using primer pair GDF1/C-GAPDH-R from all Colletotrichum species. The cocktail also contained forward primer CALF1 and reverse primers Cg-R and Ca-R1, which produced amplicons of 649 bp or 491 bp in length from the C. gloeosporioides species complex (C. siamense and C. fructicola) or C. acutatum, respectively (see Fig. 5A). In the second PCR, primer pair G3F1/C-GAPDH-R generated a 280-bp fragment from the GAPDH gene from both C. siamense and C. fructicola, while primer pair CL1C/CALR1 generated a 550-bp fragment from the CAL gene from C. fructicola, but not from C. siamense (see Fig. 5B).

Multiple sequence alignments were conducted using DNASTAR (DNASTAR Inc., Nevada City, CA) and CLUSTALX v. 2.1 (Larkin et al. 2007; Thompson et al. 1997). CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences of Colletotrichum species within the Musae clade (Weir et al. 2012) were obtained from GenBank as reference sequences, including those for C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. aenigma, C. aeschynomenes, C. alienum, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. musae, C. nupharicola, C. queenslandicum, C. salsolae, and C. tropicale (see Table 2). The maximum parsimony (MP) method and maximum likelihood (ML) methods were used to carry out phylogenetic reconstruction respectively using MEGA version 6.0 (Tamura et al. 2013). The MP tree was inferred using the subtree-pruning-regrafting (SPR) search option and 1,000 random sequence additions (level=1). For the ML tree, the following settings were used: the Tamura 3-parameter model, gamma distributed (5 categories), and heuristic method using SPR-extensive.

            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.",
            "Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).",

Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species.

The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",

            "Anthracnose diseases of yam are prevalent in all regions where the host is cultivated (e.g., Winch et al. 1984; Prasad & Singh 1960; Singh et al. 1966; Abang et al. 2002, 2003). Isolates from diseased yam leaves exhibit significant morphological (Winch et al. 1984) and genetic diversity (Abang et al. 2002). Both authors employed a broad species concept, grouping all yam-sourced isolates under the single name C. gloeosporioides. In this paper, we recognize part of that diversity as representing a distinct species, newly described as C. alatae. The type specimen of C. alatae aligns with the SGG (slow growing grey) group identified by Abang et al. (2002), which was noted to be more pathogenic to yam than other morphological and genetic groups recognized within C. gloeosporioides. This includes Nigerian isolates from Abang et al. (2002), as well as isolates from Barbados (SAS8 and SAS9 from Sreenivasaprasad et al. 1996), Guadeloupe (GenBank accession GQ495617), and India (CBS 304.67 and GenBank accession FJ940734), with no other host isolates identified.",

Additionally, Gloeosporium bomplandii Speg. was described from a host ambiguously identified as Dioscorea. Due to the broad genetic diversity among Colletotrichum species associated with diseased yam, the absence of cultures from these early type specimens, and uncertainty regarding the diversity they correspond to, we have opted not to apply these historical names to our newly recognized yam-specialized pathogen. The relationship between the post-harvest tuber rot, referred to as dead skin disease of yam (Abang et al. 2003; Green & Simmons 1994), and the Colletotrichum population associated with diseased foliage remains unclear.",

            "In 2021, Shanghai experienced its longest summer, lasting 162 days until mid-October, which is 52 days longer than the summer 60 years ago. This extended summer contributed to the outbreak of several diseases, including anthracnose crown rot, leading to increased mortality after transplanting in strawberry production fields. It is concerning to speculate that global warming may exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, changes in temperature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the specific responses of the disease triangle to these variations (Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2018). In an era of anthropogenic habitat modification and climate change, we must consider how to mitigate the impacts of global warming on sustainable strawberry development.",
            "Abundant anthracnose infestation was evident in many nurseries during the summers of 1995 and 1996, resulting in a massive collapse of transplants in soil-fumigated fields. Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel indicated that populations of C. acutatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable levels (S. Freeman, unpublished data). Therefore, the likelihood of persistent soil contamination by a soilborne inoculum of C. acutatum appears low, especially since soil fumigation is a standard practice.",
            "From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.",

However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.",

In one of these studies (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence of two subgroups within C. acutatum. The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberries and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses. Based on these molecular data, Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberries. Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).",
            "In Israel, where strawberries are cultivated near crops such as tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetables, as well as various weed species, the potential for cross-inoculation is of extreme importance. An identical genotype of C. acutatum was recovered from natural field infections of both strawberry and anemone in Israel. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to assess the persistence and interactions of C. acutatum on its primary host, strawberry, and other plant species that may serve as potential inoculum sources for this pathogen under suitable conditions.",
            "Fungal isolates: The 62 isolates of C. acutatum isolated from strawberry were selected from various collections representing a range of isolation dates (1978 to 1998) and geographic regions worldwide. Nineteen C. acutatum isolates from other host plants were included in the study for comparison. Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic. Additionally, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries originating from Europe and the United States, as well as one isolate from mango used as an outgroup, were studied. All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4\u00b0C as described by Perkins. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests. All isolates were identified using classical taxonomic criteria, such as conidial shape and growth on PDA.",
            "This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.",
            "Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries. A detailed consideration of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the context of strawberry anthracnose are crucial for understanding these dynamics.",
            "Differences in pathogenicity among strains from different hosts have been observed in several studies. Some fruit diseases caused by the C. acutatum complex have been shown to arise from distinct phylogenetic lineages (Peres et al. 2008), with strawberry fruit rot, in particular, rarely attributed to isolates from heterogeneous hosts (Mackenzie et al. 2009). Cross-infection potential was tested in various studies, including those by Bernstein et al. (1995), Freeman and Shabi (1996), Freeman et al. (2001b), and Mackenzie et al. (2007). Cross-infection may occur both in the field and in laboratory settings (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003). Freeman et al. (2001a) found that C. acutatum from strawberry could cause lesions on various fruits, whether they were wounded or intact. In vitro infection studies by Whitelaw-Weckert et al. (2007) revealed low host specificity among isolates that can be assigned to C. acutatum, C. simmondsii, and C. fioriniae.",
            "The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.",
            "A significant milestone occurred with the separation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides, when the former was identified as the causal agent of strawberry fruit rot in Australia (Simmonds 1965). In the 1980s, it was suggested that C. gloeosporioides was synonymous with C. fragariae in strawberries (Howard 1983; Smith and Black 1987). Although many pathologists attempted to differentiate among C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum (Smith and Black 1990; Gunnell and Gubler 1992), morphological distinctions remained ambiguous.",
            "Ninety-five isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberry) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberry), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) 2 sequence data provided clear genetic evidence of two subgroups in C. acutatum. The first subgroup, designated as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberry and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses."

Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",

In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000).

This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel.

Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.",

            "It is well established that surface topography (e.g., surface random roughness) significantly influences rain-splash dispersal of fungal plant pathogens. Increased surface roughness can often counteract the effects of increased rain quantity or intensity on spore dispersal. For example, straw mulch, commonly used in perennial strawberry production, substantially reduces disease spread in the field. In this study, increasing plant density produced a qualitatively similar effect to increased surface roughness, although the impact of plant density changes was less pronounced. While altering density alone may not suffice to manage diseases like anthracnose, it could be combined with other practices to enhance disease control. Moreover, density effects are directly relevant to the use of cultivar mixtures for controlling anthracnose and other diseases.",
            "The spread of strawberry anthracnose, resulting from the rain splash dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia, was determined in field plots by assessing fruit disease incidence at various distances from an introduced point source of infected fruit with sporulating lesions. Four within-row plant densities were established in replicated plots over two years. A generalized linear model with a logit link function and binomial distribution for incidence was used to quantify the effects of distance from the spore source, side of the row relative to the inoculum source, plant density treatment, and their interactions on disease incidence.",
            "Rain splash is the primary means by which conidia of Colletotrichum spp. spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduces the amount of rain penetrating the plant canopy, thereby decreasing splash. Most fruit infections occur within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997).",
            "Disease spread in the field is expectedly associated with rain events. However, as discussed previously (Madden, 1992; Madden et al., 1996), efforts to quantify properties of rain in relation to disease outbreaks or rates of disease development have yielded mixed results. Even when rain occurs, other weather variables, such as temperature, may correlate with disease variables just as strongly or even more so than rain itself. Given the complex effects of rain intensity, it is unsurprising that predicting disease increases based solely on rainfall is challenging.",
            "The complexity of the splash-dispersal system necessitates not only a detailed examination of individual mechanisms through controlled experiments (such as with a rain simulator) but also a phenomenological approach that evaluates the overall impact of density on disease spread over space and time for specific crops and pathogens. In this study, we assessed the development of anthracnose fruit rot from a point source of inoculum in strawberry plots planted at various densities over two seasons. A generalized linear statistical model, incorporating the spatial and plant density treatment aspects of the epidemic, was employed to quantify disease incidence.",
            "Discussion: The spread of anthracnose fruit rot was observed in strawberry plots over two years by determining disease gradients in relation to the distance from introduced point sources of Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum. Disease spread was strongly influenced by the canopy, as evidenced by the significant effect of canopy row side (relative to the inoculum source) and plant density treatment on the height and steepness of the disease gradients. The near side overall exhibited a higher disease incidence than the far row side, and there was generally a negative but nonlinear relationship between plant density and disease incidence.",

Spores were dispersed up to 50 cm from the yam leaf inoculum sources, though with an exponential decrease in dispersal with increasing distance. While few spores were dispersed via re-splashing from contaminated soil, the proportion deposited by this mechanism increased with distance from the initial source. We found no carryover of soil contamination from previous rains, suggesting that contamination via re-splashing from contaminated soils primarily occurred within single rain events. We conclude that most dispersal occurs from direct splashing, with a lesser contribution from indirect dispersal via re-splashing."

In the fungal kingdom, MAT idiomorphs code for transcription factors that regulate sexual development and recognition (Kronstad and Staben 1997). However, their configuration in Colletotrichum species appears to deviate from the majority of ascomycetes, where a single MAT locus (MAT1) exists as two alternate idiomorphs (MAT1-1 and MAT1-2) (Turgeon 1998). The exclusive presence of a MAT1-2 homolog in all species studied here supports the idea that the genetic control of sexual reproduction in this genus does not conform to any known system in the entire fungal kingdom (Rodr\u00edguez-Guerra et al. 2005; Crouch and Beirn 2009).",

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",

            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always sufficient for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species due to variations in morphology and phenotype influenced by environmental factors.",
            "None of the morphological characters of C. boninense allow for unequivocal identification, and misplacement of strains based solely on morphology is common. For instance, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological features but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study indicates that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. but rather to the C. boninense species complex, although its conidia largely resemble those of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio.",

Distinguishing Colletotrichum species morphologically has been challenging due to their phenotypic similarities and the influence of variable environmental factors on the expression of morphological traits. Consequently, all available morphological characteristics are often combined and used for systematic species discrimination.",
            "The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.",

Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).",
            "Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.",
            "Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",
            "In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.",
            "Many strains within the C. boninense aggregate exhibit the ability to produce a teleomorph. In contrast, the Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum have been inadequately studied compared to their anamorphs. Von Arx & M\u00fcller (1954) conducted a global revision based on morphological characters, and Uecker (1994) completed an ontogenetic study of a single C. gloeosporioides isolate. Evidence suggests that strains from most principal species aggregates, including the C. acutatum group (Guerber & Correll 2001; Guerber et al. 2003; Marcelino et al. 2008), the C. destructivum group (Armstrong-Cho & Banniza 2006, linked to an anamorph misidentified as C. truncatum), the C. orbiculare group (Rodriguez-Guerra et al. 2005), and the C. graminicola group (Crouch et al. 2009), can undergo meiosis.",

These papers often discussed morphological similarities among fungi from different hosts; however, the breadth of these similarities became of little practical use to plant pathologists. They provided minimal information regarding pathogenicity, host range, or other attributes of the Colletotrichum species described. The studies by von Arx & M\u00fcller (1954) and von Arx (1957) did not rely on direct examination of type material for all species, leading to questions about whether the species in question were indeed distinct. Some research attempted to explore the connections between various Colletotrichum species and their sexual Glomerella state (e.g., Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia 1925)."

It highlights the prevalence of anthracnose fruit rot in Iran and assesses the susceptibility of 52 commercial cultivars against the pathogen. The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",

Thus, resistance to anthracnose caused by isolate CA-1 of C. acutatum on strawberry runners appears to be quantitative in nature. This finding contrasts with previous studies (Gupton and Smith, 1991; Faedi and De Clauser, 1991; Winterbottom et al., 1991), which suggested major gene action for the inheritance of resistance. It is important to note that the mating scheme, method of genetic analysis, parental lines, and isolate of C. acutatum used in this study differ from those in earlier research, potentially leading to varying results.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

Samples collected from major strawberry-producing areas of Taiwan from 2010 to 2018 were subjected to morphological and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses. To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at various temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium, as well as their ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the UK and China (including Anhui, Hainan, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces, as well as Beijing and Shanghai), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose disease in subtropical regions."

            "Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "Figure 1 illustrates the symptoms of anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum nymphaeae on strawberry: (A) the initial symptom of anthracnose fruit rot on the surface of strawberry fruit; (B) exacerbated symptoms on the surface of strawberry fruit; (C) symptoms on the peduncle; and (D) symptoms resulting from an artificial inoculation test with an isolate.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Three species have been reported as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). These species cause similar symptoms on strawberries, including crown rot, fruit rot, and stolon lesions. In Europe, C. acutatum is the most prevalent species causing anthracnose, while C. gloeosporioides is found only occasionally, and C. fragariae has not yet been observed.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "When N fertilizer is applied to strawberry plants as Ca(NO3)2, anthracnose crown rot severity should be less than when N is applied in ammonium forms. Anthracnose crown rot, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae, can infect all above-ground parts of the strawberry plant. Petiole and stolon infections are characterized by dark, sunken lesions, while leaf infections present as small black spots. When the crown is infected, it can lead to wilting and rapid plant death. An internal symptom of a crown infection is red discoloration, typically extending in a \u201cV\u201d shape from the side of the crown toward the center. Other pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum also cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.",

Early symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) include blackening of specific tissues of the strawberry. These symptoms progress with the enlargement of lesions, which hinder proper fruit development and lead to the formation of orange-colored spores within the lesions. Similar symptoms were noted on the petioles, with sunken and blackened tissues similar to those on the fruit, accompanied by the formation of an orange conidial mass.",
            "The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum. Strawberry anthracnose diseases have been reported to be caused by C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (the teleomorph of Cromereilla cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), and C. dematium (Pers.) Grove. The latter species only occasionally causes strawberry fruit rots and will not be discussed here.",
            "Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range."

However, most of these models are simple, considering only one component of the pathogen life cycle\u2014primarily conidial infection\u2014and focus on a single Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of these models have never been validated against independent data (i.e., data not used in model development). In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts. As a result, mechanistic models are considered useful for decision-making in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (De Wolf and Isard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al.

            "The Bayesian tree obtained in this study indicates high genetic variability among the species occurring in Brazil, which is important for developing control strategies. A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.",
            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.",
            "Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.",
            "Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.",
            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "In America, where strawberry is widely cultivated, the diversity of strawberry pathogens is significant. In Canada, three species\u2014C. fructicola (Weir et al. 2012), C. nymphaeae, and C. lineola (Jayawardena et al. 2016b)\u2014were reported to infect strawberries. In the USA, at least six Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberry have been identified, including the dominant C. nymphaeae (Wang et al. 2019), along with C. simmondsii (Faedda et al. 2011), C. siamense (Adhikari et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022), the less prevalent C. fioriniae (Wang et al. 2019; Eaton et al. 2021), C. fructicola, and C. theobromicola (Weir et al. 2012; Oliveira et al. 2022). In Mexico, only Colletotrichum spp. at the genus level have been reported (Alvarez 1976; Rojas-Flores et al. 2019). C. nymphaeae infecting strawberry has also been recorded in Colombia and Costa Rica (Baroncelli et al. 2015). In Brazil, C. siamense (Capobiango et al. 2016) and C. karstii (Soares et al. 2021) were identified as pathogens. In Argentina, only the Colletotrichum species complexes (C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides) have been reported as infecting strawberries (Min\u00e1co et al. 2000; Ramallo et al. 2000).",
            "Strawberry anthracnose is a significant disease in China, leading to considerable economic losses. Several species of Colletotrichum are recognized as pathogens of strawberry. A survey of strawberry fields across eight provinces in China was conducted to identify the causal agents of this disease. The disease primarily manifests as crown rot, causing plant wilting and death during the nursery stage and after transplanting in greenhouses, making anthracnose a major threat to strawberry production and quality.",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",
            "The prevalence of Colletotrichum spp. pathogenic to strawberries in China has become a significant concern, as China has been the largest strawberry producer in the world since 2010, according to annual statistical data from the Strawberry Division of the Chinese Society for Horticultural Science. In 2021, strawberry growers on the Chinese mainland planted 173,333 hectares and produced five million tons of fruit (Zhang 2021). The diverse cultivation practices and climate conditions in China have favored a high biodiversity of various pathogens affecting strawberries."

            "The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.",
            "Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",

            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity."

            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",
            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.",
            "Molecular approaches have been successfully utilized for the taxonomic identification and determination of genetic diversity in Colletotrichum populations. Recent studies have employed species-specific primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from various hosts. To enhance the effectiveness of this approach for in vivo pathogen diagnosis, it is essential to develop simple and rapid DNA extraction techniques, enabling multiple sampling and testing.",
            "Traditional methods have not been satisfactory for differentiating between species and subspecies of Colletotrichum, leading to an increased popularity of molecular approaches over the last decade. Molecular methods have been successfully employed to differentiate between populations of Colletotrichum from various hosts, particularly from almond, avocado, and strawberry.",
            "A significant effort has been dedicated to identifying which species of Colletotrichum are involved in various anthracnose-type diseases of plants and developing tools for their identification and differentiation. Multiple hosts can be affected by a single species, while multiple species can impact a single host. Simmonds was the first to describe C. acutatum as a new species, distinct from others.",
            "Table 2 provides a comprehensive list of various species of the genus Colletotrichum, including their culture accession numbers and the host plants from which they were isolated. Each entry specifies the country of origin and includes corresponding GenBank accession numbers for the ITS, GAPDH, ACT, and CHS-1 genes. The species range from Colletotrichum aenigmay, isolated from Persea americana in Israel, to Colletotrichum boninense, derived from Crinum asiaticum in Japan. This detailed tabulation is essential for understanding the genetic diversity and distribution of Colletotrichum species in relation to their host plants.",
            "We explore our understanding of the ability of Colletotrichum acutatum to move between hosts and cause disease, as well as the genetic relatedness of isolates from different hosts.

            "Filamentous fungi of the genus Colletotrichum and its teleomorph Glomerella are considered major plant pathogens worldwide. They cause significant economic damage to crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by these pathogens. Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as anthracnose, characterized by sunken necrotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases can appear in both developing and mature plant tissues.",
            "Anthracnose is one of the main diseases affecting strawberry (Fragaria ananassa) production worldwide, causing significant yield losses and contributing to a large part of the fungicide schedule still adopted by Brazilian growers. Several species of Colletotrichum are associated with this disease, including C. fragariae, C. dematium, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum. Symptoms manifest on fruit, buds, blossoms, petioles, runners, crowns, and foliage. However, the two most destructive forms of the disease are crown rot anthracnose, usually caused by C. fragariae and primarily affecting roots, crowns, and fruit, and flower blight and fruit rot caused by C. acutatum.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has categorized Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly appear on aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.",
            "The distribution of Colletotrichum species that cause anthracnose in chili varies across different countries that cultivate this crop. For instance, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), while only three species have been reported in Thailand (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018) and five in Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b). The main Colletotrichum species known to cause anthracnose in chili are primarily from the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes. Recently, additional species from the boninense and orchidarium complexes have also been implicated (Diao et al. 2017; Damm et al. 2019). Therefore, understanding the taxonomy, diversity, pathogenicity, and distribution of Colletotrichum species affecting chili is essential.",
            "The parasitic activity of the pathogen begins by infecting young fruit at the \u201cpin head\u201d stage, approximately 4 to 6 weeks post-flowering. The first symptoms are typically detected on fruits that are 8 to 10 weeks old, appearing as dark, sunken lesions that can expand and coalesce, potentially affecting the entire fruit. Some infected berries may remain attached to the branches, serving as a secondary source of inoculum. Several cycles of pathogen development can occur up to the 25th week of fruit development, when the berries develop ontogenic resistance, coinciding with the onset of fruit endocarp hardening. The severity of Coffee Berry Disease (CBD) is highly dependent on climatic factors, particularly temperature, rainfall, and humidity. Rain is essential for the dispersal of conidia of Colletotrichum spp. Optimal temperatures for conidium germination and mycelial growth of C. kahawae on coffee are between 20 to 22\u00b0C. Appressorium formation occurs at these temperatures with relative humidity approaching 100%. Climatic conditions conducive to C. kahawae typically occur at high elevations (above 1,600 m), while disease incidence is minimal below 1,000 m. Agricultural practices may also influence disease severity. Currently, CBD is managed through host resistance, cultural practices, and chemical control. However, these management strategies could be implemented more efficiently as part of an Integrated Pest Management (IPM) strategy, which producers of Arabica coffee could adopt. This approach requires prior knowledge of the host-parasite-environment interactions that govern disease development.",

            "Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al. (1994).",

            "The shift towards multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has significantly changed the classification and species concepts within the Colletotrichum genus (Cannon et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013, 2014, Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

            "The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.",

            "Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",
            "(d) Yellow. A yellow isolate, similar to the one produced by G. cingulata, is occasionally obtained, although this is not found in field isolates. Some authors (Sutton, 1962) have suggested using the characteristics of the appressorium as one criterion for separating species of Colletotrichum. The size and shape of the appressoria formed by the species discussed here were briefly investigated, but the differences did not appear to be sufficient to warrant a more detailed examination. The mean length of the appressoria mostly ranged between 8 and 9 \u00b5m, with a mean breadth between 6.0 and 6.5 \u00b5m. The appressoria of C. atramentarium were somewhat larger, with a mean length of 11.3 \u00b5m, while those of C. musae were shorter, averaging 7.7 \u00b5m. The majority examined were more or less obovate, but in all species, a varying number of individuals were definitely lobed or angular. The appressoria of C. acutatum were generally more regular, whereas those of C. musae were less so.",
            "Differentiation of C. acutatum from Other Species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",
            "The Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum species are morphologically uniform, with ascospore size and shape being the only features attributed any diagnostic value.

The conidial and mycelial appressoria in C. hymenocallidis are larger than those in C. siamense (Prihastuti et al., 2009). Based on phylograms derived from CHS I and combined datasets of six genes, these species occur in two distinct clades (Fig. 2). Although the size and shape of conidia in C. gloeosporioides are similar to those of C. hymenocallidis, the latter grows slower under the same conditions (10 mm/day for C. hymenocallidis compared to 26.5 mm/day for C. gloeosporioides) (Cannon et al., 2008).

Based on our understanding of the gene-for-gene hypothesis, resistance genes can lose their effectiveness when faced with complex and evolving pathogen populations. Understanding the population structure and species distribution of pathogens can provide insights into optimal breeding strategies for durable resistance to anthracnose in mangoes and improve cultural controls.",

Mango orchards were sampled with a minimum distance of 2 km between samples. Lesion margins on mango leaves, branches, and fruits were cut into 3 mm \u00d7 3 mm pieces, surface sterilized with 75% ethanol for 15 seconds, and 1% sodium hypochlorite for 2 minutes, followed by three rinses in autoclaved distilled water for 30 seconds. Isolated fungi were cultured on potato dextrose agar (PDA) and kept at 25\u00b0C. Over two weeks, the cultures were examined daily. Isolates were placed on PDA slants for long-term storage at 4\u00b0C in the dark.",
            "Walnut (Juglans regia L.) is an economically important woody nut and edible oil tree worldwide. However, walnut production is limited by walnut anthracnose, a devastating disease that causes significant yield losses. Studying the etiology of anthracnose on walnut, as well as the virulence of pathogens and their sensitivities to fungicides, would be beneficial for effective control. This study aimed to identify the pathogen responsible for walnut anthracnose and reveal the population diversity through assessments of virulence, fungicide sensitivities, and genetic variation. A total of 13 single-spore Colletotrichum isolates were collected from walnut anthracnose-diseased fruits and leaves in 13 commercial orchards across Henan, Hubei, Shandong, and Shaanxi provinces in China. The isolates were identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) based on multilocus phylogenetic analyses (internal transcribed spacer, actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase), as well as morphological and cultural characteristics, and pathogenicity. Inoculation of the same walnut tissue with different isolates resulted in varying disease lesion sizes. The results indicated considerable differences in the virulence of all isolates, with no correlation to geographic origins. The virulence observed in walnut leaves and fruits inoculated with the same isolate was also significantly different. Based on their virulence to walnut leaves and fruits, the 13 isolates were categorized into three groups. Notably, 69.2% of the isolates exhibited higher virulence to walnut fruits compared to leaves, while 15.4% of isolates showed no virulence at all.",

A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides.

For instance, soil type, ground cover, plant canopy, and host density all significantly impact spore dispersal through splashing. Vegetation may act as a barrier, limiting the reach to neighboring hosts. Ground cover has been shown to effectively limit splash dispersal, with neighboring canopy leaves reducing dispersal by 90% compared to bare ground [12]. The presence of weeds is estimated to decrease overall dispersal distance by half [17]. Additionally, splash dispersal varies across canopy stages, with splashes from the upper sides of leaves causing infections at the tips, while splashes from the lower sides infect the base of leaves [18]. Moreover, the effects of splashing can vary between and within species ([19], [20]).",

As noted previously, while increasing density might lead to more units becoming infected, the rising total number of units could result in a constant or even decreasing proportion of diseased units. There is clear evidence from certain systems that the dispersal of spores or other microscopic particles, such as pollen, diminishes as plant density increases. Interestingly, recent studies showing no correlation between plant density and disease in natural systems have focused on heteroecious rusts, which do not have secondary spread. Therefore, any observed effects would likely be due to altered dispersal dynamics associated with increased density or changes in environmental conditions.",

In the comparison of observed and predicted disease progress curves, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) ranged from 0.862 to 0.991, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.014 to 0.055. Across all three epidemics, CCC was 0.95, RMSE was 0.036, and the calibration regression model (CRM) was -0.023, indicating a slight tendency toward overestimation (Table 5). An example of model output for the dematium clade is shown in Figure 4 for JA-94. Disease assessment began in June after the summer pruning of mulberry trees and ended in November.

There was a total of 625.5 mm of rain over 61 rainy days, and a total of 1688 hours of leaf wetness (Figure 4A). Regularly distributed rainfall ensured that the epidemic would progress during the season, starting from the time of disease onset in August until November, when a sharp increase in disease led to a 37% disease incidence (Figure 4B).

Calibration was performed at the clade level due to a scarcity of information at the species level. When there was no data for a specific clade, the model utilized the parameterization of other clades. This was evident in the effects of wetness on sporulation, which was primarily documented only for the acutatum clade affecting olive and strawberry (Leandro et al., 2003; Moral and Trapero, 2012), and for the seasonal availability of primary inoculum on olive (Moral and Trapero, 2012).

Epidemics on olive developed between August and December, with final disease incidence on drupes ranging from 7% to 26% (Table 5).

            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

            "The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field. This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2-3 days at 25\u00b0C to 6-17 days at 5\u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C, the latent period for C. acutatum was shorter than that for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species were similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may significantly contribute to inoculum sources for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may help maintain inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness durations than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves exposed to flower extracts than those exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), indicating that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may rise during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally decreased with increased plant density, concluding that higher density reduces rain penetration into the canopy and thus splash dispersal. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied splash dispersal of conidia from three Colletotrichum spp. and discovered that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while C. acutatum conidia traveled the farthest, likely due to a higher spore production on infected fruit. Colletotrichum acutatum conidia can survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but both conidia and sclerotia die quickly in moist conditions when soil moisture exceeds 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",

It was likely that the only gene affected by the pAA1 hairpin was CtCut1. The pAA1 plasmid was versatile, containing restriction enzyme sites that facilitated the creation of a hairpin cassette for silencing any gene, provided the primers used were designed with compatible restriction enzyme sites.

A 1354-bp DNA fragment containing regulatory sequences, along with the sense and antisense of GFP interrupted by the C. truncatum cutinase (Accession number HQ406775) intron to form a hairpin structure, was synthesized and cloned into the HindIII-EcoRI digested site of pJF1, producing the pJF1_ShhGFP fungal silencing plasmid (DNA2.0, USA).

A notable reduction in the mRNA levels of CtCut1 (ranging from 14.9% to 72%) was observed across the transformed strains, with no significant changes in morphology, growth rate, or conidiospore production.

The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.",

Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.",

The objective of our study was to compare the effects of several macro- and microelements (including various ammonium-N sources, nitrate-N, sodium phosphate, iron, molybdenum, and copper-, magnesium-, manganese-, and zinc-sulfates) on disease severity and the growth of tomato seedlings. Mineral nutrients were tested across a range of concentrations to provide more information for developing a fertilizer-based management strategy and for integrating mineral fertilizers with other control approaches (e.g., biocontrol) that may be sensitive to mineral levels."

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

'MSUS 98' plants exhibited lower disease severity ratings compared to 'MSUS 37' or 'MSUS 70' when averaged across all treatments. Plants receiving 160 ppm N had higher disease severity ratings than those receiving 0 ppm N or 40 ppm N. The highest disease severity ratings were recorded for plants treated with 160 ppm of (NH4)2HPO4, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4Cl.

Manganese may enhance the synthesis of host defense products, potentially reducing disease incidence and severity.

Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci.

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini.

Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).",

            "Three isolates of C. miaoliense were collected from Miaoli County and Nantou County, Taiwan. Multi-locus analysis revealed that C. miaoliense forms a robust clade distinct from other known species in the C. acutatum species complex. Among the six Colletotrichum species in this complex (C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii) identified as anthracnose pathogens of strawberry, C. miaoliense is most closely related phylogenetically to C. nymphaeae and C. simmondsii. Morphologically, C. miaoliense differs from C. nymphaeae (CBS 515.78) in conidial size (16.1 \u00d7 2.3 \u2013 4.9 \u00d7 0.7 \u03bcm versus 14.2 \u00d7 1.1 \u2013 4.1 \u00d7 0.34 \u03bcm), conidial shape (one end round and the other rounded to acute, contrasting with the new species where both ends are acute), and appressoria size (8.7 \u00d7 2.5 \u2013 5.5 \u00d7 1.0 \u03bcm versus 7.5 \u00d7 1.0 \u03bcm).",
            "Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum can be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories (Cai et al. 2011). Several of these lineages have now been systematically classified as species complexes comprising closely related sibling species (Weir et al. 2012). Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). Additionally, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex. However, different species do not require the same level of control when encountered in the field (Prihastuti et al. 2009).",
            "Considering the frequency with which strains from the C. acutatum species complex are encountered and their pathogenicity to a wide range of crop plants, it would be surprising if earlier names for C. acutatum did not exist. Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.",
            "Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).",
            "Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili have previously been identified as C. acutatum (characterized by straight conidia with acute ends), C. gloeosporioides (straight conidia with obtuse ends), and C. truncatum (falcate conidia) (Than et al. 2008; Mongkolporn et al. 2010). However, recent multigene phylogenetic analyses have revealed that C. acutatum is a species complex (the acutatum complex) consisting of 34 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with seven species identified as responsible for anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Similarly, C. gloeosporioides has been found to be a complex of 38 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with nine species identified as pathogens of chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Morphological traits are insufficient to differentiate many species with straight conidia, particularly those in the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes affecting chili. Thus, multigene phylogenetic analyses are essential for accurate species identification (De Silva et al. 2017a)."

Root-dip inoculated seedlings were transplanted into trays filled with a 1:1 mixture of Canadian peat and vermiculite. These media were prepared using factorial combinations of calcium carbonate (CaCO\u2083) at rates of 0.75 or 3.0 kg\u00b7m\u207b\u00b3, calcium nitrate [Ca(NO\u2083)\u2082] or ammonium sulfate [(NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084] (each providing 225 mg N/liter), and sodium chloride (NaCl) at either 0 or 2000 mg Na/liter as experimental treatments.",
            "Abstract: This study evaluates how host nutritional variables affect the severity of crown and root rot in tomatoes caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici. Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.",
            "Two-week-old seedlings of the \u2018Walter\u2019 tomato variety were root-dip inoculated in Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) inoculum prepared by blending potato glucose agar cultures in sterile deionized water, diluting to a final concentration of 5 \u00d7 10^6 spores per milliliter. The root dip also involved crowns and a portion of the hypocotyl. The inoculated seedlings, 15 per container, were transplanted into plastic trays measuring 18.5 \u00d7 24.5 \u00d7 2.5 cm, containing approximately 0.002 m\u00b3 of a mix of 1 part Canadian peat to 1 part vermiculite.

Calcium carbonate was included in the dry mix, while 200 ml of solutions of the nitrogen sources and NaCl were applied to the trays before planting the inoculated or non-inoculated seedlings. This application was repeated weekly until the end of the experiment.",
            "The form of nitrogen significantly influenced both the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and the growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg\u00b7L\u20131).",
            "Heremans (1996) developed a rapid method for screening tomato plant resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (Med. Fac. Landb. Toeg. Biol. Wetensch. Univ. Gent 61(2A):337\u2013341). Huber and Watson (1974) examined nitrogen form and plant disease (Annu. Rev. Phytopathol. 12:139\u2013165). Jarvis (1988, 1992) contributed significantly to managing diseases in greenhouse crops (Phytoprotection 69:49\u201364; APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.). Jarvis and Thorpe (1980, 1981) studied the effects of nitrate and ammonia nitrate on Fusarium severity and soil amendment with lettuce residues for disease control (Plant Dis. 64:309\u2013310; Can. J. Plant Pathol. 3:159\u2013162).",
            "The exact way mineral nutrients influence disease is uncertain, but effects on pathogen activity and host susceptibility are likely involved. Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997).",

Bonnie Best), which were 2-3 days old and had sprouted primary roots measuring 2-4 mm in length on 0.85% water agar at 24 \u00b0C, were planted in rockwool cubes (3.5 cm in diameter and 4 cm deep; one seed per cube; Grodania A/S, Hedehusene, Denmark) placed in square plastic trays (5.5 cm deep). The rockwool was saturated with 800 mL of a dilute (1/4 strength) Knop nutrient solution containing the following concentrations (in mg\u00b7L\u20131): calcium nitrate (Ca(NO\u2083)\u2082\u00b74H\u2082O) at 250; potassium phosphate (KH\u2082PO\u2084), potassium chloride (KCl), and magnesium sulfate (MgSO\u2084\u00b77H\u2082O) at 62.52 each; and F2 e-EDDHA (ethylenediamine-di(o-hydroxyphenylacetic acid)).",
            "The influence of nitrogen nutrition on the sensitivity of tomato plants to culture filtrates of Fusarium and to fusaric acid is discussed in \"Physiology and Plant Pathology,\" volume 23, pages 257\u2013263. Bochow et al. (1996) detail modes of action in biocontrolling fungal seedling and root rot diseases by Bacillus subtilis in the proceedings of the IOBC WPRS Bulletin, volume 19, pages 99\u2013108. Duffy and D\u00e9fago (1997) highlight that zinc amendment improves biocontrol of tomato crown and root rot by Pseudomonas fluorescens and represses the production of pathogen metabolites that inhibit bacterial antibiotic biosynthesis (Phytopathology 87:1250\u20131257).",
            "Our results build on those of Woltz et al. (1992) and provide a foundation for developing a control strategy based on plant nutrition. Such an approach has been successfully applied to manage other Fusarium diseases (Jarvis, 1992; Jones et al., 1989). The effects of mineral nutrients on crown and root rot of tomatoes caused by F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycospersici were similar to those reported for other formae speciales, reflecting the adaptability of control strategies for various Fusarium diseases. This further suggests a biological similarity of these pathogens and/or similar responses of diverse hosts to these fungi. However, fusarium crown and root rot is not the only issue threatening hydroponically grown tomatoes, and nontarget effects of certain mineral nutrients on other diseases must be considered. A prominent example is nitrate-N, which reduces crown and root rot but increases the severity of economically devastating diseases caused by Pythium and phytopathogenic bacteria (Stanghellini and Rasmussen, 1994). Integrating mineral nutrients with newly developed resistant cultivars, biocontrol agents, and/or fungicides used at reduced, non-phytotoxic concentrations may enhance the level and spectrum of disease control.",
            "Crown rot severity increased with the lower CaCO\u2083 rate, the use of (NH\u2084)\u2082SO\u2084, and the addition of supplemental NaCl. Data on the fresh weight of seedlings, expressed as percentage values relative to non-inoculated controls, supported observations regarding the impact of Fusarium crown rot on tomato seedlings. Some Fusarium oxysporum f. sp. radicis-lycopersici (FORL) isolates may attack the roots aggressively, while others act as weak pathogens. This disease has been a notable issue in Florida (Jones et al., 1990) and is also recognized in greenhouse and field settings elsewhere (Brammall and McKeown, 1989; Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980; Vakalounakis, 1988)."

Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.",

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998). Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).",
            "Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.",
            "Traditionally, Colletotrichum species are identified based on morphological characteristics, including conidial and appressorial size and shape, the presence of acervuli, setae, or sclerotia, sexual structures, and cultural traits such as growth rate and colony color. Distinguishing Colletotrichum species morphologically has been challenging due to their phenotypic similarities and the influence of variable environmental factors on the expression of morphological traits. Consequently, all available morphological characteristics are often combined and used for systematic species discrimination.",
            "Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",
            "Differentiation of C. acutatum from Other Species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",
            "In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.",
            "To address the inadequacies of traditional identification methods, molecular techniques have been employed to characterize and identify taxa within Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Abang et al., 2002; Moriwaki et al., 2002; Peres et al., 2002; Guerber et al., 2003; Photita et al., 2005; Du et al., 2005; Shenoy et al., 2007b; Whitelaw-Weckert et al., 2007; Peres et al., 2008; Than et al., 2008a-c). Cannon et al. (2000) noted that nucleic acid analyses provide a reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. The combined use of molecular diagnostic tools alongside traditional morphological techniques is currently an effective approach for studying Colletotrichum species complexes (Cannon et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2009).",
            "This is the first report characterizing Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of mango in Guangxi province, China, using morphological identification and phylogenetic analysis. The morphological features of the isolates corresponded to the description of C. gloeosporioides. However, cultural characteristics, which may vary due to cultural conditions, and conidial morphology cannot distinguish between species within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Based on morphological identification, single gene sequence analysis, and five-gene combined phylogenetic analysis, the isolates obtained from mango in Guangxi belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex. C. gloeosporioides has been previously identified as the causal agent of tropical fruit rots, including mango, and the present study confirmed that all 29 isolates from mango leaves with anthracnose symptoms across a 450 by 300 km region belong to this species complex. In contrast, Phoulivong et al. (2010) reported that C. gloeosporioides was not a common pathogen in the tropics and was not responsible for mango anthracnose in Thailand or Laos.",
            "Corresponding to the taxonomic classification determined by multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, most Colletotrichum species exhibited characteristic morphological features, including colony colors, the density of aerial mycelium, and the shapes and sizes of conidia, ascospores, appressoria, and setae (Fig. 7\u201318). These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017).

Additionally, these species differed in their ability to form a sexual morph in culture.",
            "The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, Thailand, based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data. A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the..."

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",

            "The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers. However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management."

            "Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.",
            "Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, particularly in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts (Sutton 1992). The typical symptoms of Colletotrichum infections include sunken necrotic lesions, often bearing orange conidial masses, referred to as anthracnose (Freeman et al. 1998). The impact of these pathogens on fruit crops is significant, causing severe yield losses; for example, bitter rot is one of the most critical diseases affecting apple fruit, potentially leading to yield losses of up to 50% (Sutton 1990).",

            "Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",

Currently, 23 species of Colletotrichum are recognized as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa. Two species were rejected due to incorrect citations (C. paranaense) or because they are not pathogenic to strawberries (C. clidemiae). Notably, it has been suggested that about 30% of ITS sequences in open databases, including GenBank, are linked to incorrect taxa of fungi, such as those in the Colletotrichum genus (Hofstetter et al. 2019; Boufleur et al. 2021). Thus, future identification and acceptance of novel species as causal agents of crop anthracnose should be performed rigorously, following the rules of both taxonomy and plant pathology, and should rely not only on multiple barcode genes but also on whole genome sequencing.",

            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al.

Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",
            "Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, particularly in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts (Sutton 1992). The typical symptoms of Colletotrichum infections include sunken necrotic lesions, often bearing orange conidial masses, referred to as anthracnose (Freeman et al. 1998). The impact of these pathogens on fruit crops is significant, causing severe yield losses; for example, bitter rot is one of the most critical diseases affecting apple fruit, potentially leading to yield losses of up to 50% (Sutton 1990).",
            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit.

After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Von Arx (1957) regarded Gloeosporium phormii as a synonym of C. gloeosporioides. However, in the phylogeny of Farr et al. (2006), strains of this species cluster with C. acutatum and C. lupini. Morphological and cultural differences revealed C. phormii as a distinct lineage, which we have confirmed in our study. Colletotrichum phormii can be distinguished from the closely related C. salicis (and indeed from all other species in the C. acutatum complex) by its elongate, large conidia and large appressoria. The species appears to be host-specific to Phormium spp. Recently, Takeuchi & Hori (2006) reported C. gloeosporioides from Phormium in Japan. However, based on dimensions of conidia (10\u201316.5 \u00d7 4\u20136 \u00b5m) and appressoria (7\u201317 \u00d7 4\u201311.5 \u00b5m) and the shape of the conidia\u2014cylindrical with broadly rounded ends (see fig. 3 of that paper)\u2014the fungus seems to belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex rather than one of the two C. acutatum complex members from Phormium treated in this study.",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates are very similar to C. fragariae; however, they may form the Glomerella cingulata ascigerous state in culture, and their cylindrical conidia are usually rounded at both ends. Both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides isolates produce dark black setae in acervuli in culture, as well as on lesions found on petioles, stolons, and fruits. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture is slower than that of the other two species, especially at higher temperatures. Identifying Colletotrichum species based solely on morphological and cultural characteristics is challenging due to the overlapping ranges of various traits. A number of molecular methods have been employed to differentiate these species, including arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA), nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA, and species-specific primers based on the ITS regions (Freeman et al., 2000a; Lewis Ivey et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2007).",
            "A significant milestone occurred with the separation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides, when the former was identified as the causal agent of strawberry fruit rot in Australia (Simmonds 1965). In the 1980s, it was suggested that C. gloeosporioides was synonymous with C. fragariae in strawberries (Howard 1983; Smith and Black 1987). Although many pathologists attempted to differentiate among C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum (Smith and Black 1990; Gunnell and Gubler 1992), morphological distinctions remained ambiguous.",
            "Colony shape and color of cultures may vary considerably within and between species. For instance, most isolates of C. acutatum (including the almond pathogen from California) show red-salmon pigmentation in reverse culture, whereas the coloration of C. gloeosporioides cultures varies from white to dark gray. Several morphological types have been observed within a population of C. gloeosporioides from avocado grown in culture (T. Katan, unpublished): (i) conidial type, with masses of conidia and no aerial mycelium; (ii) flat mycelial type, with very little aerial mycelium or conidia; (iii) mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium; (iv) conidial-mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium and masses of conidia; (v) protoperithecial type, similar to type iv but also producing dark protoperithecia-like hyphal aggregates; and (vi) perithecial type, with simple or complex perithecia.",
            "Cylindrical conidia from various studies have been synonymized with the name C. gloeosporioides (Phoulivong et al., 2010). However, some of these synonymies were later found to be incorrect. For instance, C. acutatum (Simmonds, 1965) and C. boninense (Moriwaki et al., 2003) were segregated from C. gloeosporioides, as defined by von Arx (1957). Additionally, several species previously regarded as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx were subsequently identified as members of the C. acutatum or C. boninense species complex (Damm et al., 2012a, b).",
            "Ap-PCR was effective in accurately differentiating between C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae from strawberry: C. acutatum and C. fragariae populations shared a common band pattern, while C. gloeosporioides patterns were polymorphic. This method proved useful for taxonomic identification of strawberry isolates from South Carolina as C. acutatum based on unique amplification products, determining the uniformity of Israeli C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, and demonstrating heterogeneity within C. gloeosporioides as illustrated by multiple band patterns.",
            "Generally, conidia of C. acutatum are elliptic-fusiform in shape, whereas conidia of C. gloeosporioides are oblong with obtuse ends. However, this criterion, as well as the size of conidia, is not consistent enough for discerning species. Numerous reports suggest that isolates of C. acutatum grew at a significantly slower rate than isolates of C. gloeosporioides (5, 50, 52). However, the growth rate of C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond in Israel was slow and did not differ significantly from that of C. acutatum from strawberry. In fact, growth rate and optimal temperature have been useful for differentiating between subpopulations of C. gloeosporioides from avocado and almond crops.",
            "Considering the frequency with which strains from the C. acutatum species complex are encountered and their pathogenicity to a wide range of crop plants, it would be surprising if earlier names for C. acutatum did not exist. Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.",
            "Many strains within the C. boninense aggregate exhibit the ability to produce a teleomorph. In contrast, the Glomerella morphs of Colletotrichum have been inadequately studied compared to their anamorphs. Von Arx & M\u00fcller (1954) conducted a global revision based on morphological characters, and Uecker (1994) completed an ontogenetic study of a single C. gloeosporioides isolate. Evidence suggests that strains from most principal species aggregates, including the C. acutatum group (Guerber & Correll 2001; Guerber et al. 2003; Marcelino et al. 2008), the C. destructivum group (Armstrong-Cho & Banniza 2006, linked to an anamorph misidentified as C. truncatum), the C. orbiculare group (Rodriguez-Guerra et al. 2005), and the C. graminicola group (Crouch et al. 2009), can undergo meiosis.",
            "Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili have previously been identified as C. acutatum (characterized by straight conidia with acute ends), C. gloeosporioides (straight conidia with obtuse ends), and C. truncatum (falcate conidia) (Than et al. 2008; Mongkolporn et al. 2010). However, recent multigene phylogenetic analyses have revealed that C. acutatum is a species complex (the acutatum complex) consisting of 34 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with seven species identified as responsible for anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Similarly, C. gloeosporioides has been found to be a complex of 38 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with nine species identified as pathogens of chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Morphological traits are insufficient to differentiate many species with straight conidia, particularly those in the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes affecting chili. Thus, multigene phylogenetic analyses are essential for accurate species identification (De Silva et al. 2017a)."

Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth. Different colony types were observed, with a generally grayish-white appearance and slow hyphal growth under the tested culture conditions.

The table shows the temperatures (\u00b0C) as follows: C. murrayae (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 38.8 b), C. gloeosporioides (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 40.0 a), C. fructicola (10.0 a, 28.4 a, 36.0 c), C. aenigma (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 36.0 c), C. nymphaeae (10.0 a, 28.0 a, 34.0 d). Means with the same letters are not significantly different (P \u2264 0.05). Table 5 outlines the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum isolates on strawberry, with data presented as mean \u00b1 standard deviation. The disease index was evaluated 20 days after inoculation, and the percentage of plant mortality was assessed 30 days post-inoculation. Mean percent mortality of strawberry due to conidial suspension of Colletotrichum spp. was measured by spray methods.",
            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",
            "The experiment assessed the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola on various weed species and its influence on strawberry plants. It was found that C. fructicola is not pathogenic on strawberries. Among the weed species tested, Amaranthus blitum exhibited the highest infection rate, with 17.9% affected by C. fructicola (see Table 2). Other weeds, such as Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Solidago altissima, Erigeron annuus, and Sonchus oleraceus, showed relatively low detection rates (4.3% to 8.1%) without displaying symptoms. Notably, C. fructicola was not isolated from the remaining seven weed species, which included Senecio vulgaris, Cyperus microiria, Lamium amplexicaule, Portulaca oleracea, Alopecurus aequalis, Capsella bursa-pastoris, and Cerastium glomeratum. The fungus was isolated more frequently from warm-season weeds compared to cool-season ones (refer to Table 2).",
            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.",
            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",
            "Anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern U.S. since the 1930s. The causal fungus, Colletotrichum fragariae, infects all above-ground parts of the plant; however, the disease is most severe when it infects the crown, leading to crown rot, wilting, and plant death. Additionally, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has been a problem since the late 1970s, while the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum, was first reported in the U.S. in 1986. Scientific investigations of anthracnose have focused on its epidemiology, the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species, their infection processes, and pathogenicity. Findings from these studies have significantly improved control measures for this disease.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production."

            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",

Cannon et al. (2000) noted that nucleic acid analyses provide a reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. The combined use of molecular diagnostic tools alongside traditional morphological techniques is currently an effective approach for studying Colletotrichum species complexes (Cannon et al., 2000; Cai et al., 2009).",
            "Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",

            "In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.",
            "Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998). Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).",

Given the global importance of this genus, primarily consisting of plant pathogens, it is critical to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to enhance biosecurity and disease control efforts. Traditional methods of species identification have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues. As stated by Sutton (1992), relying solely on morphology is insufficient for improving the systematics of species complexes like C. gloeosporioides.",

This evolution has made traditional classifications less practical, as holotypes and other types are not very useful since DNA cannot usually be extracted. It is recommended that future studies adopt a polyphasic approach before introducing new species of Colletotrichum or designating epitypes. This approach should integrate molecular, morphological, physiological, and pathogenic data.",

They cause significant economic damage to crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by these pathogens. Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as anthracnose, characterized by sunken necrotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases can appear in both developing and mature plant tissues.",
            "The shift towards multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has significantly changed the classification and species concepts within the Colletotrichum genus (Cannon et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013, 2014, Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

The implication of Colletotrichum species as entomopathogens may seem surprising; however, the insects involved are sap-suckers. C. fioriniae has been found widely as an endophyte (Marcelino et al. 2009) in both the host plant of the scale insect (Tsuga canadensis) and a diverse range of associated plants. This represents a case of mutualism between Colletotrichum and its host plants, with endophytic strains serving as natural protectants against insect herbivory. A similar occurrence was reported for a strain labeled C. gloeosporioides f. sp. ortheziidae (likely belonging to C. nymphaeae) parasitizing the economically significant citrus scale insect Orthezia praelonga in Brazil (Cesnik et al. 1996).

These characteristics are vital for the development of commercial mycoherbicides aimed at controlling specific weeds like northern jointvetch."

            "On some hosts, such as apple and blueberry, C. acutatum poses a preharvest problem and also acts as a postharvest pathogen. Quiescent infections occurring before harvest develop as the fruit ripens, leading to ripe rot of blueberry and bitter rot of apple after harvest. Postharvest symptoms can also emerge with anthracnose diseases affecting peaches, almonds, and other stone fruits. Additionally, many tropical fruits like avocado, mango, papaya, and guava can suffer from postharvest decay due to quiescent infections established in the field.",
            "Papaya is a climacteric fleshy fruit typically harvested at the pre-climacteric stage, meaning that ripening begins after harvest, resulting in a relatively short shelf life. During this period, several fruit rot pathogens, including Colletotrichum spp., can cause damage. Although papaya anthracnose symptoms can occur in both fruits and leaves, Colletotrichum infections are usually more severe in fruits. Refrigerated papayas are particularly susceptible to disease; therefore, fruits intended for export may develop anthracnose symptoms as they ripen.",
            "C. acutatum manifests symptoms on flowers, leaves, petioles, and roots, but it is most significant as a fruit rot pathogen in strawberries. It also affects citrus, apples, mangoes, papayas, and avocados, alongside C. gloeosporioides. In citrus, C. gloeosporioides is a common saprophyte and can cause postharvest anthracnose due to preharvest quiescent infections. Although C. acutatum does not cause postharvest anthracnose in citrus, it leads to specific diseases like postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose. On apples, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum both contribute to bitter rot, but C. acutatum is not known to infect apple leaves.",

            "Anthracnose can occur in avocados wherever they are grown, particularly during the wet season and in areas with high rainfall. Major infections typically affect the fruit, although leaves and stems can also be impacted. The dark lesions caused by anthracnose pathogens can rapidly expand on the fruit's surface and infect the pulp, leading to rot [84].",
            "Two distinct types of diseases occur: those affecting developing fruit in the field (preharvest) and those damaging mature fruit during storage (postharvest). The ability to cause latent or quiescent infections has categorized Colletotrichum among the most important postharvest pathogens. Species of the pathogen predominantly appear on aboveground plant tissues; however, belowground organs, such as roots and tubers, may also be affected.",
            "Anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl\u2082 developed less fruit rot than that from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl\u2082 (Smith and Gupton, 1993). The primary means to reduce the buildup of anthracnose fruit rot in the field is to harvest fruit frequently and remove all rotten fruit. Following severe infections early in the fruiting season, all infected fruit should be stripped from the plants and removed from the field. Infected areas of a field should be harvested last in the day, or workers should wash up and change to clean clothes when entering uninfected areas of the field after harvesting areas with fruit rot present.",
            "In terms of virulence, anthracnose symptoms can vary among different fruits based on factors such as the variety of the fruit, inoculum concentration, humidity, and temperature. Furthermore, pathogenic variation among Colletotrichum species infecting fruit crops has been documented. The diverse species of Colletotrichum that cause anthracnose in fruit crops also pose quarantine concerns. Fruits such as banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado are exported and imported worldwide, and latent infections are a key part of the disease cycle for anthracnose pathogens. This raises the possibility of these pathogens being distributed to new areas or regions.",
            "On certain fruits, such as apple and blueberry (Vaccinium spp.), members of the C. acutatum species complex cause both pre-harvest and post-harvest diseases (Milholland, 1995; Jones et al., 1996; Shi et al., 1996). On these plants, asymptomatic, quiescent infections occur on unripe fruit, developing into necrotic lesions as the fruit ripens (Alkan et al., 2015). There are many other examples of post-harvest decay in fruits like peaches (Prunus persica), almonds (Prunus dulcis), avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), papaya (Carica papaya), and guava (Psidium guajava) that stem from quiescent infections that began in the field (Agostini et al., 1992; Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Smith, 1998; Afanador-Kafuri et al., 2003)."

            "Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating anthracnose diseases and their causal agents. Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",
            "Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries. A detailed consideration of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the context of strawberry anthracnose are crucial for understanding these dynamics.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum has been regarded as a pathogen of countless host plant species and is thought to occur everywhere. Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) discovered that C. acutatum group A5, accepted here as C. acutatum s. str., occurs only on certain hosts, primarily in the southern hemisphere. This study confirms that C. acutatum s. str. does indeed have multiple hosts, but the known host spectrum is much smaller than previously accepted.",
            "Few investigations into cross-pathogenicity and the host range of C. acutatum isolates in nature have been conducted. If this pathogen truly has a broad host range and can move freely between hosts, it is intriguing that it has formed unique relationships with each plant species. Many researchers face limitations due to narrow crop responsibilities, inadequate facilities for handling temperate or tropical crops, or restrictions imposed by biosecurity regulations, which have hindered studies of host ranges using large numbers of isolates. With innovation and cooperative efforts, it may be possible to conduct some of these studies, ultimately enhancing our understanding of pathogen movement and host interactions.",
            "The objective of this study was to investigate the inheritance of high and intermediate plant resistance to C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 2 to enhance understanding of anthracnose resistance. An 8 \u00d7 8 factorial design was employed, focusing on analyzing the disease's intermediate resistance, indicating that minor genes may also contribute to resistance in certain cultivars, such as Belrubi. The intermediate level of resistance was found to be quantitative and governed by minor genes. Analyzing 26 genotypes and cultivars from Fragaria spp. revealed that the dominant gene is not rare in the germplasm of F. \u00d7 ananassa, and anthracnose resistance is also present in other Fragaria species. These findings hold significant implications for breeding efforts aimed at enhancing anthracnose resistance.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).",
            "Considering the frequency with which strains from the C. acutatum species complex are encountered and their pathogenicity to a wide range of crop plants, it would be surprising if earlier names for C. acutatum did not exist. Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al.

            "Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.",
            "For instance, Botrytis fruit rot of strawberries, caused by Botrytis cinerea, primarily occurs at lower temperatures during winter and spring (Elad et al. 2007); however, Colletotrichum species typically require warmer temperatures and predominantly cause anthracnose in strawberries during the summer (Henz et al. 1992; Xie et al. 2010). The minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures are important biological traits widely used to characterize microorganisms (Damm et al. 2012a,b; Prihastuti et al. 2009; Weir et al. 2012). In this study, no significant differences were observed in the minimum and optimum growth temperatures of the five Colletotrichum species, but their maximum growth temperatures varied (as detailed in Table 4).",

            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems.",
            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",
            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",
            "A diverse collection of Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato was assembled for this study, including 67 isolates associated with strawberry production in the UK (obtained from the UK Food and Environment Research Agency, FERA, which is responsible for plant health within the Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs), 27 C. acutatum sensu lato isolates collected from strawberries in other countries, and 13 isolates collected from other host species in the UK. For further comparison, 33 additional isolates were included to represent other genetic groups and novel species from previous studies. This included two isolates of C. fruticola, two isolates of C. aenigma (belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex) associated with strawberries, two UK isolates of C. spinaciae, and one isolate each of C. graminicola, C. higginsianum, and C. fioriniae. Sequence data for the markers were retrieved from the reference genome sequences available from GenBank for C. graminicola and C. higginsianum (accession numbers: ACOD01000000 and CACQ02000000, respectively), which were used as out-groups in the phylogenetic analysis (Fig 1). Details of the isolate collection used in the present study are provided in Table 1."

            "The first simplification in the design of our model concerns the role of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola clades (De Silva et al., 2017). However, perithecia rarely occur in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main type of inoculum in disease development. The model, therefore, focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, with asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli being regarded as the only inoculum responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics. Excluding a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein, 1963), potentially delaying epidemic growth (Schein, 1963), especially during rainless periods. This is because ascospores can be forcibly discharged from perithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity (Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).",

In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the..."

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",

Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants.

            "Tropical fruit crops are susceptible to infection by Colletotrichum species, which typically cause anthracnose. The anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops is summarized in Figure 1. Infection often occurs in the fields during the flowering and fruiting stages. Various factors, including humidity, temperature, fruit condition, and inoculum concentration, can influence Colletotrichum infection.",
            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.",
            "The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field. This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2-3 days at 25\u00b0C to 6-17 days at 5\u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C, the latent period for C. acutatum was shorter than that for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species were similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may significantly contribute to inoculum sources for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may help maintain inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness durations than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves exposed to flower extracts than those exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), indicating that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may rise during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally decreased with increased plant density, concluding that higher density reduces rain penetration into the canopy and thus splash dispersal. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied splash dispersal of conidia from three Colletotrichum spp. and discovered that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while C. acutatum conidia traveled the farthest, likely due to a higher spore production on infected fruit. Colletotrichum acutatum conidia can survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but both conidia and sclerotia die quickly in moist conditions when soil moisture exceeds 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "Discussion: The spread of anthracnose fruit rot was observed in strawberry plots over two years by determining disease gradients in relation to the distance from introduced point sources of Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum. Disease spread was strongly influenced by the canopy, as evidenced by the significant effect of canopy row side (relative to the inoculum source) and plant density treatment on the height and steepness of the disease gradients. The near side overall exhibited a higher disease incidence than the far row side, and there was generally a negative but nonlinear relationship between plant density and disease incidence.",
            "The time from infection of the strawberry by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is a critical factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. This period depends on the temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6 to 17 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may serve as a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may contribute to inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003).",
            "The fungus was shown to survive on asymptomatic leaves of several plant species under greenhouse conditions (12). Studies suggested that symptomless foliage might play an important role in the anthracnose disease cycle, acting both as a refuge for fungal survival and as a source of inoculum for fruit and flower infections (12, 19, 33). Temperature and wetness have been reported to affect mycelial growth (1, 7, 11, 21, 37, 39), as well as the germination and sporulation of C. acutatum on agar (11), and its infection and sporulation on fruit (18, 39). However, similar studies on strawberry foliage have not been conducted. Additionally, the production of secondary conidia was not addressed in earlier research.",

            "In a related study, the severity of anthracnose fruit rot, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, was also reduced with the application of Ca(NO3)2 on greenhouse-grown strawberries. Similar findings were reported regarding the control of Fusarium diseases in tomatoes and chrysanthemums. Notably, there was a significant variation in foliar N levels among different strawberry clones, suggesting that N applications should be customized for each cultivar. Nonetheless, the trend of decreased anthracnose severity with nitrate fertilizers was consistent across five strawberry clones tested, indicating that other cultivars may respond similarly.",
            "These results indicate that strawberry growers can adjust their fertilizer practices by opting for Ca(NO3)2 as their N source. This adjustment can help reduce the severity of anthracnose crown rot while ensuring adequate foliar N levels necessary for optimal growth and production. As anticipated, foliar N levels increased with higher treatment N levels, while P and K levels did not influence foliar N.",
            "The application of nitrogen (N) in the form of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) significantly reduced the severity of anthracnose crown rot in strawberries. In contrast, the levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in fertilizers did not have a similar effect. Plants receiving N as Ca(NO3)2 exhibited fewer symptoms of anthracnose crown rot compared to those receiving N in ammonium form. Although these trials were conducted with potted plants in a greenhouse, the findings are applicable to strawberries grown in sandy soils, typical of Florida.",
            "However, the effect of nitrogen on disease management can vary depending on the disease. Ammonium sulfate has been shown to be more suppressive of black root rot in strawberries than Ca(NO3)2. The objectives of these studies were to determine (i) the influence of N, P, and K levels, and (ii) the influence of N source and concentration on the severity of anthracnose crown rot.",
            "Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 led to greater disease suppression and enhanced plant growth compared to Ca(NO3)2, though yield was not significantly affected. Past studies have shown that (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot and increased yield in strawberry (6) and suppressed root diseases in other crops (5, 10, 11). Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 did not impact the recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. from roots but did increase root weight and the number of lesion nematodes. Since P. penetrans is an obligate parasite that must live in living roots, it is reasonable to find lower densities of this pathogen on roots of dead and declining strawberries, as evidenced in the Ca(NO3)2-treated plants, compared to healthier plants treated with (NH4)2SO4.",

Strawberry prefers NH\u2084 to NO\u2083 nitrogen for optimal growth (Park, 1990). Other studies have shown that the use of ammonium increases the severity of cotton anthracnose (Bollenbacher & Fulton, 1971) and Fusarium crown rot (Woltz et al., 1992) more than the use of nitrate. It was found that, on average, strawberry plants receiving ammonium nitrogen had more disease than those receiving nitrate treatments, although these differences were not significant.",

Additionally, the crop growth and tissue contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in the entire above-ground parts of the plant were investigated. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity, in contrast to phosphorus and calcium. Treatments using either ammonium (NH\u2084) or nitrate (NO\u2083) nitrogen showed no significant difference. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (R\u00b2 = 0.9078) and phosphorus (R\u00b2 = 0.8842), but was not influenced by higher levels of potassium (R\u00b2 = 0.8587) and calcium (R\u00b2 = 0.6526).",
            "Two studies evaluated the effect of seven nitrogen sources, each applied at three levels, on the severity of anthracnose crown rot. In Nitrogen Source Study I, significant differences were observed due to strawberry clone, N source, and N level, along with a notable interaction between N source and N level. 'MSUS 98' plants exhibited lower disease severity ratings compared to 'MSUS 37' or 'MSUS 70' when averaged across all treatments. Plants receiving 160 ppm N had higher disease severity ratings than those receiving 0 ppm N or 40 ppm N. The highest disease severity ratings were recorded for plants treated with 160 ppm of (NH4)2HPO4, (NH4)2SO4, and NH4Cl. Interestingly, plants receiving 160 ppm of Ca(NO3)2 had disease severity ratings comparable to those receiving no nitrogen, despite having leaf nitrogen content as high as any other treatment.",

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

Field studies by Nam et al. (2006) showed that higher levels of nitrogen and potassium increased anthracnose crown rot disease severity compared to phosphorus and calcium. Anthracnose fruit rot was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl2 developed less fruit rot than those from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl2 (Smith and Gupton, 1993)."

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",
            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "Since Colletotrichum spp. may infect many other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields is sometimes assumed to come from these other hosts growing near the strawberry field. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable hosts to strawberries, 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts, were wound-inoculated onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith, 2002).

Greater awareness of the surreptitious fungal dynamics on symptomless plants may also justify changes in currently recommended control strategies. For instance, early fungicide applications might effectively reduce initial inoculum production on developing plants, thereby decreasing subsequent epidemic development on fruit.",

We hypothesized that various weeds growing in and around strawberry fields serve as inoculum sources for this disease.

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops worldwide, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides being responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant issue in strawberry nurseries and fruit production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986). The increase in anthracnose-related losses since the 1980s is likely due to the shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture systems and changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are gaining importance, leading to major economic losses for strawberry growers globally. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",

            "Despite intensive research that has contributed to the understanding of the Colletotrichum genus pathogenic to strawberries, there is still a lack of an accurate inventory of these causal agents. The population and prevalence of strawberry-virulent Colletotrichum species have not been systematically investigated in major producers such as China. To address these gaps, this review aims to summarize the biodiversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries by examining the global discovery history. Subsequently, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries in China was analyzed using available data. Finally, we categorized the host range of the two predominant species responsible for strawberry crown rot. This knowledge has important applications for biosecurity risk management (e.g., proper risk estimation in strawberry seedling trade), accurate diagnosis, and anthracnose control. It further lays the groundwork for systematically managing Colletotrichum genera in agricultural ecosystems, not only for the strawberry industry.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems."

However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",
            "Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.",

Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",

These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017).

Post-penetration biotrophic and necrotrophic growth patterns will also be described. Additionally, intriguing studies involving host specificity and chromosome transfer will be summarized.",

A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...",
            "Conclusions drawn by Hindorf (1973) revealed significant morphometric overlap in conidial size among various Colletotrichum species. Pring et al. (1995) noted that wounding greatly enhances Colletotrichum's ability to cause disease. Oh et al. (1999) emphasized the role of cuticular wax layers in the susceptibility of green and red pepper fruits to infection. They highlighted that differentiation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici was reliable when based on appressorial shape. However, it was challenging to delineate species by appressorial characteristics alone, as a negative correlation was found between cuticle thickness and disease incidence for C. gloeosporioides."

            "Control of Colletotrichum acutatum is highly dependent on frequent applications of both multi-site and single-site fungicides (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). Multi-site fungicides, such as captan, provide satisfactory control of C. acutatum, but they lack a curative effect, necessitating weekly applications throughout the season (Mertely et al. 2017b). Single-site fungicides, particularly the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), exhibit a post-infection effect on anthracnose; however, growers are limited in the number of applications permitted during the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Given the limited QoI applications allowed during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multi-site fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. Nevertheless, to ensure symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have frequently been used in nurseries, resulting in the selection of fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another significant strawberry pathogen (Oliveira et al. 2017).",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "Despite the effectiveness of Prochloraz, it should be thoroughly tested before widespread application in strawberry fruiting fields due to potential resistance or tolerance of C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species. Isolates of C. kahawae, typically highly sensitive to Prochloraz, have demonstrated acquired tolerance in culture. Similarly, isolates of C. acutatum from various hosts, including strawberries, have shown resistance to benzimidazole fungicides compared to C. gloeosporioides isolates.",
            "Finally, it is important to emphasize that strawberry production in Brazil remains heavily dependent on fungicide applications, which are not completely effective for anthracnose control and raise consumer concerns about food safety. Our study indicates that managing flower blight can be quite effective through a combination of cultural choices, which could potentially reduce dependency on chemical controls.",

            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",
            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",
            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",

Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.",

Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010).

Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",

            "A cultivar-by-isolate interaction for resistance has been demonstrated for Colletotrichum acutatum (15). A single dominant gene (Rca2) appears to be responsible for this interaction (16) and distinguishes two groups of C. acutatum: those producing a non-compatible reaction with cultivars having Rca2 (group 2) and those having an intermediate degree of compatibility with cultivars possessing the Rca2 gene (group 1) (15). Although C. acutatum is more distantly related to C. gloeosporioides than to C. fragariae (35) and produces different disease symptoms on strawberry (27), there is evidence that resistance to C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and G. cingulata is correlated (34). Cultivars that are at least moderately resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum examined in the current study include 'Sweet Charlie' (8), 'Carmine' (10), and 'Earlibrite' (C. K. Chandler, unpublished). 'Sweet Charlie' is field immune to fruit rot, whereas 'Carmine' and 'Earlibrite' are moderately resistant. Although the mechanism of resistance to C. acutatum in these cultivars has not been examined, it is likely that they possess at least one copy of a dominant resistance gene against group 2 C. acutatum isolates. A dominant resistance gene to this group of isolates was found in 13 of 14 cultivars from the United States and Europe classified as intermediately susceptible or resistant to anthracnose fruit rot, whereas it occurred in only one of seven cultivars classified as susceptible (16). Additionally, cultivars such as 'Dover', which is homozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), and 'Sequoia', which is heterozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), are present in the pedigrees of the three fruit rot-resistant cultivars used in the current study (9\u201311). With the exception of 'Treasure', no cultivar displayed significantly greater resistance to crown rot than 'Sweet Charlie', 'Earlibrite', and 'Carmine', suggesting that major gene resistance to C. acutatum could also be effective against C. gloeosporioides. The lack of a cultivar-by-isolate interaction observed with isolates of C. gloeosporioides could be due to little variation in a gene product or products in this species that are homologous to those responsible for the interaction with C. acutatum. Also important is the fact that 'Treasure' was found to be highly susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum in field trials conducted over two years (C. K. Chandler, unpublished), indicating that genes responsible for resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides do not necessarily confer resistance to C. acutatum.",

Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",

The results show the varying effectiveness of different Colletotrichum species on the three fruit types, with statistical letters indicating significant differences in lesion size and infection frequency within and between species.",
            "Regarding the species isolated from apples, none appeared to be specific to apple fruits. Based on our pathogenicity data, all of them can potentially infect peach and guava, except for the C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730, which did not infect guava at all. There is no difference in virulence among the three species tested on apple. Colletotrichum nymphaeae was recently identified among strains in the NIAS Genbank from multiple hosts, including several strains from apple and peach in Japan (Sato & Moriwaki, 2013). This species caused lesions on fruits of all three hosts tested and apparently also occurs on all of them in nature. Although C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae have a large host range with some overlapping hosts, there could still be differences in pathogenicity and aggressiveness.",
            "All strains tested formed large lesions on all inoculated peach fruits; however, their infection frequency and lesion size on guava and apple varied. Colletotrichum melonis (Col 20) caused larger lesions on peach than C. paranaense (CBS 134728), C. abscissum (CBS 134727), and C. nymphaeae (CPC 20897). C. abscissum showed no difference in lesion size between peach and guava. This strain infected only one apple, and the lesion size was smaller than those caused by most other strains tested. Colletotrichum melonis strain Col 20 infected all inoculated guava fruits, while C. cf. melonis strain CBS 134730 infected only peach and apple. Additionally, C. nymphaeae strain CPC 20897 formed smaller lesions on guava fruits than C. paranaense strain CBS 134728.",
            "Strain CBS 134727 of C. abscissum grouped with strains causing citrus postbloom fruit drop. This strain was collected from guava fruit with anthracnose in a commercial orchard in Cafel\u00e2ndia. Previous studies revealed its pathogenicity to citrus, causing postbloom fruit drop in 70% of inoculated flowers (Ramiro et al., unpublished data). Guava volatiles repel Diaphorina citri, the vector of citrus Huanglongbing (HLB), making guava intercropping a strategy to control HLB (Beattie et al., 2006). However, the ability of guava to host C. abscissum has significant epidemiological implications for citrus postbloom fruit drop outbreaks. All strains tested for pathogenicity on fruits were able to infect various hosts, though they varied in aggressiveness. Studies have shown a lack of host specificity among Colletotrichum species infecting fruits (Peres et al. 2002; MacKenzie et al. 2009; Lakshmi et al. 2011; Phoulivong et al. 2012; de Souza et al. 2013; Peng et al. 2013; Baroncelli et al. 2015). Many Colletotrichum species associate with different hosts, and one host can be affected by multiple species (Damm et al. 2012, 2014; Weir et al. 2012). In a study by MacKenzie et al. (2009), genetically distinct strains of C. acutatum (s. lat.) from strawberry, blueberry, citrus, and fern exhibited pathogenicity and varied in aggressiveness, with the highest incidence and largest lesions on their original host. Based on TUB2 sequences, Damm et al. (2012) linked the strains from strawberry to others.",

It includes data for several fruit types: strawberries (both cv. Spadona), pears (cv. Hermosa), peaches (cv. Flamekiss), nectarines (cv. Flamekiss), and apples (Golden Delicious and Starking). The table provides a comparative analysis of lesion sizes across these different fruits, showcasing the varying susceptibility to the pathogen. The specific measurements for lesion development on each type of fruit highlight the differences in response to the inoculation, potentially reflecting the host-specific interactions and the aggressiveness of the fungal isolates used.",
            "The filamentous fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (teleomorph = Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk) causes anthracnose disease on various fruits, including peach (Bernstein et al. 1995; Kim and Hong 2008; Ramsey et al. 1951), blueberry (Hartung et al. 1981; Smith et al. 1996), strawberry (Denoyes and Baudry 1995; Freeman et al. 2002; Smith and Black 1990), almond (Ogawa and English 1991), avocado (Stanley et al. 1996), apple (Bernstein et al. 1995; Shi et al. 1996), papaya (Gamagae et al. 2003), and citrus (Alahakoon and Brown 1994; Liyanage et al. 1992). The disease can develop on stems, twigs, leaves, and fruit of host plants. On peach, the pathogen often occurs in areas and during seasons with high rainfall and warm temperatures (Ogawa et al. 1995). Symptoms include sunken lesions with circular rings, where conidia of the fungus are produced in acervuli. Anthracnose disease can occasionally cause yield loss in commercial peach orchards in the southeastern United States, especially during wet and warm summers.",
            "Many inoculation studies have been conducted with Colletotrichum spp., demonstrating that most isolates are relatively non-host-specific. However, relatively few studies have addressed the host specificity of C. acutatum. Bernstein et al. inoculated non-wounded, detached ripe peach fruit with isolates of Colletotrichum spp. from various hosts and found that lesion size was not related to the source of the isolate. Freeman and Shabi inoculated detached nectarine, mango, avocado, almond, and apple fruit with conidial suspensions of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach. All isolates produced lesions on the fruit, but it was necessary to wound the mango fruit to obtain infection. Peres et al. found that a C. acutatum isolate from strawberry produced lesions on wounded, detached fruit of avocado, guava, papaya, mango, and passion fruit, but not on banana. Isolates from strawberry also produced lesions on both wounded and non-wounded fruit of pear, peach, nectarine, and apple. Thus, it appears that C. acutatum has a broad host range, at least among fruit crops, and is relatively nonspecific. However, many of the above studies were conducted in the laboratory using detached and wounded fruit. The movement of C. acutatum from one fruit crop to another under natural conditions has not been demonstrated, and molecular groups often seem to be host-specific.",
            "In terms of virulence, anthracnose symptoms can vary among different fruits based on factors such as the variety of the fruit, inoculum concentration, humidity, and temperature. Furthermore, pathogenic variation among Colletotrichum species infecting fruit crops has been documented. The diverse species of Colletotrichum that cause anthracnose in fruit crops also pose quarantine concerns. Fruits such as banana, papaya, mango, dragon fruit, guava, and avocado are exported and imported worldwide, and latent infections are a key part of the disease cycle for anthracnose pathogens. This raises the possibility of these pathogens being distributed to new areas or regions.",
            "Colletotrichum species tested, with the exception of C. acutatum, developed lesions on fruits, indicating a cross-infection potential among multiple species affecting two clones of citrus. Notably, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was the most aggressive species, causing typical brown lesions that affected both the skin and albedo tissues. Although C. karstii showed the lowest aggressiveness, it still demonstrated the ability to cause lesions, as did other species, including C. catinaense, C. helleniense, C. hystricis, C. limonicola, and C. novae-zelandiae. The clone \u2018Tarocco Scir\u00e8\u2019 was more susceptible than \u2018Tarocco Nucellare\u2019, aligning with findings from Aiello et al. (2015) regarding C. gloeosporioides and C. karstii.",
            "Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally."

            "In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.",

            "The role of alternative hosts in the disease cycles caused by C. acutatum is also not well understood. The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.",
            "The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field. This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2-3 days at 25\u00b0C to 6-17 days at 5\u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C, the latent period for C. acutatum was shorter than that for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species were similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may significantly contribute to inoculum sources for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may help maintain inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness durations than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves exposed to flower extracts than those exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), indicating that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may rise during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally decreased with increased plant density, concluding that higher density reduces rain penetration into the canopy and thus splash dispersal. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied splash dispersal of conidia from three Colletotrichum spp. and discovered that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while C. acutatum conidia traveled the farthest, likely due to a higher spore production on infected fruit. Colletotrichum acutatum conidia can survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but both conidia and sclerotia die quickly in moist conditions when soil moisture exceeds 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar.

Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "Dispersal of C. acutatum typically occurs through conidia produced in acervuli on host tissue, which are usually rain-splash dispersed. On low-growing crops like strawberry, conidia are spread over short distances, and the use of straw as ground cover can significantly reduce dispersal. In tree crops, dispersal by wind-blown rain can occur over much greater distances. With repeated cycles of infection on sweet orange flowers, post-bloom fruit drop of citrus can spread over large areas in a single season. On citrus, environmental factors, amounts of inoculum, and other factors affecting the epidemiology of post-bloom fruit drop have been used to develop models to predict disease and forecast the need for fungicide applications.",

Previous studies of C. acutatum have characterized the physical aspects of dispersal from single-drop impacts and simulated rain over experimental areas, quantifying the effects of surface topography and plant density on dispersal and disease spread. Recently, Madden et al. characterized the relationship between rain intensity and splash dispersal of C. acutatum across a wide range of intensities.

            "This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.",
            "Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.",
            "Discussion: The spread of anthracnose fruit rot was observed in strawberry plots over two years by determining disease gradients in relation to the distance from introduced point sources of Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum. Disease spread was strongly influenced by the canopy, as evidenced by the significant effect of canopy row side (relative to the inoculum source) and plant density treatment on the height and steepness of the disease gradients. The near side overall exhibited a higher disease incidence than the far row side, and there was generally a negative but nonlinear relationship between plant density and disease incidence."

            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",
            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).",
            "Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).",
            "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a serious disease affecting strawberries. The etiology of anthracnose in strawberries is complex, with several Colletotrichum species identified as causal agents. In this study, multilocus phylogenetic analysis (utilizing genes such as actin, \u03b2-tubulin, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) revealed that 100 isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of strawberry in central China belong to five species. Specifically, 97 isolates were identified as belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, with the distribution as follows: C. murrayae (81%), C. gloeosporioides (8%), C. fructicola (4%), and C. aenigma (4%). Additionally, three isolates from the C. acutatum complex were identified as C. nymphaeae.",
            "A significant effort has been dedicated to identifying which species of Colletotrichum are involved in various anthracnose-type diseases of plants and developing tools for their identification and differentiation. Multiple hosts can be affected by a single species, while multiple species can impact a single host. Simmonds was the first to describe C. acutatum as a new species, distinct from others.",
            "However, clade-based calibration can also provide advantages. Anthracnose diseases are often attributed to several Colletotrichum species within the same clade, depending on the region. For example, the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are found in the acutatum clade, with C. godetiae being dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia; C. nymphaeae prevalent in Portugal; and C. oriniae predominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). Furthermore, accurate identification of Colletotrichum species necessitates molecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Damm et al., 2014). Since species within the same clade often exhibit similar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a clade-based calibration may help address knowledge gaps regarding individual Colletotrichum species, facilitate practical model usage when species identification is challenging due to capacity or economic limitations, and enable predictions across a diverse range of hosts and climatic conditions.",
            "In this research, we developed a general, weather-driven, mechanistic model for predicting anthracnose diseases caused by Colletotrichum spp. on the aerial parts of different host plants in the field. Previous models for anthracnose diseases were species- and crop-specific and considered only one component of the pathogen life cycle, mainly conidial infection (Dodd et al., 1991; Park et al., 1992; Monroe et al., 1997; Moral et al., 2012; Singh, 2020). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first time that such a model has been developed, calibrated for different clades and host plants, and evaluated to make predictions of anthracnose patterns across multiple crops.",
            "Accurate identification of species is essential for effective management of anthracnose disease. Currently, three Colletotrichum species\u2014C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides\u2014have been reported to cause anthracnose in mango. However, the C. gloeosporioides species complex, which consists of ubiquitous fungal pathogens in tropical and subtropical regions, has not been documented in Thailand. The host association and morphological characteristics traditionally used to identify Colletotrichum species are insufficient for distinguishing these pathogens at the species level due to the limited number of morphological traits and the lack of host specificity.",

            "Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification."

            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended.

Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",

Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.",
            "Control of Colletotrichum acutatum is highly dependent on frequent applications of both multi-site and single-site fungicides (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). Multi-site fungicides, such as captan, provide satisfactory control of C. acutatum, but they lack a curative effect, necessitating weekly applications throughout the season (Mertely et al. 2017b). Single-site fungicides, particularly the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), exhibit a post-infection effect on anthracnose; however, growers are limited in the number of applications permitted during the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Given the limited QoI applications allowed during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multi-site fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. Nevertheless, to ensure symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have frequently been used in nurseries, resulting in the selection of fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another significant strawberry pathogen (Oliveira et al. 2017).",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",

Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel.

Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.",
            "Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).",
            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "Since Colletotrichum spp. may infect many other hosts, primary infection in strawberry fields is sometimes assumed to come from these other hosts growing near the strawberry field. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable hosts to strawberries, 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts, were wound-inoculated onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith, 2002). Colletotrichum fragariae isolates...",
            "As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.",
            "Our evidence suggests that Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum can survive and multiply on symptomless strawberry leaves, and that the production of secondary conidia may increase inoculum when susceptible tissue is not available. Greater awareness of the surreptitious fungal dynamics on symptomless plants may also justify changes in currently recommended control strategies. For instance, early fungicide applications might effectively reduce initial inoculum production on developing plants, thereby decreasing subsequent epidemic development on fruit.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum s. str. causes diseases in a wide range of unrelated plants, some of which are economically significant, including Carica papaya, strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), pine (Pinus spp.), Hakea spp., and rooibos (Aspalathus linearis). Two of these are associated with formae speciales, which are not recognized as a taxonomic rank in the International Code of Nomenclature for Algae, Fungi, and Plants (ICN), as they are based on fungus/plant interactions rather than single species. Consequently, formal ICN-compliant taxa cannot use formae speciales as basionyms for new combinations."

While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable. Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti, and some others.",

The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death.

Isolates of these species have not been identified on strawberries in the UK. The variability observed within the UK populations of C. acutatum sensu lato aligns, in part, with previous reports of C. acutatum on strawberries in specific geographic regions. For instance, in countries such as France, Israel, Bulgaria, and Spain, most strawberry anthracnose pathogen isolates clustered into the same species, C. nymphaeae, with minimal intra-specific diversity observed within each country. In contrast, Belgian isolates exhibited a different composition: 33% belonged to C. nymphaeae, 5% to C. fioriniae, 50% to C. godetiae, 3% to C. acutatum sensu stricto, and 6% to C. salicis.

This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. (Milholland, 1981; Gupton and Smith, 1991) is one of the most important factors limiting strawberry production in many southeastern regions (Horn et al., 1972; Smith and Black, 1985; 1987, 1990).",
            "For the past two decades, the causal agent of anthracnose affecting strawberries in Korea was believed to be Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. However, recent molecular analyses have indicated that the genus Colletotrichum has undergone significant taxonomic revisions, introducing several new species. Consequently, it has been revealed that C. gloeosporioides comprises more than 20 distinct species. Therefore, the Korean pathogen isolated from strawberries needs reclassification. The shape and size of the conidia of the pathogen were not significantly different from those of C. gloeosporioides and C. fructicola, but they did differ in the shape of the appressoria. A combined sequence analysis of partial actin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase genes, and the internal transcribed spacer regions indicated that the strawberry isolates formed a monophyletic group with authentic strains of C. fructicola. Based on these results, the anthracnose fungi associated with domestic strawberries in Korea were identified as C. fructicola, distinguishing them from C. gloeosporioides.",
            "In the early 1980s, anthracnose became a significant disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States. In response, the USDA-ARS established a breeding program to develop anthracnose-resistant cultivars suited to the strawberry-growing regions of this area. This initiative was conducted at the Small Fruit Research Station in Poplarville, MS, and the Fruit Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, in collaboration with state experiment stations in Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina (Galletta et al., 1997; Smith and Spiers, 1982)."

As anticipated, foliar N levels increased with higher treatment N levels, while P and K levels did not influence foliar N.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",

Breeding for genetic resistance to anthracnose and the development of resistant cultivars are primary means for reducing economic losses due to this disease. This approach is environmentally sound because it results in reduced fungicide use. As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Simultaneously, the development of more effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses due to both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.

            "In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "The application of nitrogen (N) in the form of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) significantly reduced the severity of anthracnose crown rot in strawberries. In contrast, the levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in fertilizers did not have a similar effect. Plants receiving N as Ca(NO3)2 exhibited fewer symptoms of anthracnose crown rot compared to those receiving N in ammonium form. Although these trials were conducted with potted plants in a greenhouse, the findings are applicable to strawberries grown in sandy soils, typical of Florida.",
            "Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions."

The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.",

            "Over the past decade, genome sequencing has become an efficient and potent means to investigate a broad array of biological systems, from large-scale studies of biological diversity to tracking the evolution and origin of pathogenic microbes. The numerous steps required to glean interpretable and actionable results from raw sequence data invariably require comparative analysis of molecular sequences to discover functional and adaptive genome differences. The Molecular Evolutionary Genetics Analysis (MEGA) software provides tools to conduct such analyses. MEGA includes a large repertoire of programs for assembling sequence alignments, inferring evolutionary trees, estimating genetic distances and diversities, inferring ancestral sequences, computing timetrees, and testing selection. Over the last 25 years, MEGA's use in evolutionary analysis has been cited in over one hundred thousand studies in diverse biological fields."

            "Filamentous fungi of the genus Colletotrichum and its teleomorph Glomerella are considered major plant pathogens worldwide. They cause significant economic damage to crops in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions. Cereals, legumes, ornamentals, vegetables, and fruit trees may be seriously affected by these pathogens. Although many cultivated fruit crops are infected by Colletotrichum species, the most significant economic losses occur when the fruiting stage is attacked. Colletotrichum species cause typical disease symptoms known as anthracnose, characterized by sunken necrotic tissue where orange conidial masses are produced. Anthracnose diseases can appear in both developing and mature plant tissues.",
            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",
            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",
            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect.

            "Multiple sequence alignment (MSA) plays a crucial role in the evolutionary analysis of biological sequences. MAFFT is an MSA program first released in 2002 (Katoh et al. 2002). Due to its high performance (Nuin et al. 2006; Golubchik et al. 2007; Dessimoz and Gil 2010; Letsch et al. 2010; Sahraeian and Yoon 2011; Sievers et al. 2011), MAFFT has gained popularity in recent years. Following the review of the previous version (version 6) by Katoh and Toh (2008b), we have continuously enhanced its accuracy, speed, and utility in practical applications. These improvements and techniques have been documented in various papers (Katoh et al. 2009; Katoh and Toh 2010; Katoh and Frith 2012; Katoh and Standley 2013).",
            "All options in MAFFT assume that the input sequences are homologous, meaning they are derived from a common ancestor during evolution. Consequently, all characters in the input data are aligned. The software does not account for genomic rearrangements or domain shuffling, ensuring that the order of characters in each sequence is preserved, although sequences can be reordered based on similarity. Most MAFFT options presume that nearly all pairs in the input sequences can be aligned, either locally or globally, which introduces a tradeoff between accuracy and speed. For instance, the PartTree option (Katoh and Toh 2007) is a quick but less precise method, while L-INS-i and G-INS-i are slower yet more accurate. RNA structural alignment methods are typically more accurate but computationally more demanding due to additional calculations required.",

MAFFT has a subprogram, mafft-profile, to align two existing alignments. This method separately converts the first alignment (alignment1) and the second alignment (alignment2) into profiles and then aligns the two profiles. This means that the two input alignments are assumed to be phylogenetically isolated from each other, as shown in Figure 1A.

However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "The experimental fungicide pydiflumetofen was not effective against C. acutatum in our in vitro and field studies. However, this fungicide is very active against B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew in strawberries (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "ABSTRACT: Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae, is a serious problem in the southeastern United States, resulting in significant losses in strawberry nurseries. Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.",
            "In summary, while captafol demonstrated fungicidal activity against strawberry anthracnose, other fungicides like benomyl and maneb have shown reduced effectiveness in recent years, necessitating the ongoing evaluation of control strategies for this pervasive disease.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance."

(2006), strains of this species cluster with C. acutatum and C. lupini. Morphological and cultural differences revealed C. phormii as a distinct lineage, which we have confirmed in our study. Colletotrichum phormii can be distinguished from the closely related C. salicis (and indeed from all other species in the C. acutatum complex) by its elongate, large conidia and large appressoria. The species appears to be host-specific to Phormium spp. Recently, Takeuchi & Hori (2006) reported C. gloeosporioides from Phormium in Japan. However, based on dimensions of conidia (10\u201316.5 \u00d7 4\u20136 \u00b5m) and appressoria (7\u201317 \u00d7 4\u201311.5 \u00b5m) and the shape of the conidia\u2014cylindrical with broadly rounded ends (see fig. 3 of that paper)\u2014the fungus seems to belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex rather than one of the two C. acutatum complex members from Phormium treated in this study.",

However, recent multigene phylogenetic analyses have revealed that C. acutatum is a species complex (the acutatum complex) consisting of 34 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with seven species identified as responsible for anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Similarly, C. gloeosporioides has been found to be a complex of 38 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with nine species identified as pathogens of chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018).

In Korea, they are classified as C. gloeosporioides (perfect stage: G. cingulata) (Kim et al., 1992; Nam et al., 1998). Three anthracnose strains (KACC 40695, KACC 40696, and KACC 40812) stored in the Korean Agricultural Culture Collection (KACC) were identified as C. gloeosporioides based on ITS and partial \u03b2-tubulin gene sequence analysis, as well as cultural characteristics (Kim et al., 2006).",

Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",

Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

Notably, there was a significant variation in foliar N levels among different strawberry clones, suggesting that N applications should be customized for each cultivar. Nonetheless, the trend of decreased anthracnose severity with nitrate fertilizers was consistent across five strawberry clones tested, indicating that other cultivars may respond similarly.",
            "Additionally, prior studies have indicated correlations between nitrogen concentration and anthracnose severity, similar to findings in cotton (Huber & Watson, 1974). Choi et al. (2000) noted that as tissue nitrogen content decreased, calcium and manganese contents, which directly impact phenolic metabolism, increased in strawberries. Manganese may enhance the synthesis of host defense products, potentially reducing disease incidence and severity. Phosphorus supplied as phosphite effectively reduced phytophthora root and crown rot in tomato and pepper plants, while calcium has been shown to inhibit anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Froster et al., 1998)."

This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...",
            "The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.",

These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017).

            "C. acutatum and C. fragariae underwent a very brief biotrophic phase (less than 12 hours) before entering their extended necrotrophic phase. Representatives of both species were observed entering living host cells and developing a matrix comparable to that described in reported biotrophic systems, but they killed the host cells within a few hours. Previous descriptions for other Colletotrichum species cite biotrophy at a minimum of \u201cless than 24 hours.\u201d However, a situation in which a living cell is entered and quickly killed might be considered a modification of necrotrophy rather than biotrophy or hemibiotrophy.",
            "Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries. A detailed consideration of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the context of strawberry anthracnose are crucial for understanding these dynamics.",

Understanding the detailed natures of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for grasping the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is a condition where the fungus keeps host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them. Necrotrophy refers to the approach of living host cells, killing them before entering their lumina. Hemibiotrophy describes a phase where the fungus initially enters a biotrophic state and then transitions to a necrotrophic phase. The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen are critical for understanding these dynamics.",
            "Although C. acutatum usually produces necrotic symptoms of various types on most hosts, the host\u2013pathogen interaction appears to be more biotrophic compared to some other species, such as C. gloeosporioides. C. acutatum survives and competes poorly as a saprophyte in most cases. Nevertheless, it has been isolated from many plant species and is not always associated with disease. This species may colonize the surface of plant tissues as an epiphyte or endophyte under certain circumstances, on both hosts and non-hosts, without producing symptoms.",

            "Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating anthracnose diseases and their causal agents. Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",

            "On strawberry plants, C. acutatum primarily causes black spot disease on the fruit but can also affect crowns, roots, and leaves (Freeman & Katan 1997), making it one of the most serious diseases in commercial fruit production. The conidia are formed in acervuli on the host, while in culture, they can also be produced in the aerial mycelium (Johnston & Jones 1997). C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on living strawberry leaves, stimulated by extracts from the strawberry plant, especially flower extracts (Leandro et al. 2001; Leandro et al. 2003). According to Buddie et al. (1999), secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia, and these are generally smaller and more variable in shape, which can obscure the differences between taxa. Additionally, C. acutatum forms simple pigmented appressoria but has few or no setae (Simmonds 1965).",
            "O\u2019Connell et al. and Perfect et al. described two types of interactions between Colletotrichum species and their hosts: intercellular hemibiotrophy and subcuticular intramural necrotrophy. Regarding C. acutatum, there are few studies on the cytology of the infection process and the nature of early biotrophic relationships or quiescent infections established between the pathogen and host. However, based on studies with C. acutatum on specific hosts, four types of interactions or infection strategies can be described.",
            "Fungal isolates: The 62 isolates of C. acutatum isolated from strawberry were selected from various collections representing a range of isolation dates (1978 to 1998) and geographic regions worldwide. Nineteen C. acutatum isolates from other host plants were included in the study for comparison. Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic. Additionally, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries originating from Europe and the United States, as well as one isolate from mango used as an outgroup, were studied. All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4\u00b0C as described by Perkins. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests. All isolates were identified using classical taxonomic criteria, such as conidial shape and growth on PDA."

            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%.

However, in recent cultivation systems, plants are continuously cultivated on elevated benches to improve production efficiency.

The present study demonstrated that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during the following cultivation season. While there are numerous sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, the increase of pathogens on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.",

However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production. Therefore, it remains unknown whether other Colletotrichum species are similarly affected by moisture.

            "Repetitive DNA elements have proven useful for restriction fragment length polymorphism (RFLP) grouping of various Colletotrichum species. For instance, a repetitive nuclear DNA element (GcpR1), originally identified in the bean anthracnose pathogen C. lindemuthianum, was successfully used to differentiate among 10 species of Colletotrichum, producing unique polymorphic patterns for each species. When GcpR1 was employed to compare C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond and avocado in Israel, the band patterns of the almond isolates were uniform and distinct from those of the avocado isolates. Additionally, polymorphic fragments were observed within the avocado isolates, correlating with the morphological and VCG heterogeneity of this population.",
            "HaeIII RFLPs of A+T-rich DNA were successfully used to characterize Colletotrichum isolates from 10 species, with each representative revealing unique restriction patterns. The results of this approach were similar to those obtained using the GcpR1 repetitive element, where C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond exhibited unique band patterns, in contrast to the polymorphic fragments observed for avocado isolates. This method also facilitated the grouping of C. acutatum isolates from apple and peach, as well as differentiation among C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango.",
            "To categorize strains into different groups, other studies have utilized random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphisms, internal transcribed spacer-restriction fragment length polymorphisms (ITS-RFLP), and classifications based on ITS sequences (Gautam, 2014; Smith, 2008). While RAPD and ITS-RFLP polymorphisms indicate genetic variability among isolates, specific polymorphisms have not yet been linked to particular species. Moreover, classifying strains using a single marker sequence has proven insufficient for distinguishing between different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al., 2012).",
            "Based on morphological characteristics and analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA, Xie et al. (2010) showed that strawberry anthracnose infections in Zhejiang and Shanghai were caused by C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae. However, since this study only analyzed a single region and did not use multiple genes, the results may not be entirely accurate. Indeed, multigene phylogenetic analyses, combined with morphological characteristics, have been used to identify many important pathogens (Cai et al. 2009; Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). The classification and delimitation of Colletotrichum species have been debated (Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum isolates have been successfully identified based on multigene phylogenies and morphological characteristics, indicating that this method is mature and can accurately identify pathogens (Damm et al. 2012). However, morphological characteristics and multigene phylogenies have not yet been used to identify the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in China or to determine the distributions of these species.",
            "In summary, rDNA analysis is a reliable method for taxonomic species identification, while the use of GcpR1 and other repetitive DNA elements, A+T-rich DNA RFLPs, and ap-PCR are valuable methods for assessing subpopulation diversity within species.",
            "rDNA genes exist as multiple copies in the genome. Due to the lesser conservation of sequence, the non-transcribed and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA subunits are suitable for detecting recent evolutionary divergence within Colletotrichum. In our study, limited restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified rDNA were utilized to differentiate representative isolates of C. gloeosporioides from a diverse range of hosts, as well as from rDNA of C. acutatum sourced from strawberry. Species-specific primers have been designed based on the dissimilarities in the sequences of the ITS regions from various Colletotrichum species. We employed such primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. As shown in Figure 5A, a single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range but was absent in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae amplified a specific 450-bp fragment, allowing these two species to be distinguished from C. acutatum. This method also facilitated the differentiation between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus. These findings indicate that rDNA analysis serves as an effective taxonomic tool for species identification and diagnostic pathogen detection in plants, although it may not reveal subpopulations within a species.",
            "Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA (RAPD), or ap-PCR, has been extensively utilized for the identification and characterization of isolates in Colletotrichum. We employed ap-PCR using primers derived from minisatellite or repeat sequences (CAGCAGCAGCAGCAG, TGTCTGTCTGTCTGTC, GACACGACACGACAC, GACAGACAGACAGACA) to compare Colletotrichum species from almond, avocado, strawberry, and other fruits. Unique band patterns were observed among the clonal populations of C. acutatum from strawberry and C. gloeosporioides from almond, while avocado isolates exhibited polymorphisms.",
            "Using markers outside the range of the C. gloeosporioides complex is likely to fail due to their highly variable nature, even in priming sites. For instance, the markers developed by Crouch et al. (2009a) to amplify partial fragments of the Apn2 gene and intergenic regions in the same locus for gramini-colous Colletotrichum species could not be utilized for the isolates analyzed in this study (data not shown). After obtaining homologous sequences from isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex, alignments revealed significant divergence between the two species groups. However, these markers are more suitable than barcode genes for accurately dissecting and unraveling the diversity and evolutionary relationships in a complex of closely related species. Moreover, as Cai et al. (2009) noted, the selection and decision regarding the most suitable barcode gene(s) can only occur during the species delimitation process, as that is when we understand which taxa need to be distinguished. Thus, we first need to fully resolve the C. gloeosporioides complex using a set of highly informative genes before adequately searching for and selecting a barcode gene.",
            "The study utilized specific primers to amplify the ITS1 and ITS2 regions of the nuclear ribosomal DNA, including the 5.8S rDNA, from representative isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides, chosen based on RAPD analysis. The amplification process involved an initial denaturation step at 95\u00b0C for 5 minutes, followed by 40 cycles of denaturation, annealing, and extension at specific temperatures.",
            "The CAL, GAPDH, and TUB2 nucleotide sequences from C. siamense isolates exhibited variability. However, phylogenetic analysis revealed that all isolates from our collection clustered closely around reference isolates of C. siamense (ICMP 17795, ICMP 18642, and ICMP 18121). The observed genetic variability may partly be attributed to the geographic isolation of some distinct genotypes; for instance, the OD isolates were collected 160 km apart from other isolates. Rojas et al. (2010) noted two distinct haplotype subgroups (A4-3 and A5-4) within their species concept of C. ignotum (now known as C. fructicola), a finding later confirmed by Weir et al. (2012). Collectively, these haplotype subgroups were found to be monophyletic within the Musae clade of the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Both clades include isolates from a wide range of hosts across various countries and exhibit similar cultural characteristics and morphology (Weir et al. 2012)."

            "Abstract: Fragaria ananassa (common name: strawberry) is a globally cultivated hybrid species belonging to the Rosaceae family. Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.",
            "For the first time, four European isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from strawberry, which have been rarely observed, were included in a study of genetic polymorphism and pathogenic variability. The RAPD patterns of all 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides showed a high level of polymorphism, as previously described. Because isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry collected in Europe and the United States were closely related genetically, it is possible that the C. gloeosporioides isolates pathogenic on strawberry were also introduced into Europe from North America through plant trade, similar to what has been suggested for C. acutatum. The dissemination of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum through plant exchanges between Europe and the United States, along with genetic and pathogenic variation within both species, could be further investigated using Californian and European isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Results from several studies suggest that Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. In one of these studies (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence of two subgroups within C. acutatum. The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberries and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses. Based on these molecular data, Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberries. Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).",

Similarly, sequencing and restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA) have been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species from strawberries. In populations of C. acutatum and C. fragariae from strawberries, little genomic variation was observed within each species using various molecular methods. In contrast, high diversity was observed in populations of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries, which possess the perfect stage. However, C. acutatum isolated from strawberries in Europe were distinct from American strawberry isolates.

To further understand the in vitro and in planta aggressiveness of different Colletotrichum spp. at various temperatures, multiple representative isolates of each species were tested for mycelial growth rates in an artificial medium, as well as their ability to cause lesions on wounded or non-wounded strawberry leaves. Since population analysis of Colletotrichum spp. causing strawberry anthracnose has only been reported for species from the UK and China (including Anhui, Hainan, Hebei, Hubei, Liaoning, Shandong, and Zhejiang Provinces, as well as Beijing and Shanghai), this study will provide insights into the biology of strawberry anthracnose disease in subtropical regions."

            "Colletotrichum hippeastri: The conidia of Colletotrichum hippeastri overlap in size with those of C. dracaenophilum D.F. Farr & M.E. Palm, C. sansevieriae M. Nakamura & M. Ohzono, and C. nupharicola D.A. Johnson, Carris & J.D. Rogers (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2006). However, C. hippeastri differs in several other characteristics. The conidia of C. hippeastri are typically narrower at each end or in the center, unlike those of C. dracaenophilum and C. nupharicola, which do not exhibit narrowing (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006). Germinating conidia of C. hippeastri can form 2-4 cells (Fig. 4), a feature that distinguishes it from other Colletotrichum species. The conidia of C. nupharicola become 2-celled, and secondary conidia form from germ tubes (Johnson et al., 1997). The appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. nupharicola (10.5-17.5 \u00d7 8-12.5 \u00b5m vs. 6-10 \u00d7 7-9 \u00b5m) and are irregular, crenate, or lobed (Figs. 4H, I, K-N), whereas those of C. nupharicola are ovoid to clavate. Additionally, the conidia of C. hippeastri are longer than those of C. sansevieriae (mean 29.2 \u00d7 8.8 \u00b5m vs. 18.4 \u00d7 6.4 \u00b5m). C. sansevieriae is also highly host-specific to Sansevieria (Nakamura et al., 2006). Colonies of C. hippeastri grow faster than those of C. dracaenophilum, C. sansevieriae, or C. nupharicola, and exhibit other distinct colony characteristics (Johnson et al., 1997; Farr et al., 2006; Nakamura et al., 2006). Due to the very short ITS sequence of C. sansevieriae (159 base pairs in GenBank), these sequences were not included in our ITS phylogenetic analysis. The ITS2 sequences of C. hippeastri and C. sansevieriae (AB212991, strain: Sa-1-2; MAFF239721, ex-holotype) display nineteen base differences. Ultimately, C. hippeastri clusters separately from C. dracaenophilum in phylograms inferred from ITS sequences (Fig. 1).",
            "In the host, conidia are produced in acervuli. In culture, they appear to be formed throughout the mycelium, although massed conidiophores resembling acervuli may occur. The spore masses are salmon-colored and, when formed in culture, are often more or less hidden within the mycelium. Setae have not been observed in association with acervuli, but scattered, poorly developed setae occasionally appear in culture. Conidiophores are slender, typically two to three times the length of the spore and about half the width, though they may also be shorter and stouter. Appressoria are rarely lobed, and the germ pore is often poorly defined. The host range and other characteristics of this species have been discussed in more detail in the preceding pages. Representative dried cultures are deposited in the Herbarium of the Botany Department at the University of Queensland and in the Herbarium of the Commonwealth Mycological Institute, England."

A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.",

Interestingly, spore deposition did not decrease in a straightforward linear manner with rising plant density, and density still influenced deposition between rows even when the inoculum source was outside the canopy. The authors proposed three mechanisms by which density may influence dispersal: (1) reduction in spore removal from the inoculum source due to sheltering, (2) reduction in the resplash of spore-carrying droplets, and (3) direct interception of spores in splash droplets by the plant canopy.

            "Another significant finding from comparative studies is that lifestyle and host preference do not correlate with phylogenetic relationships (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). A comparison of the genomes of the endophyte C. tofieldiae and the closely related pathogen C. incanum indicated that the transition to an endophytic lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the number of predicted effectors and an expansion of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related proteins (Hacquard et al., 2016). In contrast, relatively distantly related members of the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes exhibit remarkably similar repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secreted proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). This observation suggests that these gene families evolved recently and independently in these two phylogenetically separated lineages (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). Further comparative analyses of the genomes within the C. acutatum species complex revealed that necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins were twice as abundant as in the other fungi studied. The large number of these genes underscores their potential significance in the pathogenicity of these species.",

A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...",

However, Johnston & Jones (1997) confirmed it as a member of the C. acutatum complex.

            "Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",
            "Strawberries (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) is a popular small fruit crop known for its high economic and nutritive value, and it is in high demand globally. From 2008 to 2018, the annual worldwide cultivation of strawberries increased from approximately 400 to 483 thousand hectares. Although strawberries are native to temperate regions, they can also be grown in tropical and subtropical regions, sometimes under high-altitude conditions. The land areas devoted to strawberry cultivation in Colombia, Peru, Guatemala, Bolivia, and Taiwan in 2018 were 1,482 ha, 1,453 ha, 690 ha, 522 ha, and 506 ha, respectively.",
            "Although strawberries are considered a minor crop, they provide a significant source of income for many fruit and nursery growers. In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.",

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a significant disease affecting strawberry production. Surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected from affected areas, specifically strawberry nurseries and production fields in six states across the United States. The use of fungicides, particularly quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been widely employed for controlling C. acutatum for the past 20 years. Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group. This situation necessitates immediate changes in anthracnose management strategies to incorporate other chemical and non-chemical approaches, aiming to limit the selection of resistant populations and prevent future outbreaks.",
            "So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide. Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.",
            "ABSTRACT: Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae, is a serious problem in the southeastern United States, resulting in significant losses in strawberry nurseries.

There was a linear increase in logit-transformed fruit disease incidence with wetness duration, with a slope described by a polynomial function of temperature. The optimum temperature for infection was found to be between 25 and 30\u00b0C. Relationships between epidemiological processes (i.e., infection and sporulation) and temperature and/or wetness duration for Colletotrichum species have also been studied with other hosts. For instance, Denham and Waller (6) observed an increase in disease incidence in citrus caused by C. gloeosporioides, correlating with an increase in wetness duration after rain events during flowering periods. They utilized field studies on disease incidence, alongside assessments of flower development, blossom patterns, and climatic data, in their observations. Fitzell et al.

            "Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action. Natural products have also been evaluated as alternative fungicides, offering different modes of action, lower toxicity, and increased efficacy (Abril et al., 2008).",

The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.",

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR."

            "Disentangling species complexes within the Colletotrichum genus presents a significant challenge for taxonomists. Given the global importance of this genus, primarily consisting of plant pathogens, it is critical to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to enhance biosecurity and disease control efforts. Traditional methods of species identification have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues. As stated by Sutton (1992), relying solely on morphology is insufficient for improving the systematics of species complexes like C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Accurate identification of these species is crucial for phytopathology, plant breeding, and biosecurity, yet it has been challenging due to the lack of taxonomically informative characteristics. Much literature exists on Colletotrichum as plant pathogens, albeit often in a broad sense (e.g., Sutton, 1980, 1992), and interested readers should refer to these texts for further information. Three examples will also be discussed later in the paper.",
            "Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al. (1994).",
            "The taxonomy of Colletotrichum is currently unsatisfactory, highlighting the pressing need for a polyphasic approach to identification that accurately reflects the natural classification of species and subspecific taxa within the genus (Sutton, 1992; Cannon et al., 2000). This paper proposes a taxonomic framework for describing Colletotrichum epitypes and new species. This framework utilizes a multi-gene phylogeny based on type specimens, along with well-defined phylogenetic lineages that correlate with recognizable polyphasic characters such as morphology, cultural characteristics, physiology, and pathogenicity. The paper discusses various approaches that have been used or could be incorporated in the study of Colletotrichum species, including recommended methodologies and a discussion on the correlation of characters with phylogenetic types. A phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene (ITS) from specimens, including 42 ex-type strains, is also provided (Fig. 1).",
            "Accepted 20 August 2007. To overcome taxonomic problems associated with traditional identification methods, DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize and resolve the taxonomic complexity of some fungal genera, such as Fusarium (O\u2019Donnell et al., 1998), Pestalotiopsis (Jeewon et al., 2004), and Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005). Cannon et al. (2000) stated that data derived from nucleic acid analyses should provide the most reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, sequence analysis of the ITS regions proved useful in studying the phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum species (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005).",
            "A detailed study of the C. boninense complex has revealed that even recently recognized species of Colletotrichum may obscure extensive molecular variation and may contain multiple taxa with distinct evolutionary origins. The ongoing debate regarding whether these segregate taxa should be classified at the species or infraspecific level (Cannon et al. 2008) remains unresolved. However, recent trends favor recognizing them as independent species. This approach simplifies nomenclature but may limit practical value for applied mycologists and plant pathologists, as the names do not necessarily indicate host specificity or nutritional/biological strategies. Unfortunately, many of these species cannot currently be reliably identified using single diagnostic (barcoding) sequences, making this aspect of their systematics a high priority for future research. On a positive note, there is now significantly more information regarding the phylogenetic components of the C. boninense complex.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "The influence of nitrogen, phosphorus, and potassium on the severity of anthracnose crown rot was evaluated in three greenhouse studies. Strawberry plants were fertilized three times weekly with a modified Hoagland's Nutrient Solution containing the treatments. Eight weeks after treatment applications began, the plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of the causal pathogen, Colletotrichum fragariae. Disease severity was rated 30 days later on a scale from 0 (no symptoms) to 6 (plant dead).",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",

Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010).

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "Grain losses of 10-15% from reduced root absorptive capacity and the death or abortion of tillers may go undetected in the field. Wheat fields severely infected with the take-all fungus may exhibit an uneven appearance in height by heading, with significant levels of infection often going unnoticed (3, 17, 38). Whiteheads\ufffdprematurely ripened, poorly filled, or empty seed heads\ufffdproduced on severely infected plants may be scattered throughout the plant population (Fig. 3) or occur in circular to irregularly shaped areas in the field. With adequate moisture, the heads of prematurely killed plants generally have higher soluble carbohydrate levels and are readily colonized by various saprophytic fungi, resulting in a blackened appearance by harvest time. Yield losses vary by soil type, management practices, and climate in major wheat-producing areas worldwide, with estimates ranging from 1% to 50% of potential yield, translating to 0.2 to 0.5 kg/ha of wheat grain for each 1% of the plant population affected (3, 8, 17). Estimated losses in Indiana over a 10-year period (1972-1981) ranged from 4% to 25% of potential wheat yield (20).",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

            "Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.",

            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",
            "The genus Colletotrichum Corda is one of the most important and destructive plant pathogens globally. Scientifically and economically, Colletotrichum is considered the eighth most significant group of phytopathogenic fungi, capable of attacking over 3,200 species of monocot and dicot plants (Dean et al. 2012; Manire et al. 2002; O'Connell et al. 2012), including numerous crops such as cereals, fruits, vegetables, and ornamentals (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2010; Honger et al. 2016; Huang et al. 2016). Several species of Colletotrichum have been isolated from Juglans regia, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato in Korea, Japan, New Zealand, and South Africa (Chen 2003; Cho and Shin 2004; Crous et al. 2000; Gadgil et al. 2005; Gorter 1977; Kobayashi 2007; Pennycook 1989); Colletotrichum sp. in Mexico (Alvarez 1976); C. gloeosporioides from walnut fruits in Slovenia, which caused spots on green walnut fruits (Juha\u0161ov\u00e1 et al. 2005); Colletotrichum godetiae in Australia (Damm et al. 2012); Colletotrichum acutatum in Australia (Simmonds 1966); and C. acutatum sensu lato (s.l.; geographic origin and pathogenicity unknown) (Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas 2005). In France, Colletotrichum fioriniae, Colletotrichum nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. gloeosporioides s.l. were isolated from walnut leaves, nuts, and buds, and confirmed as pathogens of walnut anthracnose through multigene phylogenetic analysis (Da Lio et al. 2018). In Brazil, C. nymphaeae caused walnut anthracnose (Savian et al. 2019). In China, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato (Chen 2003; Qu et al. 2011), C. acutatum (Liu et al. 1995), C. fioriniae (Zhu et al. 2015), Colletotrichum siamense (Wang et al. 2017), Colletotrichum fructicola (Wang et al. 2018), and Colletotrichum viniferum (He et al. 2019) were isolated from walnut. The pathogens responsible for walnut anthracnose include not only C. gloeosporioides but also C. fructicola and C. siamense (Wang et al. 2017, 2018) in China. C. fioriniae can infect walnut leaves, exhibiting symptoms similar to anthracnose (Zhu et al. 2015).

However, recent multigene phylogenetic analyses have revealed that C. acutatum is a species complex (the acutatum complex) consisting of 34 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with seven species identified as responsible for anthracnose in chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018). Similarly, C. gloeosporioides has been found to be a complex of 38 closely related species (Marin-Felix et al. 2017), with nine species identified as pathogens of chili (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018).

The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods. Furthermore, it has been shown that C. acutatum from strawberry can survive for nine months within plant debris in soil."

            "Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating anthracnose diseases and their causal agents. Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato is a significant pathogen responsible for mango anthracnose globally. In some cases, C. acutatum sensu lato has also been linked to the disease. Phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences reveal that C. gloeosporioides comprises diverse groups or sub-populations, suggesting that other Colletotrichum species may also be associated with mango anthracnose. Studies indicate that Colletotrichum isolates from mango can consist of pathogenically and genetically distinct populations of C. gloeosporioides. According to Ploetz (1999), the C. gloeosporioides population on mango has a restricted host range and is highly virulent solely on mango. Following the phylogenetic analyses of the Colletotrichum genus by Phoulivong et al. (2012) and Weir et al. (2012), several species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes, including C. gloeosporioides, have been associated with mango anthracnose.",

Consequently, the data obtained may not accurately reflect the true causal pathogens. It is now acknowledged that C. gloeosporioides is not the most common anthracnose pathogen affecting tropical fruit crops, as previously believed. Various Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose in tropical fruit crops, presenting significant limitations in the production and marketing of these commodities.",

The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",
            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",
            "Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).",

            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",

            "The pathogen can survive in infected plant debris and soil for at least nine months in the absence of a host (Eastburn and Gubler, 1990; Freeman et al., 2002). In fields that have been fumigated, disease outbreaks are attributed to the planting of infected nursery stock. Transplants that appear healthy may have quiescent infections that activate once conditions are favorable (Debode et al., 2015; Horn and Carver, 1968; Leandro et al., 2001), typically under warm, wet environments (King et al., 1997). Crown infections can cause the entire plant to wilt and die during the early establishment of fruit production fields, especially where overhead irrigation is common (Eastburn and Gubler, 1990). Major anthracnose crown rot outbreaks occurred in California nurseries during the 2000-01 (Daugovish et al., 2009) and 2015-16 (K. Ivors, unpublished) seasons, resulting in significant economic losses.",

Using morphological and cultural characteristics, the species responsible for anthracnose was identified as Colletotrichum acutatum. A reliable semi-selective medium, amended with iprodione and lactic acid, was used to isolate the fungus from infected tissues. Additionally, C. acutatum was isolated from necrotic roots of stunted, chlorotic plants that exhibited no visible symptoms of anthracnose. High levels of the pathogen were quantified from naturally infested field soil and perlite growth substrates in the rhizosphere of diseased plants on the iprodione-amended medium.",

The primary aim of this study was to characterize the species of Colletotrichum responsible for these symptoms and to determine whether anthracnose and root necrosis are caused by the same pathogen or different species. We characterized 147 isolates of Colletotrichum from both typical diseased plants and atypical stunted, chlorotic plants with root necrosis. Vegetative compatibility tests with nitrate nonutilizing (nit) mutants were employed to study the genetic composition of the pathogen population. PCR was used to compare the isolates with each other and with reference strains of the three Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries.",

Nyoho, cultivated under a non-circulation hydroponics system, were assessed after inoculation with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Additionally, the crop growth and tissue contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in the entire above-ground parts of the plant were investigated. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity, in contrast to phosphorus and calcium. Treatments using either ammonium (NH\u2084) or nitrate (NO\u2083) nitrogen showed no significant difference. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (R\u00b2 = 0.9078) and phosphorus (R\u00b2 = 0.8842), but was not influenced by higher levels of potassium (R\u00b2 = 0.8587) and calcium (R\u00b2 = 0.6526).",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",

However, C. nymphaeae has been documented in strawberry plants in Egypt and Argentina. Additionally, cases of anthracnose caused by C. nymphaeae in Korea have been observed in kiwiberries, Japanese plums, and persimmons. Given these findings, it is crucial to investigate whether C. nymphaeae originated from other plants or countries. This study confirms that C. nymphaeae induces AFR in strawberry fruits based on morphological features and molecular phylogenetic analyses.",

            "The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach."

            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",

            "As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses from both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also diminished economic losses due to these diseases. Nevertheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental factors are highly favorable for anthracnose development.",

Changes in cultural practices have led to reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly decreased losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. The introduction of partially resistant cultivars has also helped mitigate economic losses due to these diseases. Nonetheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental conditions are highly conducive to anthracnose development.",
            "In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.",
            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.",
            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum is particularly significant in Europe, where it is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.",
            "Tropical fruit crops are susceptible to infection by Colletotrichum species, which typically cause anthracnose. The anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops is summarized in Figure 1. Infection often occurs in the fields during the flowering and fruiting stages. Various factors, including humidity, temperature, fruit condition, and inoculum concentration, can influence Colletotrichum infection."

In these experiments, isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from temperate fruits caused visually indistinguishable disease symptoms when inoculated on detached peach fruit. Similarly, in artificial inoculations of strawberry plants, C. trifolii isolates were either avirulent or moderately virulent on stolons, whereas one isolate of C. coccodes and additional isolates of C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata exhibited virulence comparable to that of C. fragariae on stolons.",

Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

Micronutrient cations (iron [Fe], zinc [Zn], copper [Cu], and manganese [Mn]) can also be analyzed using dry ashing, but only in plant tissues with low silica content (like legumes). This procedure is based on the work of Chapman and Pratt (1961) with slight modifications.

Critical factors in wet digestion procedures include the selection of the digestion vessel, temperature control, time, the digestion mixture, and final volume. The choice of digestion vessel depends on the elements of interest and the heat source. Time and temperature are interrelated and dependent on the digestion mixture. Wet oxidation employs oxidizing acids such as HNO3-H2SO4-HClO4 (tri-acid mixture) or HNO3-HClO4 (di-acid). The use of HClO4 avoids volatilization losses of P, K, and S and provides a clear solution, while H2SO4 helps complete oxidation.

            "Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan. We hypothesized that various weeds growing in and around strawberry fields serve as inoculum sources for this disease. Additionally, we investigated the effect of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on these weeds.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017). In pathogenicity tests, all C. nymphaeae isolates were able to...",
            "From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops worldwide, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides being responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990).

The increase in anthracnose-related losses since the 1980s is likely due to the shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture systems and changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are gaining importance, leading to major economic losses for strawberry growers globally. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",

However, most of these models are simple, considering only one component of the pathogen life cycle\u2014primarily conidial infection\u2014and focus on a single Colletotrichum species or crop. Furthermore, many of these models have never been validated against independent data (i.e., data not used in model development). In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts. As a result, mechanistic models are considered useful for decision-making in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (De Wolf and Isard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al. (2021) developed and validated a mechanistic, weather-driven model for the ripe rot of grapes caused by Colletotrichum species.",

The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",

In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986). The increase in anthracnose-related losses since the 1980s is likely due to the shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture systems and changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are gaining importance, leading to major economic losses for strawberry growers globally. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",

        "retrieved_context": [
            "The histology of infection by Colletotrichum spp. has been studied thoroughly on several hosts. Conidia germinate either by producing germ tubes and terminal appressoria or by forming sessile appressoria. Appressoria become melanized and develop pores from which host penetration occurs. Two types of infections can develop: (i) intracellular hemibiotrophic, in which infection vesicles or swollen hyphae form within epidermal cells (e.g., on Pinus needles), and (ii) subcuticular, intramural necrotrophic, where cuticular penetration is followed by hyphal proliferation within the cuticle and epidermal cell walls.",
            "Primary inoculum consists of fresh conidia produced in acervuli under favorable conditions of temperature (10 to 30\u00b0C for most clades) and moisture (e.g., wetness periods longer than 6 hours) from overwintered sources throughout the cropping season (Moral and Trapero, 2012; Stensvand et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018). Conidia are splash-dispersed by rain (Denham and Waller, 1981; Chakraborty and Billard, 1995; Madden et al., 1996; Madden, 1997; Guyot et al., 2005; Buirchell et al., 2006), deposited on plant surfaces, and germinate. The germ tubes then produce appressoria, which form infection pegs that penetrate the host cuticle and epidermal cell walls (Perfect et al., 1999). Penetration through stomata or wounds by germ tubes without appressoria formation is rare (Zulqarnain et al., 1996). Infection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after a symptomless biotrophic phase, leading to a necrotic phase in which host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow both intra- and inter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogen has a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), with the switch to the necrotrophic phase occurring only when host tissue and environmental conditions favor the continuation of the infection cycle. Except for a few species that exist entirely as endophytes, most Colletotrichum species develop a necrotrophic stage at some point in their life cycle (Prusky et al., 2013).",
            "This review focuses on current research into the infection process of Colletotrichum species, with an overall emphasis on how signal transduction influences pre-penetration morphogenesis, including conidiation, conidial attachment, conidial germination, germ tube formation, and appressorial differentiation. Post-penetration biotrophic and necrotrophic growth patterns will also be described. Additionally, intriguing studies involving host specificity and chromosome transfer will be summarized.",
            "Appressoria serve as infection and survival structures in Colletotrichum spp. The development of appressoria in this group of fungi is influenced by several factors, including nutrient stress, host surface characteristics, phylloplane microorganisms, temperature, and light intensity. In our study, appressorial production was favored by cooler temperatures and was severely impaired at 35\u00b0C. Similar results have been obtained on agar.",
            "To achieve successful pathogenicity, fungi employ various infection strategies to breach the host cuticle. Some pathogens utilize mechanical means through specialized infection structures, while others penetrate the cuticle directly with the assistance of extracellular cutinase activity. Colletotrichum truncatum, a pathogen of legumes, cereals, grasses, and vegetable crops such as Capsicum species, is an ascomycete that infects its host through direct penetration of the host cuticle. The infection and penetration process is believed to be triggered by cutin-degrading enzymes such as cutinase. Numerous cutinases have been isolated and characterized from different fungi. These enzymes are suggested to play roles in carbon acquisition for saprophytic growth, as well as in fungal penetration and surface adhesion.",
            "Penetration pegs were observed in our studies at the light microscope level but not at the ultrastructural level. The appressoria of C. fragariae observed at the ultrastructural level may have been in the process of forming a penetration peg or may have been arrested just prior to the formation of a penetration peg. Latent or quiescent stages have been observed in fungal infections of fruits, where the mature appressorium often does not produce a peg until the fruit reaches a particular stage of ripeness. This concept has not been sufficiently studied in strawberries for the fungal penetration of stolons, petioles, leaves, or roots. Strawberry petioles are often more resistant to infection by C. fragariae while the plant is fruiting. The development of appressoria in some species ceases with the onset of unfavorable conditions, remains latent, and resumes when conditions become favorable again. The more rapid invasion of host tissue by C. fragariae compared to C. acutatum aligns with previous reports indicating that C. fragariae is more aggressive than C. acutatum in inciting disease symptoms following inoculation.",

            "Host infection begins with the germination of conidia, followed by the formation of appressoria and penetration pegs, which are specialized fungal structures that facilitate penetration into host tissues. In some instances, direct penetration occurs through wounds or natural openings.",
            "The sequence and nature of the infection process, including the initial penetration phase\u2014which may involve a biotrophic or quiescent relationship\u2014and the subsequent development of infection hyphae and colonization of the host varies and is not well understood in most cases. With citrus postbloom fruit drop, the infection strategy on leaves is presumably biotrophic. After the end of the bloom period, conidia germinate to form appressoria, establishing quiescent infections that are likely intracellular (6, 92). The tissues where quiescent infections develop are never colonized, and necrotrophy does not occur on leaves; rather, conidia and secondary conidia are produced following the germination of the appressorium on the surface. However, on flower petals, the pathogen behaves as a necrotroph. For key lime and strawberries, the biotrophic phase is very short. The pathogen produces appressoria, penetrates the host, and forms a subcuticular intramural necrotrophic association almost immediately (16). Curry et al. (16) regarded this strategy as a modification of necrotrophy rather than bio- or hemibiotrophy due to the brief biotrophic phase.",
            "The absence of a significant plant resistance response ensures successful colonization of host tissue and subsequent necrotrophic activities. Bailey et al. (1) described two major invasion strategies: intracellular hemibiotrophic invasion and subcuticular intramural invasion. The early stages of invasion for both strategies include conidial adhesion to the host surface, germination of conidia, production of germ tubes, and penetration of the host cuticle via appressoria. Subcuticular intramural pathogens grow within the cuticle and the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells, killing host cells prior to entering them (necrotrophic phase). In contrast, intracellular hemibiotrophic pathogens invade living cells for a short time, maintaining them apparently for nutritional advantage, before converting to a necrotrophic phase."

            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

Certain organic compounds contribute to cation exchange capacity (CEC). The presence of high concentrations of Ca, especially in the form of gypsum, can interfere with the determination of CEC, which is crucial for soil fertility and mineralogical characterization.

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose.

            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

Conversely, species with a wide host range may be more cosmopolitan and potentially opportunistic pathogens. Koch\u2019s postulates have been applied to confirm the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates. For instance, studies have shown that C. acutatum causes Rhododendron anthracnose, while C. boninense was implicated in leaf infections of Euonymus.

Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",

It is concerning to speculate that global warming may exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, changes in temperature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the specific responses of the disease triangle to these variations (Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2018).

All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990).

This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR."

            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers. However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species."

            "In recent years, genome sequences for 28 species of Colletotrichum have been published, and comparative genomic studies have concentrated on genes associated with pathogenicity (Gan et al., 2013), host specialization (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016), and transitions between biotrophic and necrotrophic lifestyles (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012), as well as between endophytic and parasitic lifestyles (Hacquard et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016). Comparative analyses of secretomes have revealed that most predicted secreted proteins possess enzymatic activity, with many identified as candidate effectors (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016; Sanz-Mart\u00edn et al., 2016). The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012).",

Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

            "Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action. Natural products have also been evaluated as alternative fungicides, offering different modes of action, lower toxicity, and increased efficacy (Abril et al., 2008).",

To develop a semiselective medium suitable for both controlled environments and field samples, a selective marker was necessary. The fungicide benomyl, previously used extensively in leatherleaf fern production, did not control fern anthracnose; thus, C. acutatum was expected to be tolerant to it. Induced resistance to benomyl is believed to arise from a single gene mutation and is easily induced and stable. However, some consider the resistance of C. acutatum to benomyl to be natural rather than the result of selection pressure.

            "Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions (Cannon et al. 2012). The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight major plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three species or species complexes of Colletotrichum have been reported to cause anthracnose in strawberries: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae have narrower host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a few C. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al. 2016).",
            "Pathogenicity tests conducted using three species of Colletotrichum isolates demonstrated that all species were pathogenic to mango leaves and fruits during wound-inoculation studies. The symptoms exhibited varied significantly based on factors such as fruit variety, environmental conditions (humidity and temperature), and inoculum concentration (Freeman et al. 1998). Consequently, the findings of this study may not fully capture the virulence potential of these species. Further research is recommended to explore the virulence of Colletotrichum species under field conditions with natural inoculum, rather than relying solely on in vitro artificial inoculation.",
            "Morphological data is now recommended as an alternative method for accurate species identification in the genus Colletotrichum. Species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. amagnum, C. aorchidearum, C. boninense, C. dracae- nophilum, and C. gloeosporioides have been separated into various species using morphological and molecular techniques. However, in China, the identification of Colletotrichum species on mango has primarily relied on conidial morphology and ITS sequences. The combined data are still limited and insufficient to distinguish closely related taxa within the aforementioned species complexes. Previous research concerning Colletotrichum species on mango has mostly involved samples from small, fragmented provincial areas, resulting in poor representation of the actual species diversity in the vast mango-growing regions of China.",
            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.",

            "Additionally, we review the clinical aspects of the genus and the use of Colletotrichum species in biotransformations. We emphasize the importance of accurate identification, achievable through comparisons with type specimens and molecular data. We propose the need for consensus on protocols for the description and naming of Colletotrichum species and make predictions for developments in the next five years. This review highlights the critical need for correct strain identification prior to commencing scholarly research."

            "Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato, along with C. salicis and C. miyabeana, is commonly found on strawberries in Oceania but has only been sporadically detected in Europe. Isolates of these species have not been identified on strawberries in the UK. The variability observed within the UK populations of C. acutatum sensu lato aligns, in part, with previous reports of C. acutatum on strawberries in specific geographic regions. For instance, in countries such as France, Israel, Bulgaria, and Spain, most strawberry anthracnose pathogen isolates clustered into the same species, C. nymphaeae, with minimal intra-specific diversity observed within each country. In contrast, Belgian isolates exhibited a different composition: 33% belonged to C. nymphaeae, 5% to C. fioriniae, 50% to C. godetiae, 3% to C. acutatum sensu stricto, and 6% to C. salicis. The C. acutatum sensu lato status in the UK may stem from a recent introduction in the late 1970s from a limited number of sources. The reasons behind the varying occurrences of different Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry production across geographic locations remain unclear; however, the sources of imported planting materials and local trade practices are heavily implicated.",
            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",
            "The results from this study, along with previous research, may explain the increasing significance of C. acutatum in northern regions (15, 20). Once introduced in an area, C. acutatum could possess distinct advantages over other strawberry-infecting species of Colletotrichum at cooler temperatures, which are typical for northern climates. Two of these advantages include a shorter latent period for C. acutatum and a greater production of spores at lower temperatures.",
            "Representative isolates (highlighted with asterisks in Table 1) of each C. acutatum s.l. group isolated from strawberries in the UK, along with reference isolates from other hosts, were used for pathogenicity tests on the generally susceptible strawberry cultivar Elsanta. A conidial suspension was prepared for each isolate by flooding 10-day-old PDA culture plates with sterile deionized water. The spore concentration was adjusted to 10^5 spores/ml for fruit inoculation and 10^6 spores/ml for crown inoculation.",
            "A significant milestone occurred with the separation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides, when the former was identified as the causal agent of strawberry fruit rot in Australia (Simmonds 1965). In the 1980s, it was suggested that C. gloeosporioides was synonymous with C. fragariae in strawberries (Howard 1983; Smith and Black 1987). Although many pathologists attempted to differentiate among C. fragariae, C. gloeosporioides, and C. acutatum (Smith and Black 1990; Gunnell and Gubler 1992), morphological distinctions remained ambiguous.",
            "This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.",

Results indicate at least one representative clonal population, suggesting a single source of origin, and indicate that the disease spreads through infected propagation material.

Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic. Additionally, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries originating from Europe and the United States, as well as one isolate from mango used as an outgroup, were studied. All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4\u00b0C as described by Perkins. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests.

            "Abstract: Although hydroponic techniques enable intensive and effective crop management, controlling watering for each crop type and growth stage is challenging with commonly used timed watering systems. This often results in excessive or insufficient watering. Hydroponic technology that considers drainage rates can minimize drainage amounts, thereby reducing environmental pollution and fertilizer consumption. This study compared drainage rates and timed watering methods in a strawberry hydroponic system to determine the optimal drainage rate. As the drainage rate increased, the amount of water supplied also increased. A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. The drainage electrical conductivity (EC) level was highest in the 10% drainage rate group. In the 20% drainage rate treatment, leaf length and width increased compared to the four applications of the timer-supplying method. The yield of fruits weighing more than 27 g was highest in the 20% drainage rate treatment, indicating it was the most appropriate. We propose that it is possible to reduce unnecessary fertilizer consumption and increase productivity by managing water supply through drainage rates for precise water supply management in strawberries.",

However, in recent cultivation systems, plants are continuously cultivated on elevated benches to improve production efficiency. This continuous cropping system usually increases weed populations and necessitates intensive herbicide applications, which can also enhance the risk of disease dissemination from weeds to strawberries. The present study demonstrated that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during the following cultivation season. While there are numerous sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, the increase of pathogens on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.",

A notable feature of C. cymbidiicola is the considerable difference in size and shape of the ascospores and conidia when grown on Anthriscus stem compared to cultures on SNA. Colletotrichum oncidii did not produce a teleomorph under the given culture conditions, and its conidia are longer in relation to their width when grown on Anthriscus stem compared to SNA cultures, though the difference is less pronounced.

It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades.

The new combination C. phyllanthi was established, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and renamed as C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening, which may extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, and conidia featuring a prominent basal scar.

            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production.

Bayesian inference has significant advantages over other analysis methods, such as maximum likelihood and maximum parsimony (Archibald et al. 2003), as it provides measures of clade support in the form of posterior probabilities instead of random resampling bootstraps. jModelTest v. 0.1.1 (Posada 2008) was utilized to conduct statistical selection of the best-fit models of nucleotide substitution using the corrected Akaike information criteria (AICc) (see Table 3). Initial analyses indicated that individual genes were broadly congruent, thus nucleotide alignments of all genes were concatenated using Geneious, and separate partitions were created for each gene with its own model of nucleotide substitution. Analyses of the full dataset were run twice for 5 x 10^7 generations and twice for 2 x 10^7 generations for the clade trees. Samples were taken from the posterior every 1000 generations. Convergence of all parameters was checked using internal diagnostics of the standard deviation of split frequencies and performance scale reduction factors (PSRF), as well as externally with Tracer v. 1.5 (Rambaut & Drummond 2007).

More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.",
            "During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017). In pathogenicity tests, all C. nymphaeae isolates were able to...",
            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).",

Panel (c) illustrates black necrotic leaf spots, while panel (d) highlights withering and girdling on a runner. Panel (e) displays the fungal colony's initial white coloration, which later becomes light gray on the upper side. Finally, panel (f) shows conidia that are hyaline, oblong to cylindrical, with rounded obtuse ends, with a scale bar indicating a size of 10 \u03bcm.",
            "Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).",

Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",

Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",

In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon.

Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised.

Single-site fungicides, particularly the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), exhibit a post-infection effect on anthracnose; however, growers are limited in the number of applications permitted during the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Given the limited QoI applications allowed during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multi-site fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. Nevertheless, to ensure symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have frequently been used in nurseries, resulting in the selection of fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another significant strawberry pathogen (Oliveira et al. 2017)."

            "The taxonomy of Colletotrichum is currently unsatisfactory, highlighting the pressing need for a polyphasic approach to identification that accurately reflects the natural classification of species and subspecific taxa within the genus (Sutton, 1992; Cannon et al., 2000). This paper proposes a taxonomic framework for describing Colletotrichum epitypes and new species. This framework utilizes a multi-gene phylogeny based on type specimens, along with well-defined phylogenetic lineages that correlate with recognizable polyphasic characters such as morphology, cultural characteristics, physiology, and pathogenicity. The paper discusses various approaches that have been used or could be incorporated in the study of Colletotrichum species, including recommended methodologies and a discussion on the correlation of characters with phylogenetic types. A phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene (ITS) from specimens, including 42 ex-type strains, is also provided (Fig. 1).",
            "The sequences of eleven strains from strawberry, along with the ex-type or authentic strains of anthracnose available from GenBank (refer to Table 3), were used in this study. Genomic DNA was extracted following the method described by Park et al. (2005). For the amplification of the ITS, partial actin (ACT), and GAPDH genes, three different primer sets were employed: ITS5 and ITS4 (White et al., 1990); ACT512F and ACT783R (Prihastuti et al., 2009); and GDF1 and GDR1 (Peres et al., 2008). Amplification was performed using Maxime polymerase chain reaction (PCR) PreMix (I-Taq, iNtRoN BioTechnology, Korea) in a final volume of 20 \u00b5l, containing 10 pmol of each primer set. PCR conditions were conducted as described by Prihastuti et al. (2009). PCR products were electrophoresed through a 1% agarose gel stained with ethidium bromide and purified using a PCR quick-spin product purification kit (iNtRON BioTechnology, Korea) according to the manufacturer's instructions. Nucleotide sequences were determined by Bioneer Corporation (Chungwon, Korea). The sequences were proofread, edited, and merged with comparable sequences using the PHYDIT program version 3.2 (Chun, 1995). To determine the phylogenetic positions of the Colletotrichum isolates, the alignments of the three gene sequences of 11 Korean isolates and 34 reference sequences retrieved from GenBank were performed with Clustal 1.81 (Thompson et al., 1997). Nucleotide sequences were aligned manually where necessary. A maximum likelihood tree was inferred in MEGA v. 5.05, using TN93+I, which was selected as the most suitable nucleotide model by Modeltest (Tamura et al., 2011). Bootstrap analysis was performed with 1,000 replications to assess branch stability. Sequences of the ITS, ACT, and GAPDH regions of three isolates (CGF080901, CGF090501, and CGF100713) were deposited in GenBank (JX125050, JX125051, and JX125052; KC283023, KC283024, and KC283025; KC283017, KC283018, and KC283019, respectively).",
            "A phylogenetic tree based on ITS sequence data includes sequences from 42 ex-type or ex-epitype cultures, providing a backbone tree for further diagnosis within Colletotrichum. Taxon names, GenBank accession numbers, culture collection numbers, hosts, and the origins of the strains are summarized in Table 1. The analysis followed the methodologies outlined by Cai et al. (2008, 2009). This backbone tree can serve as a rough identification guide for Colletotrichum species.",
            "Sequences were edited and assembled using DNAMAN (version 5.2.2; Lynnon Biosoft) to produce consensus sequences that were compared by BLAST (Altschul et al. 1990) against the NCBI non-redundant database. Sequences from extype or ex-epitype isolates of Colletotrichum species from GenBank were selected for use in the phylogenetic analyses. Sequence alignments of each gene and combined genes were made with ClustalX version 1.83. Phylogenetic trees were constructed with MEGA4 software version 4.0 using the maximum parsimony method.",
            "Figure 4. The maximum likelihood tree based on the concatenated dataset of ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 sequences from a total of 81 Colletotrichum species, with ex-type and epitype strains retrieved from GenBank. Numbers on the nodes are bootstrap values (left) and posterior probabilities (right). Colletotrichum isolates from this study are shown in red. The scale bar indicates the number of substitutions per site.",
            "The incongruence length difference (ILD) test indicated that the ACT, CHS-1, ITS, and TUB2 markers were homogeneous. Consequently, concatenated sequences of these four markers were utilized to generate a phylogenetic tree comprising a total of 81 isolates, including 44 ex-type and epitype strains. The topology of the maximum likelihood (ML) tree was consistent with that of the Bayesian tree; therefore, only the ML tree is presented (Figure 4). Among the 37 isolates, ten clustered with C. asianum strains (ICMP 18580, ICMP 18696, NN8, WM52, and NN19) showing a posterior probability of 0.97 and bootstrap values of 99%. Three isolates formed a clade with C. siamense strains (ICMP 18578, ICMP 17795, ICMP 18121, ICMP 12567, and ICMP 18574) with a posterior probability of 0.97 and bootstrap values of 77%. Nineteen isolates clustered with the C. gloeosporioides strain (ICMP 17821) with a posterior probability of 1.00 and bootstrap values of 99%. Five isolates were clustered with C. acutatum (CBS 112996, IMI 223120, IMI 216370, CBS 144.29, and CBS 979.69) showing a posterior probability of 0.85 and bootstrap values of 99%.",
            "How can this situation be rectified? Isolates that represent the type species are needed. Published new species must have ex-type living strains deposited in easily accessible culture collections for future research. In some cases, such as C. boninense and C. kahawae, living types are available; however, in most cases, they are not. Epitypification is necessary in certain situations, such as when the type specimen of the taxon no longer exists, is in poor condition, is of ambiguous status, or has deteriorated so that many important features are not available for further studies (Shenoy et al., 2007; Cannon et al., 2008; Hyde and Zhang, 2008; Than et al., 2008). Epitypification can resolve many taxonomic problems and stabilize the understanding of species, genera, families, or orders (Phillips et al., 2007; Shenoy et al., 2007; Than et al., 2008; Cannon et al., 2008; Hyde and Zhang, 2008). The epitypification of Colletotrichum species began in 2007, and currently, 42 species have been epitypified or have living cultures (Hyde et al., 2009).",
            "In the current study, over 50 strains belonging to this species were identified, isolated from various host plants primarily in temperate zones. Evidence of heterogeneity within the species is noted, as two subclades are apparent in the phylogenetic analysis; however, neither bootstrap support nor Bayesian probability values are high enough to warrant their recognition at the species level. Additionally, strains from major hosts and countries are distributed throughout the clade.",
            "Cultures from the type material have not been preserved. However, strain CBS 114.14 from Florida was deposited in the CBS collection in February 1914 by R.E. Clausen, as Gm. limetticola. The strain was not specified as being an ex-type strain, and we suppose that it was one of the samples requested by Clausen from the wither tip of lime in Florida. It is reasonable to consider this culture as authentic material, and we therefore designate a dried subculture as the epitype for Gm. limetticola.",
            "The sequences were compared using BLASTn against the NCBI NR database. Among the top matches, select sequences of ex-type or ex-epitype isolates of Colletotrichum species were chosen for phylogenetic analyses (Supplementary Table S2). Alignments for each gene were performed using MUSCLE v. 3.8.34. We assessed the combinability of the five gene datasets using the Partition Homogeneity Test, as implemented in PAUP* 4.0b4, following the method described by Farris et al. for the incongruence length difference (ILD) test. Sequences from the five genes were manually concatenated and realigned. Phylogenetic analysis was conducted using MrBayes version 3.2.6. The nucleotide substitution models for each gene, determined by jModeltest v. 2.1.7, were included for each gene partition. Following Drummond and Rambaut, four runs with four chains for 5,000,000 generations were set up, discarding the first 25%. Analyses were sampled every 1,000 generations until the average standard deviation of split frequencies fell below 0.01. Maximum likelihood analyses were conducted with the RAxML GUI v. 1.3.14, using a GTRGAMMA substitution model, and bootstrap support was calculated based on 1,000 iterations."

According to available literature, C. nymphaeae is the most common species, while C. godetiae is also frequently reported in European and American strawberry fields [6]. These two species were the most representative in our dataset of isolates related to strawberries in the UK. C. fioriniae has a worldwide distribution and is common on strawberries, but only a few isolates were identified in our collection, and this group was not commonly present in the fields in the UK.",
            "The strains detailed include multiple entries for Colletotrichum nymphaeae and Colletotrichum godetiae. For example, strain codes KM246541 to KM252146 are identified with the genetic identifiers such as ITS, TUB, MAT1-2, and GAPDH. These codes represent different genetic markers used for identification purposes.",
            "In the United Kingdom, five species, including C. nigrum (Liu et al. 2013), the more aggressive C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae, as well as the less aggressive C. godetiae and C. aenigma (Baroncelli et al. 2015), have been reported as strawberry pathogens. Notably, C. nigrum and C. aenigma are outside the C. acutatum complex. In Belgium, four species of the C. acutatum complex\u2014C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, and C. salicis\u2014were identified as strawberry pathogens (Grammen et al. 2019). Both C. fioriniae (Baroncelli et al. 2015) and C. nymphaeae (Jayawardena et al. 2016b) were also isolated from diseased strawberries in France. In Italy, pathogens causing strawberry anthracnose include C. simmondsii (Faedda et al. 2011), C. nymphaeae (Damm et al. 2012), C. acutatum sensu stricto (Vitale and Infantino 2014), and C. siamense (Jayawardena et al. 2016b). Additionally, there have been reports of the C. acutatum complex causing strawberry anthracnose rot without species-level identification in four other European countries: Germany (Nirenberg et al. 2002), Czech Republic (Novotn\u00fd et al. 2007), Finland (Lilja et al. 2011), and Montenegro (Latinovic et al. 2012). Overall, Colletotrichum species infectious to strawberries outside the C. acutatum complex have only been reported in the United Kingdom and Italy.",
            "Another possible synonym of C. nymphaeae is C. nymphaeicola (Kelkar 1972, as C. \"nymphicola\"). Judging from the description and illustration, this is certainly a species of Colletotrichum, but the conidia were described as oblong, measuring 5\u201315 \u00d7 1.5\u20133 \u00b5m. This wide variation in size makes it impossible to place it in any currently defined species. The type was reportedly deposited in HCIO, but apparently no cultures were obtained. Gloeosporium nymphaeae (Hemmi & Kawase 1954) causes symptoms similar to those of C. nymphaeae, but setae were observed, which were not noted in C. nymphaeae by either ourselves or van der Aa (1978). The conidia of Gm. nymphaeae were described as rounded at both ends, measuring 9\u201317 \u00d7 3\u20136 \u00b5m. We have not been able to locate type material or living cultures of this fungus. Another species of Colletotrichum associated with water lilies, C. nupharicola, was described by Johnson et al. (1997). This species appears to have significantly longer and wider conidia than C. nymphaeae, with mean widths of individual strains ranging between 6.5 and 7.5 \u00b5m. The figures are difficult to interpret, and the overall range of conidial size in the description is surprising. It has been found to belong within the C. gloeosporioides complex (Weir et al. 2012).",
            "Notes: Colletotrichum godetiae was described from seeds of Clarkia (syn. Godetia) hybrida cv. Kelvedon Glory by Neergard (1943) and validated with a Latin description seven years later (Neergard 1950). Colletotrichum godetiae corresponds to the C. acutatum group A4 as recognized by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) and to part of clade F as defined by Guerber et al. (2003). According to Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005), group A4 corresponds to group B from New Zealand (Lardner et al. 1999). However, the only C. acutatum group B strain from New Zealand that we have studied belongs to C. acerbum (A6-2). Faedda et al. (2011) described strains from group A4 that cause olive anthracnose in Italy as C. clavatum, not knowing that an older name for this species exists, of which the ex-holotype culture is available in the CBS culture collection. The ex-holo- and ex-paratype strains are included in this study (Fig. 1). Von Arx (1957) regarded C. godetiae as a synonym of Colletotrichum guajavae Damm, P.F. Cannon & Crous, sp. nov. MycoBank MB800501. Fig. 12.",
            "In this study, we found many species that had been considered synonyms of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957) actually belong to the C. acutatum species complex, including C. mahoniae, C. godetiae, Gm. phormii, Gm. lycopersici, and Gm. limetticola. Glomerella miyabeana, treated here as a synonym of the older C. salicis, was regarded as a forma specialis of Ga. cingulata by von Arx (1957). Species treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957) have also been found in the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012, this issue). In this study, 39 strains previously identified as C. gloeosporioides or Ga. cingulata based on morphology actually belong to 14 species in or closely related to the C. acutatum species complex, including C. acutatum, C. australe, C. cosmi, C. costaricense, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. limetticola, C. lupini, C. melonis, C. nymphaeae, C. phormii, C. rhombiforme, C. salicis, and C. orchidophilum.",
            "Notes: Sequence data from the ex-holotype culture of C. nupharicola places it within the C. gloeosporioides complex, genetically close to C. fructicola and C. alienum in the Musae clade. This species appears to be host-specific and is characterized by slow growth in culture and large conidia (Johnson et al. 1997). Johnson et al. (1997) also compare C. nupharicola with another water plant pathogen, C. nymphaeae, which is epitypified and shown to belong to the C. acutatum species complex by Damm et al. (2012a, this issue).",
            "Morphological and Cultural Characterization: Few differences in colony morphology were observed among the five species identified when grown on potato dextrose agar (PDA). All selected isolates developed white colonies that turned gray after 10 days. Isolates of C. nymphaeae and C. gloeosporioides produced numerous conidia on PDA, while the other three species produced fewer conidia (Fig. 5). The conidia produced by C. nymphaeae were sharp at both ends (Fig. 6), which distinguished them from the other four species studied (Table 3).",

Clades 3 and 4 are well-supported (100/1.00 and 100/0.87) and are positioned on long branches, representing C. fioriniae (A3, C1/C2/C3) and C. acutatum (A5, J4), respectively. Clade 5 comprises two sister clades. Colletotrichum godetiae (A4, F1*, 99/1.00), formed by a large number of strains, belongs to the first sister clade and groups (97/1.00) with C. johnstonii (F8, 100/1.00) and a single-strain clade representing C. pyricola (F2). The other sister clade (75/1.00) consists of six subclades: a large, long-branched, and nearly homogenous subclade representing C. salicis (A7, K1, 100/1.00); a short-branched subclade representing C. phormii (91/1.00); C. rhombiforme (A6, 100/1.00), which groups with a single-strain clade representing C. acerbum on a long branch (F1*, 100/1.00); along with C. australe (100/1.00) and C. kinghornii, both on long branches. Strains labeled F1 appear in the phylogeny of Guerber et al. (2003) in different subclades corresponding to C. acerbum, C. godetiae, and probably also C. rhombiforme.",
            "Colletotrichum cosmi is part of clade 2. It can be distinguished from other species by all gene sequences, with only 1 base pair (bp) divergence observed in most cases. Greater sequence divergences are noted in the GAPDH and HIS3 genes; however, when analyzed individually, the species is found within the highly variable C. nymphaeae clade. The closest match in a blastn search using the TUB2 sequence of strain CBS 853.73 (with 99% identity and 4 bp differences) was GU246633 from isolate R14 from Capsicum annuum in South Korea (Sang et al. 2011). The closest match for the GAPDH sequence, covering nearly the full length, showed 98% identity with 4 bp differences, corresponding to HQ846724 from isolate OBP6 from an unknown plant, likely from India (P. Chowdappa, C.S. Chethana, S. Madhura, unpublished data). We do not consider these data sufficient, in isolation, to identify these sequences as originating from C. cosmi. There are 22 sequences in GenBank that match the ITS sequence of strain CBS 853.73 with 99% identity, all exhibiting 2 bp differences."

            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",
            "Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries. A detailed consideration of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the context of strawberry anthracnose are crucial for understanding these dynamics.",
            "Although numerous light and electron microscopic studies have described plant interactions with Colletotrichum species, few have focused on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae-strawberry systems. Understanding the detailed natures of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for grasping the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is a condition where the fungus keeps host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them. Necrotrophy refers to the approach of living host cells, killing them before entering their lumina. Hemibiotrophy describes a phase where the fungus initially enters a biotrophic state and then transitions to a necrotrophic phase. The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen are critical for understanding these dynamics.",
            "On almond leaves, and presumably fruit, a combination of hemibiotrophic and subcuticular intramural necrotrophic infections occurs, resulting in both intra- and intercellular colonization (21) (Fig. 10D). In this instance, colonization is biotrophic following fungal penetration but shifts to necrotrophy during intercellular growth. This is succeeded by inter- and intracellular colonization and the death of the tissue. The mechanism for the shift from biotrophy to necrotrophy is uncertain; however, C. acutatum, along with other species of Colletotrichum, produces ammonia that causes local pH increases during the transition to necrotrophy (70). In most host-pathogen interactions, the specific cellular-level interactions remain unknown and may represent a combination of strategies, as shown in the preceding descriptions.",
            "C. acutatum and C. fragariae underwent a very brief biotrophic phase (less than 12 hours) before entering their extended necrotrophic phase. Representatives of both species of fungi were observed entering living host cells and developing a matrix comparable to that described in reported biotrophic systems, but they killed the host cells within a few hours. Previous descriptions for other Colletotrichum species cited biotrophy as occurring at a minimum of \"less than 24 hours.\" However, a scenario where a living cell is entered and quickly killed might be considered a modification of necrotrophy, rather than biotrophy or hemibiotrophy.",
            "Our model is general in that it has one conceptual structure that incorporates the key epidemiological components of anthracnose diseases. Although Colletotrichum spp. exhibit various lifestyles categorized as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic\u2014with hemibiotrophic being the most common (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017)\u2014all species have a necrotrophic stage (Prusky et al., 2013), except for a few species that live entirely as endophytes (e.g., some species in the gloeosporioides clade on Salacia and Camellia; Bhagya et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). The timing of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on the host, its growth stage, environmental conditions (Wharton et al., 2001; Peres et al., 2005), and the phylogenetic clade (De Silva et al., 2017). For instance, the graminicola and destructivum clades have a short biotrophic period, while the acutatum and gloeosporioides clades exhibit a quiescent lifestyle on certain fruit trees like almond and guava (De Silva et al., 2017). Our model accounts for the common attributes of Colletotrichum lifestyles in terms of: (i) a reproductive (asexual) stage, which occurs on the host plant or in plant debris; (ii) infection caused by conidia; (iii) an asymptomatic (biotrophic) stage that can be either short or extended, depending on the incubation period; (iv) a necrotrophic stage in which host cells are invaded and killed, leading to the appearance of symptoms (lesions in our model); and (v) a sporulation stage, i.e., the production of secondary inoculum on lesions.",
            "O\u2019Connell et al. and Perfect et al. described two types of interactions between Colletotrichum species and their hosts: intercellular hemibiotrophy and subcuticular intramural necrotrophy. Regarding C. acutatum, there are few studies on the cytology of the infection process and the nature of early biotrophic relationships or quiescent infections established between the pathogen and host. However, based on studies with C. acutatum on specific hosts, four types of interactions or infection strategies can be described.",
            "Race-specific resistance is most frequently found in biotrophic plant-microbe interactions where there is prolonged contact between the pathogen and the living host (20). Colletotrichum species use nutritional strategies ranging from necrotrophy to hemibiotrophy (29). Colletotrichum species such as C. orbiculare, C. graminicola, C. sublineolum, C. destructivum, C. truncatum, and C. linicola are all considered hemibiotrophs, as there is an asymptomatic biotrophic interaction between these species and host cells before the reaction becomes necrotrophic (29). The occurrence of a number of dominant race-specific resistance genes in beans against C. lindemuthianum, a member of the C. orbiculare species aggregate, suggests that gene-for-gene interactions play an important role in host resistance to these pathogens.",
            "In blueberry and many fruit crops (e.g., peach, apple, and various tropical fruits), other interactions or infection strategies may occur. These interactions can be classified as intracellular hemibiotrophy when infecting ripe fruit of susceptible cultivars, or subcuticular intramural necrotrophy when infecting fruit of resistant cultivars (Fig. 10C) (90). The hemibiotrophic interaction begins with appressorium formation on the fruit surface and continues with the establishment of quiescent infections featuring a relatively long biotrophic phase. As the fruit ripens, necrotrophic inter- and intracellular colonization occurs, leading to extensive tissue invasion and subsequent sporulation of the fungus.",
            "C. acutatum and C. fragariae underwent a very brief biotrophic phase (less than 12 hours) before entering their extended necrotrophic phase. Representatives of both species were observed entering living host cells and developing a matrix comparable to that described in reported biotrophic systems, but they killed the host cells within a few hours. Previous descriptions for other Colletotrichum species cite biotrophy at a minimum of \u201cless than 24 hours.\u201d However, a situation in which a living cell is entered and quickly killed might be considered a modification of necrotrophy rather than biotrophy or hemibiotrophy."

            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",

The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",

            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).",

This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots.

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",

The Mediterranean countries rank second only to China in fruit production and are the largest fruit exporters after South Africa (FAO 2016). Therefore, understanding all pathogens affecting this crop is imperative. The current study aimed to investigate the major citrus production areas in Europe through large-scale sampling and to identify isolates using a polyphasic approach. This method revealed many cryptic and new Colletotrichum species associated with citrus, classified into four modern taxonomic species complexes. Surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 across commercial nurseries, orchards, gardens, and plant collections aimed to determine the occurrence of Colletotrichum spp. related to citrus and allied genera (Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, Poncirus). The study's specific objectives included conducting extensive sampling of fresh plant materials, cultivating Colletotrichum isolates, subjecting these isolates to DNA sequence analyses alongside morphological characterization, comparing results with other phylogenetic studies, and evaluating the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species on citrus fruit. Major diseases of citrus caused by Colletotrichum species include postbloom fruit drop (PFD), petal necrosis, and key lime anthracnose (KLA), with C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides being significant agents. Extensive investigations across several citrus-producing regions revealed varying associations of these pathogens with different citrus species.",
            "Species of Colletotrichum are recognized as significant plant pathogens, saprobes, and endophytes across a variety of plant hosts. Several species are notably problematic for citrus, causing pre- and post-harvest infections such as anthracnose, postbloom fruit drop, tear stain, and stem-end rot, as well as wither-tip on twigs. This study utilized multi-locus sequence typing to investigate the occurrence, diversity, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with citrus and allied genera in European orchards, nurseries, and gardens. Surveys were conducted in Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain during 2015 and 2016, resulting in the isolation of 174 Colletotrichum strains from symptomatic leaves, fruits, petals, and twigs. A multi-locus phylogeny was constructed based on seven genomic loci (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, HIS3, and TUB2), and the morphological characteristics of the isolates were assessed. Preliminary pathogenicity tests were performed on orange fruits using representative isolates. The Colletotrichum strains were classified into three major species complexes. Within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, C. gloeosporioides s.str., and two novel species (C. helleniense and C. hystricis) were identified. In the C. boninense species complex, C. karstii, C. novae-zelandiae, and two novel species (C. catinaense and C. limonicola) were noted, while C. acutatum s.str. was identified as a member of the C. acutatum species complex. C. gloeosporioides and C. karstii were the predominant species isolated. This study represents the first report of C. acutatum on citrus.",
            "Colletotrichum fioriniae, C. pyricola, and C. salicis (Guerber et al. 2003; Damm et al. 2012) were identified as the primary strains responsible for bitter rot in apples in Croatia. Most of these strains were identified as C. fioriniae, with some classified as C. clavatum (a synonym of C. godetiae) based on ITS sequences (Ivic et al. 2012). The first report of apple bitter rot in the United Kingdom was also linked to C. godetiae (Baroncelli et al. 2014). One strain shared the same ITS sequence as strains BBA 65797 and IMI 345581, the latter of which had previously been identified as C. salicis by Damm et al. (2012). However, it is important to note that related species may exhibit identical ITS sequences, as this locus is not always informative at the species level within the C. acutatum species complex. Other strains from apples in Europe included in the study by Damm et al. (2012) were also identified as C. fioriniae and C. godetiae. In contrast, strains from apples in Japan, identified by Sato and Moriwaki (2013) through a multilocus analysis, were found to belong to C. nymphaeae and C. godetiae. Similarly, strains from bitter rot of apple in Korea, as studied by Lee et al. (2007), likely belong to C. fioriniae and a species within the C. acutatum clade 2 (which includes C. nymphaeae and related species) according to Damm et al. (2012). Previously isolated strains from apples and other fruits in Brazil that belong to the C. acutatum species complex were identified only as C. acutatum s. lat. (Gonz\u00e1lez et al. 2006; Giaretta et al. 2010). If sequences of these strains were generated at all, only ITS sequences are available on GenBank, which do not permit accurate species identification within this complex. As a result, the name C. acutatum is still used broadly in Brazil (Serra et al. 2011; De Souza et al. 2013; Barquero Quir\u00f3s et al. 2013; Ciampi-Guillardi et al. 2014). To date, only a few species within the C. acutatum species complex have been identified in Brazil, including a report of C. nymphaeae causing apple bitter rot in southern Brazil (Velho et al. 2014). Therefore, the aim of the present study was to identify Colletotrichum strains associated with various fruit crops from different localities in Brazil, utilizing both multilocus molecular techniques and morphological data, and to describe the new species encountered.",
            "In Europe, Colletotrichum karstii has also been detected on various hosts, including tropical fruits, cotton, and lupine plants (Damm et al. 2012b, Ismail et al. 2015). In our investigation, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides was predominantly observed, consistent with recent global findings (Lima et al. 2011, Huang et al. 2013, Aiello et al. 2015, Honger et al. 2016, Ramos et al. 2016, Rhaiem & Taylor 2016). This species was isolated from all citrus organs sampled\u2014leaves, flowers, fruits, and twigs\u2014demonstrating its status as the most aggressive Colletotrichum species. It is recognized as a pathogen of major cultivated citrus species worldwide (Huang et al. 2013).

Strains of C. godetiae infectious to strawberries have been documented in Ireland and Norway (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Chethana et al. 2016). In Denmark, C. nymphaeae is the only Colletotrichum species reported as a strawberry pathogen (Braganca et al. 2016), with similar reports from Bulgaria (Bobev et al. 2002; Jelev et al. 2008; Jayawardena et al. 2016b), Switzerland, and Portugal (Baroncelli et al. 2015).

For instance, only six out of the 24 Colletotrichum pathogens of chili have been identified in Australia (De Silva et al. 2017a), while only three species have been reported in Thailand (Mongkolporn and Taylor 2018) and five in Malaysia (Noor and Zakaria 2018). In most previous studies, species identification relied solely on morphological data, leading to uncertainties in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum spp. responsible for anthracnose in chili-producing Asian countries. Accurate identification of these pathogens is crucial for mitigating the risk of new pathogen incursions, which could have devastating impacts on local industries. Additionally, precise species identification is vital for resistance breeding programs and understanding the host range of various species. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. karstii, C. siamense, and C. truncatum, have broad host ranges (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012b). The main Colletotrichum species known to cause anthracnose in chili are primarily from the acutatum and gloeosporioides complexes. Recently, additional species from the boninense and orchidarium complexes have also been implicated (Diao et al. 2017; Damm et al. 2019). Therefore, understanding the taxonomy, diversity, pathogenicity, and distribution of Colletotrichum species affecting chili is essential.",

Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 did not impact the recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. from roots but did increase root weight and the number of lesion nematodes.

Combining \u2018Saia\u2019 oats or sorgho-sudangrass rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization led to a reduction in lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) numbers in subsequent strawberry roots compared to controls. Furthermore, the combination of \u2018Saia\u2019 or \u2018Garry\u2019 oats as a precrop with applications of (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot severity relative to controls. Only the \u2018Garry\u2019 oat rotation reduced strawberry root colonization by Rhizoctonia fragariae when compared to controls. Additional effects associated with (NH4)2SO4 treatment included a decrease in rhizosphere soil pH by 0.2 units, a reduction in fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere by 10- to 15-fold, and leaves with higher concentrations of nitrogen, potassium, sulfur, manganese, and zinc compared to plants treated with Ca(NO3)2. Therefore, rotation with \u2018Saia\u2019 oats combined with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization may suppress strawberry black root rot and enhance yields through multiple effects on the host, pathogens, and associated microflora.",
            "The combined effects of rotation crops and nitrogen fertilizers were examined on the strawberry black root rot disease complex. In July 1995, microplots were filled with soil that had a history of strawberry black root rot and seeded with two types of oats (Avena strigosa \u2018Saia oats\u2019 or A. sativa \u2018Garry oats\u2019) or with sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor \u00d7 S. sudanense \u2018Triple S\u2019).

Strawberries that had been precropped with \u2018Saia\u2019 oats produced 135% more runners and 38% more early fruit yield compared to those grown in control microplots. Total fruit yield was not affected by the treatments.",
            "Results: Differences in leaf area were observed in July 1996 (see Table 1), but not in June (data not shown). Plants fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 exhibited a 36% increase in leaf area (P = 0.02) and a 41% increase in runners (P = 0.02) compared to those treated with Ca(NO3)2. Pre-cropping with 'Saia' oats resulted in a 35% increase in runners (P = 0.04) compared to continuous strawberry culture. In June 1997, early berry yields were higher in plants pre-cropped with Saia oats compared to controls (P = 0.04). Total yield was not significantly affected, although trends mirrored those of the early yield. Nitrogen fertilizers did not influence yield. In September 1997, the fresh weights of roots from strawberry plants pre-cropped with Saia oats and treated with (NH4)2SO4 were greater than any other treatment combination (P = 0.05). Additionally, fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 produced plants that were 17% larger than those fertilized with Ca(NO3)2 (P = 0.05).

This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.",

The G143A and F129L mutations in cytb were identified, conferring high and moderate resistance levels, respectively. In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011). Additionally, this mutation has been shown to be stable in C. acutatum populations and did not result in a fitness penalty in laboratory assays (Forcelini et al. 2018). In our study, QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were similarly pathogenic; however, disease severity and mortality after inoculation with resistant isolates were higher than those for QoI-sensitive isolates. Several studies on other fungal pathogens have indicated that resistant isolates harboring the G143A mutation did not exhibit reduced fitness compared to wild-type sensitive isolates (Corio-Costet et al. 2011; Karaoglanidis et al. 2011; Rallos et al. 2014).

The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013).

There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.",

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",

C. orbiculare is a slow-growing species with a low optimum temperature. These characteristics, along with the distinctive spore and cultural traits, make this species one of the easiest to identify. Host specificity occurs, as isolates from celery and safflower do not rot watermelon.",
            "Some segregate taxa within the C. boninense complex indicate host specificity or at least a preference for particular plant groups. For example, Morikawi et al. (2003) identified four molecular subgroups within the species based on ITS1 data. The primary branch differentiated strains from monocotyledonous (monocot) and dicotyledonous (dicot) plant hosts. While the dicot clade did not exhibit any clear substructure linked to host specificity, the monocot clade comprised three subclades: one was restricted to Orchidaceae, while the other two contained strains from Crinum (Amaryllidaceae). The dicot clade corresponds to C. karstii, as recognized in this paper, whereas the monocot clade includes C. boninense s. str. Our research does not support this division. Although C. karstii is found on a variety of dicots, it has also been observed on Orchidaceae and other monocots, particularly Musa spp. Among the other segregate species we recognize, C. dracaenae and C. hippeastri appear to be specific at the host genus level, though the number of strains we have examined remains insufficient to confirm this.",

For example, C. boninense was found as an endophyte in the leaves of several tree species in the Iwokrama Forest, which were associated with diseases affecting Leucospermum. Reports also document C. boninense as an endophyte in Protea cynaroides in Australia and Zimbabwe, and with Eucalyptus, as noted by Pileggi et al.

Other isolates associated with anthracnose on tamarillo, Passiflora, and mango were found in Colombia (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003) and as endophytes in coffee plants from Colombia and Hawaii (Vega et al. 2010).

It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades.

Seven of the new species are known only from New Zealand, possibly reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was established, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and renamed as C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening, which may extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, and conidia featuring a prominent basal scar.

To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable hosts to strawberries, 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts, were wound-inoculated onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper (Smith, 2002).

Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.",

This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

            "The incidence of flower blight caused by Colletotrichum acutatum in field conditions, which resemble practices of strawberry growers, was strongly influenced by the irrigation system, type of mulch, and host genetic resistance. Flower blight and fruit rot were minimized when using irrigation systems and mulching types that reduced water splash. Organic materials, particularly dried grass mulch, significantly lowered disease levels under overhead irrigation. Conversely, organic mulches did not have a notable effect on disease levels under localized drip or low-pressure irrigation, likely due to the reduced water splash inherent to these practices.",
            "In conclusion, our studies on cultural control of strawberry anthracnose demonstrated that the choice of host genotype, localized irrigation, and dried organic mulches significantly reduced disease incidence in the field. There were synergistic effects when these practices were adopted concurrently. In contrast, selecting a more susceptible cultivar, using overhead sprinkler irrigation, and applying plastic mulch favored higher levels of flower blight. While these results should be interpreted with caution due to the lack of perfectly replicated trials, each management factor studied (irrigation system, grass mulch, and host genotype) was replicated in multiple experiments, partially validating these conclusions. Moreover, adopting these cultural practices did not lead to yield loss in the absence of disease. More diseased fruit was found in plots of 'Dover' than in those of 'Campinas' because more flowers of 'Dover' survived earlier in the season, providing more healthy tissue for later infections.",
            "Anthracnose spreads within a field by splashing water, and living mulches (such as wheat, rye, or ryegrass) in row middles have been shown to reduce disease spread within a field. Sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, may be used to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass (Gupton, 2000). Organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, also reduce splash and result in a lower incidence of anthracnose compared to rows mulched with plastic (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Additionally, anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation (Madden, 1992; Smith and Spiers, 1986). Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate.",

In New England, straw is commonly used as a winter mulch for strawberries, leading many growers to adopt grain rotations to produce straw. However, the effectiveness of rotation crops can vary regarding their susceptibility as hosts to R. fragariae and P. penetrans. Past research has shown that \u2018Saia\u2019 oats (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and \u2018Triple S\u2019 sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor \u00d7 S. sudanense) are poor hosts for these pathogens, whereas \u2018Garry\u2019 oats (Avena sativa L), rye (Secale cereale L), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), canola (Brassica napus L), and strawberries may either increase or have no effect on the population densities of the pathogens.

Eastburn and Gubler found that mycelium in strawberry tissue survived in air-dried soil for at least seven weeks, even at temperatures up to 40\u00b0C, and it remained viable in moist soil for seven weeks at both 10\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. Freeman et al. reported that conidia of C. acutatum survived for at least one year in air-dry soil; however, in soil at field capacity, conidia survived for less than two weeks. At 11% soil moisture, the time required for 95% loss of viability was between 70 and 75 days. C. acutatum could not be recovered from strawberry crowns that were naturally infected and buried in either methyl-bromide fumigated or untreated soil after five months. In Florida, C. acutatum could no longer be recovered from buried infected crowns after 56 days.",

The number of conidia of C. gloeosporioides, the causal agent of water yam (Dioscorea alata) anthracnose in Guadeloupe, was higher in artificially inoculated residues on the soil surface than in residues buried at a depth of 0.1 meters, which decomposed more quickly (Ripoche et al., 2008). In Finland, C. acutatum can survive one winter in strawberry residues on the soil surface or buried in soil, as well as in infected weed debris, and can infect young strawberry plants in greenhouse tests (Parikka et al., 2006). In most of these studies, the species were identified based on morphology and were not compared with type specimens or at the molecular level, making the species names likely inaccurate. Future studies should use molecular data to compare against type specimens.",
            "The results indicated that viable conidia could be recovered for up to 12 months under dry soil conditions (1%). Conidia associated with leaf debris maintained viability at levels above 100 conidia per gram for 31 weeks. When leaf debris was added to soil and incubated in controlled environments, concentrations of detectable conidia increased in the first week but eventually declined over time. Notably, long-term survival of C. acutatum in leaf debris buried outdoors mirrored that of conidia incorporated into soil.",
            "Survival of C. acutatum in Soil and Leaf Debris: Populations of C. acutatum conidia recovered from laboratory soil tests decreased steadily, especially under moist or saturated conditions. Within 1 week, detectable populations decreased by more than 30% across all treatments. By 4 weeks, the number of viable conidia fell below 100 conidia per gram of soil when soil moisture was above 6%. In contrast, under dry conditions (1% moisture), it took 105 days for populations to fall below 100 conidia per gram of soil.",

In leaf debris, the fungus remained viable after 56 days when soil moisture was at 6% or less, but not at higher moisture levels. C. acutatum remained viable for at least 105 days when infected plants were buried in field plots, and conidia remained viable on fabric for 35 to 45 days.",

Recovery of C. acutatum from infected tissue declined rapidly under flooded soil conditions at soil temperatures of 25\u00b0C or higher. In contrast, recovery from tissue samples was 100% after 7 weeks at both 10\u00b0C and 25\u00b0C. Similar results were observed in our study regarding the survival of conidia and sclerotia in infected leatherleaf fern debris under varying soil moisture levels.",

Instruments connected to a data logger monitored soil moisture at a depth of 3 cm. Infected fern fronds were chopped and placed in nylon mesh bags buried 3 cm deep in shade structures. Bags were retrieved weekly for four weeks and then every three weeks until C. acutatum could no longer be detected.",
            "Sclerotia of C. acutatum added to soil under laboratory conditions maintained high viability (\u2265 100 sclerotia per gram of soil) under dry conditions for 26 weeks; however, under moist conditions (\u2265 12% moisture), populations declined to very low levels by day 56. Viable sclerotia were consistently recovered from the soil for up to 47 weeks after incorporation.",
            "Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season."

Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",

Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant issue in strawberry nurseries and fruit production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986). The increase in anthracnose-related losses since the 1980s is likely due to the shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture systems and changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are gaining importance, leading to major economic losses for strawberry growers globally. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Genetic and biological diversity associated with various species names has been a significant focus in early studies. These papers often discussed morphological similarities among fungi from different hosts; however, the breadth of these similarities became of little practical use to plant pathologists. They provided minimal information regarding pathogenicity, host range, or other attributes of the Colletotrichum species described. The studies by von Arx & M\u00fcller (1954) and von Arx (1957) did not rely on direct examination of type material for all species, leading to questions about whether the species in question were indeed distinct. Some research attempted to explore the connections between various Colletotrichum species and their sexual Glomerella state (e.g., Shear & Wood 1907, Ocfemia 1925).",
            "In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).",
            "Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al. (1994).",

            "Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.",
            "The shift towards multi-gene phylogenetic analysis has significantly changed the classification and species concepts within the Colletotrichum genus (Cannon et al. 2012, Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2013, 2014, Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum species are classified as latent plant pathogens, endophytes, epiphytes, or saprobes, and may adopt a pathogenic lifestyle when host plants are stressed (Damm et al. 2009, Cannon et al. 2012). Systematic studies of nearly all recognized species have identified several complexes, revealing that some Colletotrichum species historically considered as causal agents of significant plant diseases are actually different species. For example, C. alienum is now recognized as a key species in Proteaceae cultivation (Liu et al. 2013), while C. acutatum s.lat. was found in Mediterranean countries causing diseases in various hosts, such as Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa (Garrido et al. 2008), Arbutus unedo (Polizzi et al. 2011), and Olea europaea (Talhinhas et al. 2011).

In all cases, we address the potential issues related to misidentification of taxa. Extensive research by numerous scholars has been conducted on Colletotrichum dematium, C. destructivum, and C. fragariae, and these data are reviewed. The reviews highlight the importance of correctly identifying strains before commencing scholarly research."

Some of these taxa have been designated as separate species, such as C. fragariae (Johnston et al., 2008). The ITS region has a limited ability to discriminate clades within this group; hence, a more appropriate biomarker is required for barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding should have low heterogeneity within species, yet enough variation to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",

            "The excerpt discusses the evaluation of commercial strawberry cultivars' resistance to anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. It highlights the prevalence of anthracnose fruit rot in Iran and assesses the susceptibility of 52 commercial cultivars against the pathogen. The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",
            "These findings align with previous studies indicating that susceptibility to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) varies among different organs of a cultivar, including fruit, leaf, and root. Notably, no relationship was established between the susceptibility of various cultivars and the different organs of a single cultivar (Delp and Milholland, 1980; Smith and Spires, 1982; Smith and Black, 1990; Chandler et al., 1997). Furthermore, the presence of the pathogen might not cause symptoms on foliage, leading to latent infections. Consistent with Shuman (2001), our results suggest that the detached fruit assay is a better indicator of AFR disease susceptibility, though other methods could also enhance the understanding of disease epidemiology.",
            "The USDA-ARS program resulted in over 1,500 anthracnose-resistant selections from seedlings field-tested in Mississippi. Four of these selections were released as breeding lines (Galletta et al., 1993), and one was released as the cultivar Pelican, which is highly resistant to anthracnose crown rot caused by Colletotrichum fragariae and to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum (Smith et al., 1998). Pelican is also resistant to five races of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae. Other selections have been utilized as parent lines in various breeding programs. To enhance genetic diversity in strawberry germplasm used in breeding, anthracnose-resistant clones have been identified in native plant collections and are being incorporated as parent lines (Lewers et al., 2007).",
            "Among the four species identified, C. gloeosporioides was the major species causing anthracnose in this study, being found in every orchard from which isolates were taken. The pathogenicity assay demonstrated that all isolates were more aggressive on fruit than on leaves, likely due to the higher sugar content in fruit serving as a carbon source for fungal growth. Both C. asianum and C. gloeosporioides exhibited similar levels of aggressiveness on mango fruit, producing larger lesions compared to C. siamense and C. acutatum. The lesions\u2019 colors also varied slightly; C. asianum produced dark brown spots, while the other three species produced lighter brown spots. In leaf pathogenicity tests, C. siamense was the most aggressive, possibly due to species-specific host responses. Further testing with different mango cultivars is necessary to validate this hypothesis.",

The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",

            "During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017). In pathogenicity tests, all C. nymphaeae isolates were able to...",
            "In the in vitro assays, anthracnose fruit rot symptoms were observed (e.g., Fig. 3B) for various isolates tested, displaying different levels of aggressiveness as reflected by the disease index, which ranged from 0.08 to 3.0 (see Table 3). The variation in aggressiveness among different isolates was evident from the incidence rates, which ranged from 8.33% to 100%, with only four out of 38 isolates showing incidence rates of 91.7% to 100%. Lesion types varied, ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 (see S1 Table). Upon evaluating lesion morphology, different types of lesions could be distinguished on fruits, ranging from brown lesions containing orange conidia to those fully covered with aerial mycelium, varying in size. The isolate C. nymphaeae CSL 899 was the most aggressive on strawberry fruits, with the highest disease index (3.0), indicating symptoms covering more than 66% of the fruit surface."

Selecting strawberries with an erect fruiting habit that ripen most of their fruit at once and are easy to cap\u2014important traits for machine harvesting\u2014is feasible due to the variability in available strawberry germplasm. Inheritance patterns for simultaneous ripening of fruit indicated that early-season parents, such as \u2018Sunrise\u2019, could produce progeny with a high percentage of ripe fruit at one time (Lawrence et al., 1975). Semi-erect and easy-capping types could also be derived from parents such as \u2018Hood\u2019, \u2018Benton\u2019, and other selections from the Pacific Northwest and California. Additionally, selections that have over 80% of the fruit ripe at one time and possess the easy-cap character could also exhibit good processing qualities (Lawrence et al., 1975). The cultivar \u2018Linn\u2019 was introduced in 1975 as a machine-harvest processing berry; however, commercial machine harvesting did not materialize, and \u2018Linn\u2019 lost favor because it does not maintain berry size as plants age and is too tart for the fresh market.

            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",

The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012).",
            "Our model is general in that it has one conceptual structure that incorporates the key epidemiological components of anthracnose diseases. Although Colletotrichum spp. exhibit various lifestyles categorized as necrotrophic, hemibiotrophic, latent or quiescent, and endophytic\u2014with hemibiotrophic being the most common (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017)\u2014all species have a necrotrophic stage (Prusky et al., 2013), except for a few species that live entirely as endophytes (e.g., some species in the gloeosporioides clade on Salacia and Camellia; Bhagya et al., 2011; Liu et al., 2015). The timing of the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy depends on the host, its growth stage, environmental conditions (Wharton et al., 2001; Peres et al., 2005), and the phylogenetic clade (De Silva et al., 2017). For instance, the graminicola and destructivum clades have a short biotrophic period, while the acutatum and gloeosporioides clades exhibit a quiescent lifestyle on certain fruit trees like almond and guava (De Silva et al., 2017). Our model accounts for the common attributes of Colletotrichum lifestyles in terms of: (i) a reproductive (asexual) stage, which occurs on the host plant or in plant debris; (ii) infection caused by conidia; (iii) an asymptomatic (biotrophic) stage that can be either short or extended, depending on the incubation period; (iv) a necrotrophic stage in which host cells are invaded and killed, leading to the appearance of symptoms (lesions in our model); and (v) a sporulation stage, i.e., the production of secondary inoculum on lesions.",
            "Prusky et al. (2013) discussed the quiescent and necrotrophic lifestyle choices of these fungi during postharvest disease development. They emphasized how these lifestyle choices influence disease outcomes. The distinct population structure of Colletotrichum species associated with olive anthracnose in the Algarve region reflects a complex host-pathogen relationship.",
            "On almond leaves, and presumably fruit, a combination of hemibiotrophic and subcuticular intramural necrotrophic infections occurs, resulting in both intra- and intercellular colonization (21) (Fig. 10D). In this instance, colonization is biotrophic following fungal penetration but shifts to necrotrophy during intercellular growth. This is succeeded by inter- and intracellular colonization and the death of the tissue. The mechanism for the shift from biotrophy to necrotrophy is uncertain; however, C. acutatum, along with other species of Colletotrichum, produces ammonia that causes local pH increases during the transition to necrotrophy (70). In most host-pathogen interactions, the specific cellular-level interactions remain unknown and may represent a combination of strategies, as shown in the preceding descriptions.",
            "Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).",
            "Another significant finding from comparative studies is that lifestyle and host preference do not correlate with phylogenetic relationships (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). A comparison of the genomes of the endophyte C. tofieldiae and the closely related pathogen C. incanum indicated that the transition to an endophytic lifestyle was associated with a reduction in the number of predicted effectors and an expansion of chitin-binding and secondary metabolism-related proteins (Hacquard et al., 2016). In contrast, relatively distantly related members of the C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides species complexes exhibit remarkably similar repertoires of carbohydrate-active enzymes and secreted proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). This observation suggests that these gene families evolved recently and independently in these two phylogenetically separated lineages (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016). Further comparative analyses of the genomes within the C. acutatum species complex revealed that necrosis and ethylene-inducing peptide 1-like proteins were twice as abundant as in the other fungi studied. The large number of these genes underscores their potential significance in the pathogenicity of these species.",
            "Colletotrichum species have been reported as endophytes, epiphytes, saprobes, plant pathogens, and even human pathogens (Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Cano et al., 2004; Kumar and Hyde, 2004; Photita et al., 2004, 2005; Promputtha et al., 2007). Species that cause serious plant diseases are often isolated as endophytes from healthy plants and have also been identified as saprobes on dead plant material (Photita et al., 2001; Kumar and Hyde, 2004; Liu et al., 2007; Promputtha et al., 2007; Damm et al., 2009; Prihastuti et al., 2009). In many cases, the same species have been recorded with several lifestyles; however, due to the ambiguity of species identification, it is not always clear whether they are definitively the same species. The question of how and if taxa change their lifestyles from non-pathogenic to pathogenic still needs to be addressed and remains an important unresolved issue in the study of Colletotrichum."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Strawberry, eggplant, tomato, and pepper plants were inoculated with a conidial suspension of C. acutatum derived from strawberry. Conidia were recovered from all plants over a 2- to 3-month period, regardless of whether overhead or drip irrigation was used (see Fig. 2). The number of conidia recovered from strawberry was comparable to that from the other plants at all time points and, in most cases, the differences were not significant (P < 0.05) across the different plant species, although disease symptoms were observed only on the strawberry plants. Significant numbers of conidia were still recovered from the plants at the end of the experiment, indicating that the survival potential of the fungus on all plant species exceeded 3 months.",
            "In Israel, inoculation of isolates of C. acutatum from anemone and strawberry into each host resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms on both plant species. Molecular studies indicated that the isolates from the two hosts were similar and formed a single genetic subgroup. Isolates of C. acutatum were recovered from pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, as well as from weeds of the genera Vicia and Conyza; however, disease symptoms occurred only on strawberry. C. acutatum isolates from tulip tree in Argentina were also pathogenic to strawberry fruit. Thus, strawberry isolates of C. acutatum can parasitize and cause disease on other hosts or, alternatively, survive on other crops and weeds without producing symptoms.",
            "The fungus was shown to survive on asymptomatic leaves of several plant species under greenhouse conditions (12). Studies suggested that symptomless foliage might play an important role in the anthracnose disease cycle, acting both as a refuge for fungal survival and as a source of inoculum for fruit and flower infections (12, 19, 33). Temperature and wetness have been reported to affect mycelial growth (1, 7, 11, 21, 37, 39), as well as the germination and sporulation of C. acutatum on agar (11), and its infection and sporulation on fruit (18, 39). However, similar studies on strawberry foliage have not been conducted. Additionally, the production of secondary conidia was not addressed in earlier research.",
            "In strawberries, C. acutatum is typically introduced into production fields from nurseries. While some plants may exhibit symptoms, often the pathogen is introduced through asymptomatic leaves or petioles, likely as appressoria or quiescent infections. It remains unclear whether quiescent infections develop into lesions or if appressoria germinate to produce conidia. However, conidia of C. acutatum can generate several secondary conidia from each deposited conidium on the leaf surface. This suggests that the fungus is reproducing by utilizing nutrients on the leaf surface rather than relying on reserves from the original conidium. In these instances, it appears that the fungus is growing as an epiphyte rather than producing quiescent infections.",
            "In inoculations conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions, C. acutatum from strawberry was isolated from inoculated plants that did not exhibit disease symptoms but maintained virulence on strawberry. The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods. Furthermore, it has been shown that C. acutatum from strawberry can survive for nine months within plant debris in soil.",
            "The epiphytic behavior of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may play a critical role in the strawberry anthracnose disease cycle. Recent studies have shown that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on strawberry leaves without visible symptom development and can persist on symptomless foliage of strawberries and weeds for several weeks. As a result, symptomless leaves may act as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose. Similarly, symptomless foliage of tomato and citrus has been reported to provide inoculum for diseases caused by C. coccodes and C. acutatum, respectively.",
            "This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.",
            "Symptomless foliage harbors inoculum for fruit and flower infections by several Colletotrichum species (7, 21, 28). Pantidou and Schroeder (21) demonstrated that conidia of C. phomoides harvested from symptomless tomato leaves could cause infections on tomato fruit. In citrus, C. acutatum survives on leaves as quiescent appressoria (28, 30), which can be stimulated to germinate and produce secondary conidia, serving as inoculum for flower infections. It has also been suggested that quiescent infections on strawberry leaves may provide inoculum for strawberry anthracnose epidemics (23). However, the potential for inoculum production on symptomless strawberry leaves has not been investigated. A better understanding of the ecology of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage before the onset of fruit rot symptoms may yield insights to improve management strategies for strawberry anthracnose.",
            "A difference between the mean disease severity ratings of Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae in both experiments confirmed previous findings (Smith and Black, 1990) that C. acutatum produces less severe plant disease reactions than C. fragariae. Colletotrichum acutatum is occasionally isolated from the crowns of dying plants in the field, but it primarily acts as a fruit rot organism with the potential to cause crown rot.",
            "Our evidence suggests that Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum can survive and multiply on symptomless strawberry leaves, and that the production of secondary conidia may increase inoculum when susceptible tissue is not available. Greater awareness of the surreptitious fungal dynamics on symptomless plants may also justify changes in currently recommended control strategies. For instance, early fungicide applications might effectively reduce initial inoculum production on developing plants, thereby decreasing subsequent epidemic development on fruit."

In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate. Anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of calcium chloride developed less fruit rot than that from plants receiving soil applications of calcium chloride (Smith and Gupton, 1993).",
            "The form of nitrogen significantly influenced both the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and the growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg\u00b7L\u20131).",

            "Nitrogen is absorbed by plant roots in two forms: ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N). Ammonium ions are produced in soils through the breakdown of organic matter (OM), manures, urea, or ammonium-containing fertilizers. Nitrate ions are the final form of nitrogen breakdown and reactions (excluding gaseous forms of nitrogen). They can also be supplied to the soil through fertilizers.",
            "Nitrogen can be lost from the soil in several ways, including volatilization, anaerobic denitrification, and leaching. Normally, ammonium does not leach from the soil because its positive charge is attracted to and \u201cheld\u201d by the negative charges present on the surfaces of clay and humus particles. However, when ammonium is transformed into nitrate, it loses its positive charge, and the soil no longer retains the available nitrogen unless positive charges are present (anion exchange capacity). Water percolating through the soil profile may leach and deplete mobile nitrate from the upper layers to the lower layers and even into the groundwater if leaching is excessive. Such excessive nitrate leaching is often a consequence of inadequate nitrogen fertilizer management.",
            ") ratio. Ammonium and nitrate, plus nitrite (NO2), are quantified through steam distillation of ammonia (NH3), utilizing heavy magnesium oxide (MgO) for ammonium and Devarda\u2019s alloy for nitrate. The distillate is collected in saturated boric acid (H3BO3) and titrated to pH 5.0 with dilute sulfuric acid (H2SO4). This method determines dissolved and adsorbed forms of ammonium, nitrate, and nitrite in soils. The sum determined by this method is referred to as mineral nitrogen.",
            "There is a striking positive correlation between the effect of various cultural practices on nitrification and the severity of take-all. The use of a nitrification inhibitor with ammonium, along with conditions and crop sequences that inhibit nitrification, also reduces take-all (21, 22), and vice versa. However, some practices, such as planting oats before wheat in rotation, have little apparent effect on nitrification but provide some of the most effective control of take-all (3.12, 22). This suggests that the form of nitrogen, as influenced by the rate of nitrification, may act indirectly or in conjunction with other factors to influence the severity of take-all.",
            "The application of nitrogen (N) in the form of calcium nitrate (Ca(NO3)2) significantly reduced the severity of anthracnose crown rot in strawberries. In contrast, the levels of phosphorus (P) and potassium (K) in fertilizers did not have a similar effect. Plants receiving N as Ca(NO3)2 exhibited fewer symptoms of anthracnose crown rot compared to those receiving N in ammonium form. Although these trials were conducted with potted plants in a greenhouse, the findings are applicable to strawberries grown in sandy soils, typical of Florida."

            "Imperfect Stage: For many species of Colletotrichum, reliance must be placed on conidial measurements, as the perfect stage occurs rarely or not at all. With spores as small and indistinct as those of Colletotrichum, even minor differences, while valid, are often difficult to demonstrate. Due to individual variability, overlapping between species is inevitable. As noted by Wollenweber and Hochapfel (1949), extreme values are of limited use when comparing spore measurements of Colletotrichum species unless accompanied by the mean, as the range is typically too broad to effectively delimit species. This is why many older descriptions are challenging to interpret.",
            "Since the perfect stage of this variety is encountered only rarely in Queensland, it is practical to have a distinguishing name for the conidial state as well. Wollenweber and Hochapfel consider the imperfect state of their G. cingulata var. minor to be Gloeosporium elasticae (Thlim.) Cke. & Mass., listing several synonyms, mainly species occurring on fig and coffee. The conidial measurements provided by Wollenweber and Hochapfel for this species fall within the range obtained for C. gloeosporioides var. minor in Queensland. Given the accepted synonymy of Gloeosporium with Colletotrichum, it would be unwise to continue using the former generic name. Unfortunately, Colletotrichum elasticae is already occupied by C. elasticae Tassi. Aside from the fact that a species name is not readily available, it seems preferable to designate the conidial state of a variety of G. cingulata as a variety of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides. Therefore, the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides Penz. var. minor var. nov. is proposed and is used in this article. A formal description will appear later.",

            "The first simplification in the design of our model concerns the role of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola clades (De Silva et al., 2017). However, perithecia rarely occur in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main type of inoculum in disease development. The model, therefore, focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, with asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli being regarded as the only inoculum responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics. Excluding a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein, 1963), potentially delaying epidemic growth (Schein, 1963), especially during rainless periods. This is because ascospores can be forcibly discharged from perithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity (Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).",

            "Strawberries (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).",
            "Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",

In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.",

            "In the traditional system of strawberry production, plants are grown in the ground, and crop rotation is essential. However, in recent cultivation systems, plants are continuously cultivated on elevated benches to improve production efficiency. This continuous cropping system usually increases weed populations and necessitates intensive herbicide applications, which can also enhance the risk of disease dissemination from weeds to strawberries. The present study demonstrated that an increase of C. fructicola in weeds heightened the incidence of anthracnose in strawberries during the following cultivation season. While there are numerous sources of C. fructicola that lead to disease during subsequent strawberry cultivations, the increase of pathogens on herbicide-treated weeds can be a significant source.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

Some believe the world would indeed be a dull place without strawberries to excite the taste buds and enliven desserts and pastries. Strawberry cultivation can be traced back thousands of years, with origins in Europe well documented in literature and art. Fragaria vesca L. (diploid, 2n=14 chromosomes) and F. moschata (hexaploid, 2n=42 chromosomes) were cultivated in palace and church gardens. Strawberry culture in the New World, particularly in North and South America, is less well documented. North American natives appreciated the springtime appearance of F. virginiana Duchesne (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) fruit, although this species was likely not cultivated until Europeans began exploring and settling in North America. However, native inhabitants of Chile and Peru had selected and cultivated superior variants of F. chiloensis (L.) Quebe- sene (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) well before the arrival of conquistadors in the 16th century."

Multiple sequence alignments were generated using ClustalX 2.0.10 (Larkin et al., 2007), treating gaps as missing data. Each of the single and combined sequence alignments was analyzed using maximum parsimony (MP) in PAUP* 4b10. Ambiguously aligned regions were excluded from all analyses. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with tree bisection-reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1000 random sequence additions. The maximum number of trees was unlimited; branches of zero length were collapsed, and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics, such as tree length (TL), consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI), were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. Clade stability of the trees resulting from the parsimony analyses was assessed through bootstrap analysis with 1000 replicates. Trees were visualized in Treeview. When analyzing ITS and \u03b2-tubulin sequences, some reference sequences were obtained from GenBank (Table 2). The model of evolution was estimated using MrModelTest 2.2 (Nylander, 2004). Posterior probabilities (PP) were determined using Markov Chain Monte Carlo sampling (BMCMC) in MrBayes 3.0b4 (Huelsenbeck and Ronquist, 2001). Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 3,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100 generations, resulting in 30,000 total trees. The first 2,000 trees, representing the burn-in phase of the analyses, were discarded, and the remaining 28,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities in the majority rule consensus tree.",
            "To determine whether the seven sequence datasets were congruent and combinable, we visually compared tree topologies based on 70% reciprocal Neighbour-Joining bootstrap with Maximum Likelihood distances (10,000 replicates). Substitution models for each partition were determined separately using MrModeltest v. 2.3 (Nylander 2004), following the methodology outlined by Mason-Gamer & Kellogg (1996). A maximum parsimony analysis was conducted on the multilocus alignment (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) using PAUP (Phylogenetic Analysis Using Parsimony) v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2000). The analysis employed a heuristic search option with 100 random sequence additions and tree bisection and reconstruction (TBR) as the branch-swapping algorithm. Alignment gaps were treated as missing data, and all characters were unordered and of equal weight. The robustness of the resulting trees was evaluated using 500 bootstrap replications with two random sequence additions (Hillis & Bull 1993). Tree length, consistency index (CI), retention index (RI), rescaled consistency index (RC), and homoplasy index (HI) were calculated for the resulting trees. A Markov Chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm was used to generate phylogenetic trees with Bayesian probabilities using MrBayes v. 3.1.1 (Ronquist & Huelsenbeck 2003) for the combined sequence datasets. Models of nucleotide substitution for each gene, as determined by MrModeltest v. 2.3, were applied to each gene partition. Two MCMC chains were run from random trees for one million generations, with sampling every 100 generations. The likelihood scores for the two runs were 2,730 and 2,170. Consequently, the first 2,450 trees (the average of both) were discarded as part of the burn-in phase, and posterior probabilities were determined from the remaining trees. Sequences derived from this study were deposited in GenBank, the alignment was submitted to TreeBASE (www.treebase.org), and taxonomic novelties were recorded in MycoBank (Crous et al. 2004a).",

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",

In the greenhouse, the number of naturally infected transplants killed was significantly reduced by all fungicides and the heat treatment (5 minutes at 49\u00b0C) compared to the non-treated control.

            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G.

Currently, it is registered in the United States as a biopesticide for use on mushroom beds and, more recently, as a postharvest treatment for stone fruit and citrus. Due to its unique mode of action and the fact that resistance has never been reported in filamentous fungi during its extensive use in the food industry (Aparicio et al., 2016), this fungicide could be valuable in strawberry production where QoI resistance has been reported in C. acutatum and where new rotational products are needed for dip treatments.",

In the literature, C. siamense has been most frequently reported in tropical and subtropical regions, while C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. karstii have been documented across a wide range of latitudes. Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting a pathogen's survival.

More research on the genetic and biological characteristics of different Colletotrichum species from diverse geographical areas is necessary to understand the emergence and spread of anthracnose diseases. With rising global temperatures, it will be particularly important to monitor the expansion of the heat-adapted C. siamense toward higher latitudes.",

However, it is clear that climate change and its effects on plant health will increasingly threaten human populations, especially those in poorer regions. We have demonstrated that reported observations of hundreds of pests and pathogens are consistent with the hypothesis of climate change drivers, as opposed to the hypothesis of enhanced detection capabilities in developed countries. While countries at higher latitudes are better equipped to monitor and manage emerging pests and diseases, they also tend to have the highest productivity per unit of land area, raising concerns about food security. If climate change facilitates the spread of crop-destroying organisms, there will be a renewed need to monitor pest and disease occurrences and control them effectively.",

            "Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes have been made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). However, the biological characteristics, such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum species, remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). High temperatures and their frequency can delay or even prevent the onset of plant diseases (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). Conversely, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature plays a vital role in disease emergence.",
            "The climate is subtropical, characterized by a higher annual average temperature. Latitude and elevation may play roles in influencing temperature variations, which in turn affect the geographic distribution of the Colletotrichum pathogens (Han et al. 2016). The host ranges of C. siamense and C. fructicola, the two most prevalent causal agents of strawberry crown rot, indicate that the vast majority of Colletotrichum fungi are not host-specific but can adapt to a wide range of hosts. This adaptability presents significant challenges in managing Colletotrichum species and mitigating their destructive effects in agricultural production. A comparative analysis of host ranges can partially reflect the prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields."

            "In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).",
            "Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.",
            "Morphological data is now recommended as an alternative method for accurate species identification in the genus Colletotrichum. Species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. amagnum, C. aorchidearum, C. boninense, C. dracae- nophilum, and C. gloeosporioides have been separated into various species using morphological and molecular techniques. However, in China, the identification of Colletotrichum species on mango has primarily relied on conidial morphology and ITS sequences. The combined data are still limited and insufficient to distinguish closely related taxa within the aforementioned species complexes. Previous research concerning Colletotrichum species on mango has mostly involved samples from small, fragmented provincial areas, resulting in poor representation of the actual species diversity in the vast mango-growing regions of China.",

            "Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",
            "Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998). Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).",
            "In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.",

            "The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, Thailand, based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data. A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the..."

Although we do not treat all names placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides or Glomerella cingulata by von Arx & M\u00fcller (1954) and von Arx (1957, 1970), we do include all names that have been suggested to have a close relationship with C. gloeosporioides in recent literature, along with all subspecific taxa and formae speciales within C. gloeosporioides and G. cingulata.",
            "The sexual stage of certain genetic subgroups of C. acutatum has been characterized under laboratory conditions and designated as Glomerella acutata. Research indicates that many isolates from diverse hosts can mate and form mature perithecia in culture. Crosses within isolates in group C, as well as some intergroup crosses, exhibit high fertility, while others show weak fertility or infertility. However, mating compatibility in C. acutatum and other Colletotrichum species is complex.",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides isolates are very similar to C. fragariae; however, they may form the Glomerella cingulata ascigerous state in culture, and their cylindrical conidia are usually rounded at both ends. Both C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides isolates produce dark black setae in acervuli in culture, as well as on lesions found on petioles, stolons, and fruits. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture is slower than that of the other two species, especially at higher temperatures. Identifying Colletotrichum species based solely on morphological and cultural characteristics is challenging due to the overlapping ranges of various traits. A number of molecular methods have been employed to differentiate these species, including arbitrary primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR), restriction fragment length polymorphisms (RFLPs) of PCR-amplified ribosomal DNA (rDNA), nucleotide sequences of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of rDNA, and species-specific primers based on the ITS regions (Freeman et al., 2000a; Lewis Ivey et al., 2004; Smith et al., 2007).",

Some of these taxa have been designated as separate species, such as C. fragariae (Johnston et al., 2008). The ITS region has a limited ability to discriminate clades within this group; hence, a more appropriate biomarker is required for barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding should have low heterogeneity within species, yet enough variation to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications. It is also important that the gene can be easily sequenced for all species and does not require specific primers for each group (Seifert, 2009; Gilmore et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009).",

            "In February 1999, it was reported that rotating with oats and fertilizing with NH4-N can suppress take-all disease in wheat. Our findings support the hypothesis that combining oat rotation with NH4-N fertilization can reduce root diseases in plants. Both oat cultivars suppressed black root rot under the (NH4)2SO4 regime but differed in their effects on the two main pathogens. Saia oats reduced the number of root lesion nematodes but did not affect root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. In contrast, Garry oats reduced root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. but did not affect the numbers of lesion nematodes. Furthermore, the Saia oat pre-crop increased early berry yield, whereas Garry oats had no significant effect. The yield increase following rotation with Saia oats may have been due to its unsuitability as a host for the lesion nematode, which, in these soils, may have been a more yield-reducing pathogen. In other experiments, we found that Saia oats were similar to Garry oats in reducing R. fragariae recovery from soil (14; J. A. LaMondia, unpublished research). Therefore, the failure of Garry oats to affect yield may be attributed to its high susceptibility to the lesion nematode. The resistance of Saia oats to the lesion nematode was first recognized by Colbran (3), who noted its utility in suppressing re-plant problems in apple orchards. Townsend (24) later demonstrated that Saia oats were resistant to Pratylenchus neglectus Rensch and P. penetrans. However, the resistance to the lesion nematode does not entirely explain the effects of Saia oats on disease and yield, as sorgho-sudangrass also reduced lesion nematodes but had no significant impact on disease severity or yield. The reduction in nematode densities by sorgho-sudangrass may have been insufficient to affect yield. Additionally, it is possible that oat straw residues have specific effects on the disease. Papavizas (18) reported that oat (presumably A. sativa) straw residues increased the number of antagonistic bacteria to R. solani and other fungal pathogens in soil. Since we did not examine antagonism, it is unclear whether the residues of Avena spp. act differently toward soil microbes compared to those of sorgho-sudangrass.",
            "Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 led to greater disease suppression and enhanced plant growth compared to Ca(NO3)2, though yield was not significantly affected. Past studies have shown that (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot and increased yield in strawberry (6) and suppressed root diseases in other crops (5, 10, 11). Fertilization with (NH4)2SO4 did not impact the recovery of Rhizoctonia spp. from roots but did increase root weight and the number of lesion nematodes. Since P. penetrans is an obligate parasite that must live in living roots, it is reasonable to find lower densities of this pathogen on roots of dead and declining strawberries, as evidenced in the Ca(NO3)2-treated plants, compared to healthier plants treated with (NH4)2SO4.",
            "Abstract: This study evaluates how host nutritional variables affect the severity of crown and root rot in tomatoes caused by Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici. Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.",
            "Compared to Ca(NO3)2, the (NH4)2SO4 treatment reduced the percentage of blackened roots. The influence of the cover crops on growth and disease was more pronounced with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization than with Ca(NO3)2. Combining \u2018Saia\u2019 oats or sorgho-sudangrass rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization led to a reduction in lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) numbers in subsequent strawberry roots compared to controls. Furthermore, the combination of \u2018Saia\u2019 or \u2018Garry\u2019 oats as a precrop with applications of (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot severity relative to controls. Only the \u2018Garry\u2019 oat rotation reduced strawberry root colonization by Rhizoctonia fragariae when compared to controls. Additional effects associated with (NH4)2SO4 treatment included a decrease in rhizosphere soil pH by 0.2 units, a reduction in fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere by 10- to 15-fold, and leaves with higher concentrations of nitrogen, potassium, sulfur, manganese, and zinc compared to plants treated with Ca(NO3)2. Therefore, rotation with \u2018Saia\u2019 oats combined with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization may suppress strawberry black root rot and enhance yields through multiple effects on the host, pathogens, and associated microflora.",

            "The form of nitrogen significantly influenced both the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and the growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg\u00b7L\u20131).",

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum.

            "The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).",

            "Considerable progress has been made in recent years in delineating anthracnose diseases and their causal agents. Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",
            "Some host plants appear to be particularly susceptible to infection by multiple Colletotrichum taxa. The occurrence of species on strawberry has been well researched due to the former status of C. acutatum as a regulated quarantine pathogen. We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.",

Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato (s.l.) is considered the second most economically important pathogen worldwide affecting strawberries. A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This study highlights the genetic and pathogenic heterogeneity of the C. acutatum s.l. populations introduced into the UK linked to strawberry production.",

Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010).

            "Molecular tools are increasingly being utilized for day-to-day identification by biosecurity officers and plant pathology researchers, highlighting the need for a taxonomy that accurately reflects genetically resolved groups, along with simple and reliable protocols for identifying those taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable. Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti, and some others.",
            "The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.",

Cannon et al.

            "Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1\u03b1) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes.

            "For phylogenetic classification, genomic DNA was extracted from fungal isolates grown on PDA using a modified CTAB extraction protocol. The ITS, ACT, CHS-1, and GAPDH gene regions were amplified using established methods. DNA sequencing was performed on an ABI PRISM 3730XL analyzer at Macrogen (Seoul, Korea). Each sequence was assembled and proofread using MEGA v.7. The sequences generated in this study were deposited in GenBank (PP839268-PP839270 for ITS, PP908669-PP908671 for ACT, PP908672-PP908674 for CHS-1, PP908675-PP908677 for GAPDH). Multiple alignments were conducted using MAFFT ver. 7. Maximum likelihood phylogenetic analyses were carried out using RAxML on the CIPRES web portal with the GTR+G model and 1,000 bootstrap replicates. The phylogenetic analysis revealed that three isolates formed a monophyletic group with C. nymphaeae CBS 515.78 (ex-type), CBS 526.77, CBS 129936, and CBS 126366, with bootstrap support of 89%.",

In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California. Freeman and Katan (7) also observed identical RAPD patterns in pathogen isolates from both countries, suggesting that C. acutatum was introduced from the United States into Israel.",

The ITS sequences generated indicated that the isolates from guava and strawberry in Brazil belong to the same major clade as C. guajavae. The ITS sequence is identical to that of C. guajavae, yet it matches several other species within this complex, making precise identification impossible without further information. A phylogenetic analysis from combined GAPDH and GS sequences in the study by Guerber et al.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Rain splash is the primary means by which conidia of Colletotrichum spp. spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduces the amount of rain penetrating the plant canopy, thereby decreasing splash. Most fruit infections occur within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997).",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan. We hypothesized that various weeds growing in and around strawberry fields serve as inoculum sources for this disease. Additionally, we investigated the effect of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on these weeds.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",
            "During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017). In pathogenicity tests, all C. nymphaeae isolates were able to...",

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",

            "Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].",
            "Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",
            "This study evaluated the fungicides prochloraz-Zn, prochloraz-Mn (both protectant sterol-biosynthesis inhibitors), captan, folpet, a combined formulation of prochloraz-Zn and folpet, propiconazole, difenoconazole, and a heat treatment for the control of C. acutatum in naturally infected strawberry plants under laboratory, greenhouse, and field conditions. Fungicides were applied at the transplant stage to determine whether a single-dip treatment is sufficient for disease control.",
            "Control of C. acutatum in Infected Strawberry Transplants in the Greenhouse: Mortality of transplants caused by C. acutatum was significantly reduced by all fungicides and heat treatment compared to the non-treated control. Prochloraz-Zn was the most effective treatment, achieving 85.6% control, though it did not differ significantly from heat treatment, which achieved 75.6% control. Other treatments, including prochloraz-Zn/folpet (50.6% control), propiconazole (33.8% control), and difenoconazole (28.8% control), were less effective than prochloraz-Zn and heat treatment. It's important to note that prochloraz fungicides, along with difenoconazole and propiconazole, caused slight phytotoxicity in the treated plants, evidenced by mild stunting and leaf scorching.",
            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",
            "ABSTRACT: Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae, is a serious problem in the southeastern United States, resulting in significant losses in strawberry nurseries. Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.",
            "Control of Colletotrichum acutatum is highly dependent on frequent applications of both multi-site and single-site fungicides (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). Multi-site fungicides, such as captan, provide satisfactory control of C. acutatum, but they lack a curative effect, necessitating weekly applications throughout the season (Mertely et al. 2017b). Single-site fungicides, particularly the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), exhibit a post-infection effect on anthracnose; however, growers are limited in the number of applications permitted during the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Given the limited QoI applications allowed during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multi-site fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. Nevertheless, to ensure symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have frequently been used in nurseries, resulting in the selection of fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another significant strawberry pathogen (Oliveira et al. 2017).",
            "Control of C. acutatum in Field Transplants: In field trials conducted in 1995 and 1996, mortality caused by C. acutatum in naturally infected strawberry transplants was significantly reduced by all fungicide treatments compared to the non-treated control. Prochloraz-Mn and prochloraz-Zn were the most effective in reducing transplant mortality. In 1995, prochloraz-Mn reduced mortality by 93.3%, while in 1996, reductions were 86.8% for prochloraz-Mn and 93.1% for prochloraz-Zn, with no significant differences between them. Prochloraz-Zn/folpet, propiconazole, and difenoconazole were less effective than prochloraz alone. In 1995, transplant mortality was reduced by 66.7% and 37.7% with prochloraz-Zn/folpet and propiconazole, respectively. In 1996, reductions were 52.9% and 29.1% with prochloraz-Zn/folpet and difenoconazole, respectively. Similar to the greenhouse experiments, prochloraz fungicides, difenoconazole, and propiconazole exhibited slight phytotoxicity.",

            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",

            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.",
            "The application of fungicides is a common practice to control anthracnose in mango orchards in Thailand, but it often proves unsuccessful. This ineffectiveness may stem from the emergence of new Colletotrichum species and/or the development of fungicide resistance among the pathogens.",

            "Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.",
            "In Korea, strawberries (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) are favored for winter cultivation when the production of other vegetables and fruits is relatively low. In 2003, strawberries were planted on a total area of 7,503 hectares in Korea, with plastic greenhouse cultivation comprising 7,172 hectares and a total production of 205,427 tonnes for the fresh market (Anonymous, 2004). Forcing, where strawberries are transplanted into greenhouses in mid-September and induced to fruit in December (Oda, 1991), is becoming more common in Korea. June-bearing cultivars such as Maehyang, Akihime, and Nyoho, used for forcing, have proven difficult to grow due to their susceptibility to anthracnose (Nam et al., 1998; Kim & Nam, 1999). Anthracnose is one of the most damaging diseases of strawberries, causing wilting and death of transplants in the nursery field. The pathogen responsible for the disease in Korea is Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, first reported in 1992 (Kim et al., 1992).",
            "Treatments were evaluated as dips for transplants because planting material is a primary source of introducing Colletotrichum acutatum into a field. Currently, dip treatments for transplants are a common practice in California for establishing new strawberry fields. Our results showed that plant mortality was significantly reduced by natamycin and fludioxonil-cyprodinil when transplants were inoculated with both QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. Under highly favorable disease conditions, additional foliar treatments will need to be applied to protect plants from petiole and leaf lesions, as well as fruit rot throughout the season. These treatments can be integrated with those for managing gray mold caused by Botrytis spp.",
            "While C. acutatum infections are frequently observed in strawberry production fields, it has been suggested that quiescently infected transplants from nurseries serve as the primary inoculum source for field infections (Howard et al. 1992; Peres et al. 2005). In Florida, strawberries are treated as annual crops and are cultivated throughout the winter. However, during the hot summer months, extreme temperatures negatively impact the survival of C. acutatum in soil and plant debris (Ure\u00f1a-Padilla et al. 2001).",
            "Because the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appeared to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised, after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s, to obtain their transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, which were believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. More recently, C. acutatum has been found in some nurseries in these areas. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants can be produced in the southeastern United States by locating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants remain the primary control method for anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.",

(1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.",
            "Since the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields is infected transplants, planting disease-free plants is the best control method. However, obtaining anthracnose-free plants has become more challenging as the geographic range of the causal pathogens has expanded to most areas where strawberry plants are produced. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern U.S., where the pathogens are endemic, by locating plant production nurseries away from commercial fruit production fields.",
            "Two trials were conducted using the strawberry cultivars Portola and Fronteras (trial 1) or Monterey and Fronteras (trial 2). Bare-root transplants were obtained from two nurseries and dipped for 4 minutes with agitation in an aqueous conidial suspension (10^6 conidia/ml) of a mixture containing four QoI-sensitive and four QoI-resistant isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum.",
            "Abundant anthracnose infestation was evident in many nurseries during the summers of 1995 and 1996, resulting in a massive collapse of transplants in soil-fumigated fields. Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel indicated that populations of C. acutatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable levels (S. Freeman, unpublished data). Therefore, the likelihood of persistent soil contamination by a soilborne inoculum of C. acutatum appears low, especially since soil fumigation is a standard practice.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear."

The exclusive presence of a MAT1-2 homolog in all species studied here supports the idea that the genetic control of sexual reproduction in this genus does not conform to any known system in the entire fungal kingdom (Rodr\u00edguez-Guerra et al. 2005; Crouch and Beirn 2009).",

These papers often discussed morphological similarities among fungi from different hosts; however, the breadth of these similarities became of little practical use to plant pathologists. They provided minimal information regarding pathogenicity, host range, or other attributes of the Colletotrichum species described. The studies by von Arx & M\u00fcller (1954) and von Arx (1957) did not rely on direct examination of type material for all species, leading to questions about whether the species in question were indeed distinct.

Unlike DNA-based methods, tests based on VCG and sexual crosses require living fungi. Consequently, strains that are compared may need to be moved from one location to another. Within species, multiple genotypes of Colletotrichum acutatum exist, with isolates appearing on various hosts.

Combining \u2018Saia\u2019 oats or sorgho-sudangrass rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization led to a reduction in lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) numbers in subsequent strawberry roots compared to controls. Furthermore, the combination of \u2018Saia\u2019 or \u2018Garry\u2019 oats as a precrop with applications of (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot severity relative to controls.

Additional effects associated with (NH4)2SO4 treatment included a decrease in rhizosphere soil pH by 0.2 units, a reduction in fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere by 10- to 15-fold, and leaves with higher concentrations of nitrogen, potassium, sulfur, manganese, and zinc compared to plants treated with Ca(NO3)2. Therefore, rotation with \u2018Saia\u2019 oats combined with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization may suppress strawberry black root rot and enhance yields through multiple effects on the host, pathogens, and associated microflora.",

            "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum species, is a serious disease affecting over 30 plant genera. Several DNA phylogenetic studies have identified Colletotrichum species that infect chili in various countries. Despite China being the largest producer of chili, with significant multi-gene analysis, little is known about the species affecting local crops. In this study, samples of diseased chili were collected from 29 provinces in China, resulting in the isolation of 1,285 strains. We observed and compared the morphological characteristics of all strains, and performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and HIS3) on selected representative strains. Fifteen Colletotrichum species were identified, with C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum being the most prevalent. Additionally, three new species, C. conoides, C. grossum, and C. liaoningense, are described in this paper. Colletotrichum aenigma, C. cliviae, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, C. incanum, C. karstii, and C. viniferum were reported for the first time in chili. Pathogenicity was confirmed for all species isolated from chili, except for C. endophytica.

Most isolates, such as ZJE-3, exhibited strong pathogenicity on wounded leaves but weak pathogenicity on non-wounded leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) to identify 91 different isolates from strawberry anthracnose samples. The species identified were C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, all belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, where it was found to be the second most common species. Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth.

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems."

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions.

With repeated cycles of infection on sweet orange flowers, post-bloom fruit drop of citrus can spread over large areas in a single season. On citrus, environmental factors, amounts of inoculum, and other factors affecting the epidemiology of post-bloom fruit drop have been used to develop models to predict disease and forecast the need for fungicide applications.",
            "The occurrence of strawberry anthracnose in Nara and Chiba prefectures has been documented in various studies (et al. 2004; Peres et al. 2005; Van Hemelrijcka et al. 2010). This disease was widespread in western Japan during the late 1970s (Gan et al. 2017). The pathogen Colletotrichum fructicola, along with other anthracnose pathogens, primarily infects nurseries and can latently infect runner plantlets, leading to the transmission of the disease from nurseries to production fields (Hirayama et al. 2016; Okayama and Tsujimoto 1994). Most commonly grown strawberry cultivars are susceptible (Mori 1998), and the rise of fungicide-resistant strains complicates disease control (Inada et al. 2015). Therefore, eradicating the pathogen from nurseries is crucial to preventing disease incidence.",
            "In a related study, the severity of anthracnose fruit rot, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, was also reduced with the application of Ca(NO3)2 on greenhouse-grown strawberries. Similar findings were reported regarding the control of Fusarium diseases in tomatoes and chrysanthemums. Notably, there was a significant variation in foliar N levels among different strawberry clones, suggesting that N applications should be customized for each cultivar. Nonetheless, the trend of decreased anthracnose severity with nitrate fertilizers was consistent across five strawberry clones tested, indicating that other cultivars may respond similarly.",
            "Discussion: The spread of anthracnose fruit rot was observed in strawberry plots over two years by determining disease gradients in relation to the distance from introduced point sources of Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum. Disease spread was strongly influenced by the canopy, as evidenced by the significant effect of canopy row side (relative to the inoculum source) and plant density treatment on the height and steepness of the disease gradients. The near side overall exhibited a higher disease incidence than the far row side, and there was generally a negative but nonlinear relationship between plant density and disease incidence.",
            "ABSTRACT: Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae, is a serious problem in the southeastern United States, resulting in significant losses in strawberry nurseries. Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.",
            "The nutritional status of a plant significantly impacts its susceptibility to disease, a principle that has been utilized to reduce disease severity (Huber & Watson, 1974; Engelhard, 1989; Huber & McCay-Buis, 1993). Little is currently known about the influence of plant nutrition on strawberry anthracnose. This study aims to investigate the effects of the concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium on the development of strawberry anthracnose, with the goal of developing practical disease management strategies.",
            "Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season."

            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",
            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",
            "Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes have been made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). However, the biological characteristics, such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum species, remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). High temperatures and their frequency can delay or even prevent the onset of plant diseases (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). Conversely, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature plays a vital role in disease emergence.",
            "Some host plants appear to be particularly susceptible to infection by multiple Colletotrichum taxa. The occurrence of species on strawberry has been well researched due to the former status of C. acutatum as a regulated quarantine pathogen. We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.",
            "Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).",
            "Results from several studies suggest that Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. In one of these studies (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Results based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence of two subgroups within C. acutatum. The first subgroup, characterized as CA-clonal, included only isolates from strawberries and exhibited identical RAPD patterns along with nearly identical ITS2 sequence analyses. A larger genetic group, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts and displayed variable RAPD patterns and divergent ITS2 sequence analyses. Based on these molecular data, Denoyes-Rothan et al. (2002) proposed that the CA-clonal subgroup contained closely related, highly virulent C. acutatum isolates that may have developed host specialization to strawberries. Isolates of Colletotrichum species have been disseminated worldwide, likely through international plant exchanges, as their genetic polymorphism and geographical origins are not correlated (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005).",
            "The perceived lack of host specificity in the C. acutatum complex likely has multiple causes, but a significant issue stems from inadequate identification practices in pathology studies. Many investigations still avoid including sequence-based evidence or rely solely on ITS sequences, with only a few depositing adequate voucher material. This leads to less rigorous name usage than is necessary, resulting in misleading outcomes and poor comparability between studies. It must be acknowledged that many, if not most, of the species recognized through multigene analyses do not seem to be restricted to particular plants."

In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts.

In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished).

            "Abstract: Colletotrichum fructicola is a major causal agent of anthracnose in strawberries in Nara, Japan. We hypothesized that various weeds growing in and around strawberry fields serve as inoculum sources for this disease. Additionally, we investigated the effect of herbicide treatment on C. fructicola sporulation on these weeds.",
            "C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.",
            "The experiment assessed the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum fructicola on various weed species and its influence on strawberry plants. It was found that C. fructicola is not pathogenic on strawberries. Among the weed species tested, Amaranthus blitum exhibited the highest infection rate, with 17.9% affected by C. fructicola (see Table 2). Other weeds, such as Digitaria ciliaris, Galinsoga ciliata, Solidago altissima, Erigeron annuus, and Sonchus oleraceus, showed relatively low detection rates (4.3% to 8.1%) without displaying symptoms. Notably, C. fructicola was not isolated from the remaining seven weed species, which included Senecio vulgaris, Cyperus microiria, Lamium amplexicaule, Portulaca oleracea, Alopecurus aequalis, Capsella bursa-pastoris, and Cerastium glomeratum. The fungus was isolated more frequently from warm-season weeds compared to cool-season ones (refer to Table 2).",
            "Inoculation tests with C. fructicola suggested that the pathogen can survive latently on most weeds. Colletotrichum acutatum, another anthracnose pathogen affecting strawberries, invades the intercellular spaces of infected plant tissues. The fungus produces secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves, increasing the conidial count three-fold. Similarly, C. fructicola may produce additional conidia during latent infections in weeds. The pathogen's increase in strawberry fields can go unnoticed, as latently infected weeds are often difficult to detect visually. Strawberry growers have not observed symptoms on control plants sprayed with sterile water.",
            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",

            "Based on published data, we discussed the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in China. C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex are currently the most prevalent. The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift in the prevailing Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in various regions may be linked to global warming, changes in cultivation patterns\u2014from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation\u2014and the substitution of strawberry varieties.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Overall, the study found that the presence of C. fructicola on weeds increased the likelihood of disease in strawberries during subsequent cultivation seasons. All isolates tested positive for typical disease symptoms on strawberry plants, while control plants remained symptom-free.",
            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions."

            "Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",

Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases.

            "Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",
            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",
            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).",
            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",
            "Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action. Natural products have also been evaluated as alternative fungicides, offering different modes of action, lower toxicity, and increased efficacy (Abril et al., 2008).",

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",

            "Abstract: Although hydroponic techniques enable intensive and effective crop management, controlling watering for each crop type and growth stage is challenging with commonly used timed watering systems. This often results in excessive or insufficient watering. Hydroponic technology that considers drainage rates can minimize drainage amounts, thereby reducing environmental pollution and fertilizer consumption. This study compared drainage rates and timed watering methods in a strawberry hydroponic system to determine the optimal drainage rate. As the drainage rate increased, the amount of water supplied also increased. A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. The drainage electrical conductivity (EC) level was highest in the 10% drainage rate group. In the 20% drainage rate treatment, leaf length and width increased compared to the four applications of the timer-supplying method. The yield of fruits weighing more than 27 g was highest in the 20% drainage rate treatment, indicating it was the most appropriate. We propose that it is possible to reduce unnecessary fertilizer consumption and increase productivity by managing water supply through drainage rates for precise water supply management in strawberries.",

One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides.

Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

            "Many of the species recognized in this work remain poorly understood in terms of their pathogenicity and host preference. This is partly due to a lack of certainty about the biological relationships between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

Most isolates, such as ZJE-3, exhibited strong pathogenicity on wounded leaves but weak pathogenicity on non-wounded leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) to identify 91 different isolates from strawberry anthracnose samples. The species identified were C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, all belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, where it was found to be the second most common species. Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth. Different colony types were observed, with a generally grayish-white appearance and slow hyphal growth under the tested culture conditions. The pathogenicity varied among C. siamense isolates, indicating a need for further research on their pathogenesis.",

            "Several species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum cause anthracnose in strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.), a major disease affecting this crop. The principal pathogens known to be responsible for the disease are C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",
            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems.",

In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986).

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots.

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach."

Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990).

While countries at higher latitudes are better equipped to monitor and manage emerging pests and diseases, they also tend to have the highest productivity per unit of land area, raising concerns about food security.

Millipore-filtered bi-distilled water (0.05 mm, Elgastat Ultra High Polishing unit, O. Kleiner AG, Wohlen, Switzerland) was added as needed to maintain a solution level of 1 to 2 cm. Fourteen days after planting, tomato seedlings were carefully removed from the rock wool with the upper 1.5 cm of the root system intact. They were weighed, and disease severity was rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (adapted from Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990), where 0 = symptomless; 1 = slight brown discoloration of the upper root system; 2 = moderate brown discoloration affecting two-thirds or less of the upper root system; 3 = extreme brown discoloration of the upper root system with numerous necrotic lesions extending up the crown and stem; and 4 = seedling dead or nearly dead.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "In contrast, there was no difference in infection and colonization by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants and the wild type on wounded fruit, suggesting that cutinase no longer played an important role in cell infection after the cuticle was penetrated. Hence, there was no disadvantage to the F8-3B-pAA1 transformants having reduced expression of cutinase once they had infected the pericarp tissue. These results were consistent with previously reported work demonstrating that the C. capsici pathotype F8-3B was able to infect chili fruits when wound inoculation was applied. If the hypothesis is that cutinase assists with the penetration of the fungal pathogen, then the wound inoculation method is unlikely to demonstrate the function of the gene since the host's first layer of defense (cuticle and epidermis) has been disrupted.",
            "The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.",
            "Cutinase has been proposed as the hydrolyzing agent of the plant cuticle and/or an elicitor of cutin monomers, which trigger signaling pathways within fungal pathogens. Despite the identification of cutinase in various Colletotrichum species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. trifolii, C. lagenarium, and C. capsici, the characterization of the gene and its function in the C. truncatum-chili interaction remains unexplored.",
            "Auyong et al. (2015) investigated the role of cutinase and its impact on the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum truncatum (Journal of Plant Pathology and Microbiology 6:259-269). Mongkolporn et al. (2010) documented differential reactions on mature green and ripe chili fruit infected by three Colletotrichum species (Plant Disease 94:306-310). Mongkolporn and Taylor (2018) provided an overview of chili anthracnose, discussing Colletotrichum taxonomy and pathogenicity (Plant Pathology 67:1255-1263).",
            "To achieve successful pathogenicity, fungi employ various infection strategies to breach the host cuticle. Some pathogens utilize mechanical means through specialized infection structures, while others penetrate the cuticle directly with the assistance of extracellular cutinase activity. Colletotrichum truncatum, a pathogen of legumes, cereals, grasses, and vegetable crops such as Capsicum species, is an ascomycete that infects its host through direct penetration of the host cuticle. The infection and penetration process is believed to be triggered by cutin-degrading enzymes such as cutinase. Numerous cutinases have been isolated and characterized from different fungi. These enzymes are suggested to play roles in carbon acquisition for saprophytic growth, as well as in fungal penetration and surface adhesion.",
            "Pathogenicity tests of Colletotrichum spp. from chili revealed that, while all species were pathogenic on chili fruits after wounding the surface, most produced a low level of infection on non-wounded fruit. This illustrates the importance of the cuticle acting as a barrier to infection by Colletotrichum spp. (Auyong et al. 2015) and emphasizes the need for informed and standardized inoculation techniques in pathogenicity assays. Some species, such as C. tropicale, C. makassarense, and C. plurivorum, which exhibited low infection levels in the assays on non-wounded fruit, may have a predominantly endophytic lifestyle and then switch to a necrotrophic lifestyle to complete their life cycle (De Silva et al. 2017b). However, further pathogenicity tests on different chili cultivars and at varying fruit maturity stages are necessary to comprehensively evaluate their pathogenicity. Pathogenicity testing of C. plurivorum on chili leaves and fruits showed that isolates collected from Chiang Rai and Malaysia could infect leaves but not fruits (results not shown), suggesting they might be specialized leaf pathogens. In contrast, two isolates of C. plurivorum from Bangkok did not infect leaves but did infect wounded fruits, demonstrating the pathogenic variation that can exist within a single species.",
            "The reduced level of cutinase expression in the transformants may have interrupted or delayed pathogen recognition of the host surface, resulting in the formation of a lower number of appressoria. Cutinase may be required to stimulate a host reaction, which is then recognized by the pathogen to initiate appressoria formation and penetration. Therefore, the inability of the pathogen to express the effector (cutinase) may have led to poor infection rates. Deising et al. reported that cutinase was involved in the adhesion of Uromyces viciae uredospores to the host cuticle. In another report, Woloshuk and Kolattukudy indicated that the expression of cutinase from spores of Fusarium solani was triggered upon contact with the plant cuticle. Indeed, Li et al. reported that low levels of cutinase present in the saprophytic phase of F. pisi f. sp. pisi were essential to induce higher levels of cutinase expression during infection of the fungus to penetrate its host. Since the endogenous cutinase in these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants was suppressed, the regulation of normal cutinase activity was affected. Whether this abnormal regulation of cutinase activity occurred due to its inability to secrete sufficient levels of cutinase initially to induce cutin monomers from the host or from a failure of the pathogen to detect the host cutin monomers remains unknown.",

            "Chilli pepper fruits with blemishes have reduced marketability (Manandhar et al., 1995). Colletotrichum spp. are among the most significant plant pathogens globally, causing the economically important disease anthracnose in a wide range of hosts, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and tree fruits (Bailey & Jeger, 1992). Among these hosts, Capsicum annuum is considered the most important vegetable in Thailand (Poulos, 2002) and is severely infected by anthracnose, with yield losses of up to 50% (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). Typical anthracnose symptoms on chilli fruits include sunken necrotic tissues with concentric rings of acervuli. Accurate taxonomic identification is crucial for plant breeding and disease management (Freeman et al., 1998). Traditionally, identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species were based on morphological characteristics such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence of setae or a teleomorph, and cultural characteristics like colony morphology.",
            "The current study aims to investigate the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili (Capsicum spp.) in China through large-scale sampling and isolation, alongside morphological characterization and multi-locus phylogeny of the isolated strains. Chili is an important vegetable crop globally, with China having the largest cultivated area, producing over 28 million tons annually for domestic consumption and export (Li et al. 2009). Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is one of the most destructive diseases limiting chili production, resulting in yield losses of up to 40% in China (Lin et al. 2004).",
            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).",
            "Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, causing disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum, each with a brief description. In recent years, molecular tools have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Some species have been segregated from the C. gloeosporioides complex based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, such as C. boninense.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum is a commonly reported species that causes anthracnose on numerous plants worldwide (Damm et al. 2012a). It was originally described from Carica papaya, Capsicum frutescens, and Delphinium ajacis in Australia (Simmonds 1965) but has since been reported to infect chili in almost all pepper-growing countries, such as Australia, China, India, Korea, New Zealand, Thailand, and the USA (Than et al. 2008).

(teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). Infections of mother plants with C. acutatum, which develop into bud and eventually crown rot, lead to the collapse and death of the plant. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons, girdling the runners and resulting in the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesions. The related pathogens C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae cause symptoms similar to those caused by C. acutatum. Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical anthracnose symptoms manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot. Considerable yield loss can occur under appropriate environmental and cultural conditions.",

This result confirmed that these three Colletotrichum species are causal agents of anthracnose infection in chilli. Additionally, the non-infection of the resistant genotype C. chinense PBC 932 by C. capsici and C. gloeosporioides reaffirmed the importance of this resistance in the interspecific breeding program (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). The anthracnose symptoms produced by all three isolates of C. acutatum in wound-inoculated fruits of PBC 932 indicated that C. acutatum was pathogenic and could overcome the resistance.",

Additionally, this is the first report of C. fructicola infecting chili in Thailand and Taiwan. All three novel species are new additions to the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili. More surveys in countries in Asia and Oceania are needed to identify the diversity and prevalence of species causing chili anthracnose.

            "Numerous Colletotrichum species within these complexes are reported to cause anthracnose. Some species are known to infect specific hosts, while others can infect multiple hosts. Anthracnose pathogens capable of infecting multiple hosts may indicate the development of cross-infection abilities. Based on a cross-pathogenicity study by Phoulivong et al. (2012), several species within the C. gloeosporioides complex were found to have the capacity to infect multiple hosts. For example, C. asianum was detected in infected chili, mango, and rose apple, while C. fructicola, originally reported to infect coffee berries, is now recognized as a phytopathogen affecting other plant species such as chili, citrus fruits, rose apple, avocado, grapes, and papaya.",
            "Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013).

            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in various fruit and vegetable crops worldwide. The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",

            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",
            "Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).",

Colletotrichum spp. are among the most significant plant pathogens globally, causing the economically important disease anthracnose in a wide range of hosts, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and tree fruits (Bailey & Jeger, 1992). Among these hosts, Capsicum annuum is considered the most important vegetable in Thailand (Poulos, 2002) and is severely infected by anthracnose, with yield losses of up to 50% (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). Typical anthracnose symptoms on chilli fruits include sunken necrotic tissues with concentric rings of acervuli. Accurate taxonomic identification is crucial for plant breeding and disease management (Freeman et al., 1998). Traditionally, identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species were based on morphological characteristics such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence of setae or a teleomorph, and cultural characteristics like colony morphology.",

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum spp., is a serious disease affecting strawberries. The etiology of anthracnose in strawberries is complex, with several Colletotrichum species identified as causal agents. In this study, multilocus phylogenetic analysis (utilizing genes such as actin, \u03b2-tubulin, calmodulin, glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase, and chitin synthase) revealed that 100 isolates of Colletotrichum associated with anthracnose of strawberry in central China belong to five species. Specifically, 97 isolates were identified as belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, with the distribution as follows: C. murrayae (81%), C. gloeosporioides (8%), C. fructicola (4%), and C. aenigma (4%).

Colletotrichum phormii can be distinguished from the closely related C. salicis (and indeed from all other species in the C. acutatum complex) by its elongate, large conidia and large appressoria. The species appears to be host-specific to Phormium spp. Recently, Takeuchi & Hori (2006) reported C. gloeosporioides from Phormium in Japan. However, based on dimensions of conidia (10\u201316.5 \u00d7 4\u20136 \u00b5m) and appressoria (7\u201317 \u00d7 4\u201311.5 \u00b5m) and the shape of the conidia\u2014cylindrical with broadly rounded ends (see fig. 3 of that paper)\u2014the fungus seems to belong to the C. gloeosporioides complex rather than one of the two C. acutatum complex members from Phormium treated in this study.",

Recent phylogenetic research utilizing a wider range of genes has been employed to study the C. gloeosporioides aggregate from strawberry (Johnston, in litt.) and supports the findings of MacKenzie et al. (2007), indicating that C. fragariae is distinguishable from the rest of the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, but is not restricted to strawberries. A drawback of most of the above studies is that the strains used were not compared with the type species. Recently, C. gloeosporioides has been epitypified, and multigene loci have been sequenced for this epitype.

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",

For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20 species. Several Colletotrichum species capable of causing strawberry anthracnose in temperate regions have been reported; however, knowledge of the composition of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions remains limited.",

Previous classifications based on morphology and host range have been found to be likely incorrect or less definitive (Ko Ko et al., 2011).

Although almond and avocado crops are grown in close proximity in Israel, where anthracnose from C. gloeosporioides affects both crops during the spring season, it remains uncertain whether cross-infection occurs in the field.

            "Abstract: Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is one of the major problems in mango production worldwide, including Thailand. All mango cultivars are susceptible, but Nam Dok Mai See Thong (NDMST) is the most vulnerable. Through a single spore isolation method, a total of 37 isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from NDMST showing anthracnose symptoms. Identification was performed using a combination of morphological characteristics, Koch\u2019s postulates, and phylogenetic analysis. The pathogenicity assay and Koch\u2019s postulates on leaves and fruit confirmed that all Colletotrichum spp. tested were causal agents of mango anthracnose. Multilocus analysis using DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2), actin (ACT), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) was performed for molecular identification. Two concatenated phylogenetic trees were constructed using either two loci (ITS and TUB2) or four loci (ITS, TUB2, ACT, and CHS-1). Both phylogenetic trees were indistinguishable and showed that these 37 isolates belong to C. acutatum, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. siamense. Our results indicated that using at least two loci of ITS and TUB2 was sufficient to infer Colletotrichum species complexes. Of the 37 isolates, C. gloeosporioides was the most dominant species (19 isolates), followed by C. asianum (10 isolates), C. acutatum (5 isolates), and C. siamense (3 isolates). In Thailand, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been reported to cause anthracnose in mango; however, this is the first report of C. asianum and C. siamense associated with mango anthracnose in central Thailand.",

            "A cultivar-by-isolate interaction for resistance has been demonstrated for Colletotrichum acutatum (15). A single dominant gene (Rca2) appears to be responsible for this interaction (16) and distinguishes two groups of C. acutatum: those producing a non-compatible reaction with cultivars having Rca2 (group 2) and those having an intermediate degree of compatibility with cultivars possessing the Rca2 gene (group 1) (15). Although C. acutatum is more distantly related to C. gloeosporioides than to C. fragariae (35) and produces different disease symptoms on strawberry (27), there is evidence that resistance to C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and G. cingulata is correlated (34). Cultivars that are at least moderately resistant to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum examined in the current study include 'Sweet Charlie' (8), 'Carmine' (10), and 'Earlibrite' (C. K. Chandler, unpublished). 'Sweet Charlie' is field immune to fruit rot, whereas 'Carmine' and 'Earlibrite' are moderately resistant. Although the mechanism of resistance to C. acutatum in these cultivars has not been examined, it is likely that they possess at least one copy of a dominant resistance gene against group 2 C. acutatum isolates. A dominant resistance gene to this group of isolates was found in 13 of 14 cultivars from the United States and Europe classified as intermediately susceptible or resistant to anthracnose fruit rot, whereas it occurred in only one of seven cultivars classified as susceptible (16). Additionally, cultivars such as 'Dover', which is homozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), and 'Sequoia', which is heterozygous for the Rca2 gene (16), are present in the pedigrees of the three fruit rot-resistant cultivars used in the current study (9\u201311). With the exception of 'Treasure', no cultivar displayed significantly greater resistance to crown rot than 'Sweet Charlie', 'Earlibrite', and 'Carmine', suggesting that major gene resistance to C. acutatum could also be effective against C. gloeosporioides. The lack of a cultivar-by-isolate interaction observed with isolates of C. gloeosporioides could be due to little variation in a gene product or products in this species that are homologous to those responsible for the interaction with C. acutatum. Also important is the fact that 'Treasure' was found to be highly susceptible to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum in field trials conducted over two years (C. K. Chandler, unpublished), indicating that genes responsible for resistance to crown rot caused by C. gloeosporioides do not necessarily confer resistance to C. acutatum.",

            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",
            "The main objective of this study was to investigate the genetic diversity and pathogenicity of a large representative population of Colletotrichum acutatum isolated from strawberries, comprising 62 isolates primarily from Europe and the United States. Results based on RAPD (Random Amplified Polymorphic DNA) and ITS2 (Internal Transcribed Spacer 2) sequence analyses provide clear genetic evidence of at least two well-characterized groups among the tested C. acutatum isolates from strawberries. The subgroup CA-clonal was homogeneous, containing isolates exclusively from strawberries that exhibited identical RAPD patterns and nearly identical ITS2 sequence data. The other, larger genetic subgroup, CA-variable, included isolates from various hosts, including strawberries, that exhibited variable RAPD patterns and ITS2 sequences. These two main subgroups were well supported by bootstrap analysis of RAPD markers and sequence phylogeny."

            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.",

Additionally, this is the first report of C. fructicola infecting chili in Thailand and Taiwan. All three novel species are new additions to the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili. More surveys in countries in Asia and Oceania are needed to identify the diversity and prevalence of species causing chili anthracnose. Understanding the taxonomy and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. has significant implications for fruit and vegetable industries, particularly regarding the serious biosecurity concerns associated with the introduction of exotic pathogens.",

The primary means to reduce the buildup of anthracnose fruit rot in the field is to harvest fruit frequently and remove all rotten fruit. Following severe infections early in the fruiting season, all infected fruit should be stripped from the plants and removed from the field. Infected areas of a field should be harvested last in the day, or workers should wash up and change to clean clothes when entering uninfected areas of the field after harvesting areas with fruit rot present.",

Field studies by Nam et al. (2006) showed that higher levels of nitrogen and potassium increased anthracnose crown rot disease severity compared to phosphorus and calcium. Anthracnose fruit rot was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl2 developed less fruit rot than those from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl2 (Smith and Gupton, 1993).",

Fruit on trees that had not been sprayed with fungicides were treated with calcium chloride, calcium propionate, or calcium silicate (1997 only) or calcium hydroxide (1998 only) at a concentration of 1,200 mg of calcium per liter. Each set of 10 fruits per treatment was sprayed to runoff with 1,200 mg of calcium per liter plus 0.1% Nufilm 17 (Miller Chemical Co., Biglerville, PA) weekly for three consecutive weeks. Preliminary tests with Nufilm 17 confirmed that the adjuvant had no effect on fruit infection by Colletotrichum spp. The day following the third calcium application, attached fruit were inoculated with either C. gloeosporioides or C. acutatum. Inoculations were made by preparing suspensions of conidia as described above, immersing 2.5-cm-wide cheesecloth strips (four layers thick) into the suspensions, and wrapping the strips around the widest part of the fruit. The strips were secured with one layer each of plastic wrap and aluminum foil. The inoculum was removed after 5 to 7 days. Control treatments included fruits sprayed with distilled water and inoculated, as well as non-sprayed fruits that were inoculated without conidia. The experiment was conducted three times in each of the two years. All fruit from the three trials in each year were harvested at the normal harvest date for the specific cultivar. The harvested fruits were arranged in labeled trays and were observed weekly for disease incidence, defined as the presence of bitter rot, determined from visible sporulation or reisolation when necessary. Data on disease incidence were subjected to analysis of variance, and means were separated using the Waller-Duncan k-ratio t test (SAS).",

The calcium propionate treatment showed 0% incidence at one week but rose to 77% by the fourth week. Calcium chloride had similar patterns, with lower initial incidences but higher rates by week four. Calcium silicate showed a significant increase in incidence, reaching 100% by week four. The control group had the highest incidences across all weeks, indicating that untreated fruit were most susceptible to the pathogens.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

Strawberry culture in the New World, particularly in North and South America, is less well documented. North American natives appreciated the springtime appearance of F. virginiana Duchesne (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) fruit, although this species was likely not cultivated until Europeans began exploring and settling in North America. However, native inhabitants of Chile and Peru had selected and cultivated superior variants of F. chiloensis (L.)

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",
            "Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum can be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories (Cai et al. 2011). Several of these lineages have now been systematically classified as species complexes comprising closely related sibling species (Weir et al. 2012). Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). Additionally, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex. However, different species do not require the same level of control when encountered in the field (Prihastuti et al. 2009).",
            "Molecular tools are increasingly being utilized for day-to-day identification by biosecurity officers and plant pathology researchers, highlighting the need for a taxonomy that accurately reflects genetically resolved groups, along with simple and reliable protocols for identifying those taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable. Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti, and some others.",
            "Over the past decade, our understanding of fungi and their relationships with plant hosts has grown exponentially due to advances in bioinformatics and molecular phylogenetics. The identification of cryptic taxa is progressing rapidly, and groups of fungi, including important plant pathogens, are primarily classified using molecular data-based phylogenetic inference. For instance, the C. acutatum, C. boninense, and C. gloeosporioides species complexes now each contain over 20 species. Several Colletotrichum species capable of causing strawberry anthracnose in temperate regions have been reported; however, knowledge of the composition of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions remains limited.",
            "Accepted 20 August 2007. To overcome taxonomic problems associated with traditional identification methods, DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize and resolve the taxonomic complexity of some fungal genera, such as Fusarium (O\u2019Donnell et al., 1998), Pestalotiopsis (Jeewon et al., 2004), and Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005). Cannon et al. (2000) stated that data derived from nucleic acid analyses should provide the most reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, sequence analysis of the ITS regions proved useful in studying the phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum species (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005).",
            "The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex contains taxa with significant biological, morphological, and genetic diversity (Sutton, 1992; Hyde et al., 2009). Some of these taxa have been designated as separate species, such as C. fragariae (Johnston et al., 2008). The ITS region has a limited ability to discriminate clades within this group; hence, a more appropriate biomarker is required for barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding should have low heterogeneity within species, yet enough variation to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications. It is also important that the gene can be easily sequenced for all species and does not require specific primers for each group (Seifert, 2009; Gilmore et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009).",
            "A detailed study of the C. boninense complex has revealed that even recently recognized species of Colletotrichum may obscure extensive molecular variation and may contain multiple taxa with distinct evolutionary origins. The ongoing debate regarding whether these segregate taxa should be classified at the species or infraspecific level (Cannon et al. 2008) remains unresolved. However, recent trends favor recognizing them as independent species. This approach simplifies nomenclature but may limit practical value for applied mycologists and plant pathologists, as the names do not necessarily indicate host specificity or nutritional/biological strategies. Unfortunately, many of these species cannot currently be reliably identified using single diagnostic (barcoding) sequences, making this aspect of their systematics a high priority for future research. On a positive note, there is now significantly more information regarding the phylogenetic components of the C. boninense complex.",
            "The recent epitypification of C. gloeosporioides marked an important milestone for taxonomic studies of the complex (Cannon et al., 2008). Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci. Molecular phylogenetic analyses using multilocus datasets are now providing an objective approach to determining species boundaries.",
            "Furthermore, unlike many undescribed or poorly understood lineages in this complex, the species we studied are well characterized and recognized through multilocus phylogenetic and morphological studies. This is crucial when evaluating the utility of newly developed molecular tools for systematic purposes. All these species have been simultaneously used in previous phylogenetic studies, establishing an objective starting point for understanding their taxonomic relationships and enabling a more meaningful comparison between traditional gene-tree concatenation methods and recent species-tree reconstruction techniques.",

            "Rain splash is the primary means by which conidia of Colletotrichum spp. spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduces the amount of rain penetrating the plant canopy, thereby decreasing splash. Most fruit infections occur within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997).",
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum is particularly significant in Europe, where it is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.",
            "Discussion: The spread of anthracnose fruit rot was observed in strawberry plots over two years by determining disease gradients in relation to the distance from introduced point sources of Colletotrichum acutatum inoculum. Disease spread was strongly influenced by the canopy, as evidenced by the significant effect of canopy row side (relative to the inoculum source) and plant density treatment on the height and steepness of the disease gradients. The near side overall exhibited a higher disease incidence than the far row side, and there was generally a negative but nonlinear relationship between plant density and disease incidence.",

(26) suggested that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberry are distinct from U.S. C. acutatum isolates found in a variety of hosts. In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California.

            "Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato, along with C. salicis and C. miyabeana, is commonly found on strawberries in Oceania but has only been sporadically detected in Europe. Isolates of these species have not been identified on strawberries in the UK. The variability observed within the UK populations of C. acutatum sensu lato aligns, in part, with previous reports of C. acutatum on strawberries in specific geographic regions. For instance, in countries such as France, Israel, Bulgaria, and Spain, most strawberry anthracnose pathogen isolates clustered into the same species, C. nymphaeae, with minimal intra-specific diversity observed within each country. In contrast, Belgian isolates exhibited a different composition: 33% belonged to C. nymphaeae, 5% to C. fioriniae, 50% to C. godetiae, 3% to C. acutatum sensu stricto, and 6% to C. salicis. The C. acutatum sensu lato status in the UK may stem from a recent introduction in the late 1970s from a limited number of sources. The reasons behind the varying occurrences of different Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry production across geographic locations remain unclear; however, the sources of imported planting materials and local trade practices are heavily implicated.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum s.l. was first described as a strawberry pathogen in California in 1983 and has since spread worldwide, including the UK, through runners and propagating material. An extensive genetic characterization of C. acutatum s.l., representing the global diversity of the pathogen, led to its subdivision into genetic groups named A1 to A9. More recently, C. acutatum s.l. has been subdivided into over 30 species based on multilocus phylogeny.",
            "C. acutatum is known as a common pathogen of various crops, including citrus, globally (Damm et al. 2012a). In Europe, it has been detected on hosts such as strawberry (Garrido et al. 2008), strawberry tree (Polizzi et al. 2011), and olives (Moral et al. 2008), but not on citrus until now. Furthermore, C. novae-zelandiae was previously reported from grapefruit and chili in New Zealand (Damm et al. 2012b). This study marks the first report of C. acutatum associated with citrus in Europe and the first detection of C. novae-zelandiae outside of New Zealand. C. karstii, part of the C. boninense species complex, has a wide geographical distribution and has been reported on citrus in South Africa, New Zealand, and China (Damm et al. 2012b, Peng et al. 2012, Huang et al. 2013).",
            "For the first time, four European isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from strawberry, which have been rarely observed, were included in a study of genetic polymorphism and pathogenic variability. The RAPD patterns of all 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides showed a high level of polymorphism, as previously described. Because isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberry collected in Europe and the United States were closely related genetically, it is possible that the C. gloeosporioides isolates pathogenic on strawberry were also introduced into Europe from North America through plant trade, similar to what has been suggested for C. acutatum. The dissemination of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum through plant exchanges between Europe and the United States, along with genetic and pathogenic variation within both species, could be further investigated using Californian and European isolates of C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Colletotrichum godetiae also occurs on hosts such as Fragaria, Malus, and Prunus, mainly in Europe and the Near East, causing fruit, leaf, or stem (cane, twig) diseases. Most of the isolates of C. acutatum s. lat. from Rhododendron in Sweden and Latvia (Vinnere et al. 2002) belong to this species, based on ITS data. One of their strains (S1) is included in Guerber et al. (2003); its GAPDH sequence groups with C. godetiae, thus confirming this placement. Additionally, several strains from Latin America have been studied. These occupy a subclade that has comparatively high bootstrap support, but as the subclades cannot be separated using any single gene of the set we have used, we amalgamate them into one species.",
            "Research has characterized C. acutatum s.l. populations related to strawberries in specific geographic areas, including Israel, France, Bulgaria, Spain, Belgium, and other European countries, as well as in specific regions of the USA. Other studies have attempted to characterize C. acutatum s.l. related to strawberries using isolates collected worldwide, employing genomic fingerprinting techniques (such as RFLP and apPCR) and sequence analysis based on the ITS region. Results indicate at least one representative clonal population, suggesting a single source of origin, and indicate that the disease spreads through infected propagation material. However, ITS sequences alone or genomic fingerprinting are not adequate to discriminate among the newly assigned species designations.",
            "Some host plants appear to be particularly susceptible to infection by multiple Colletotrichum taxa. The occurrence of species on strawberry has been well researched due to the former status of C. acutatum as a regulated quarantine pathogen. We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.",
            "Moreover, no correlation between genetic polymorphism and the two groups of pathogenicity has been studied. The purpose of this work was (i) to investigate genetic polymorphism and pathogenicity of C. acutatum, the major pathogen isolated from strawberry in Europe, and (ii) to determine the genetic relatedness of this pathogen to representative isolates of C. acutatum obtained from strawberry and other hosts from various countries worldwide. Additionally, isolates of C. gloeosporioides, which are occasionally observed on strawberry in Europe, were included in this work.",
            "The primary pathogens include Colletotrichum fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides. Each of these species contributes to the severity and spread of anthracnose diseases, underscoring the need for ongoing research and management strategies."

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",

The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. The objective of this report is to highlight examples of anthracnose-related research that have enhanced understanding of these diseases and their management.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

Additionally, the crop growth and tissue contents of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium in the entire above-ground parts of the plant were investigated. Elevated concentrations of nitrogen and potassium in the fertilizer solution increased disease severity, in contrast to phosphorus and calcium. Treatments using either ammonium (NH\u2084) or nitrate (NO\u2083) nitrogen showed no significant difference. The dry weight of the strawberry plants increased significantly with elevated concentrations of nitrogen (R\u00b2 = 0.9078) and phosphorus (R\u00b2 = 0.8842), but was not influenced by higher levels of potassium (R\u00b2 = 0.8587) and calcium (R\u00b2 = 0.6526).",

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).",
            "The experimental fungicide pydiflumetofen was not effective against C. acutatum in our in vitro and field studies. However, this fungicide is very active against B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew in strawberries (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.",
            "Control of C. acutatum in Infected Strawberry Transplants in the Greenhouse: Mortality of transplants caused by C. acutatum was significantly reduced by all fungicides and heat treatment compared to the non-treated control. Prochloraz-Zn was the most effective treatment, achieving 85.6% control, though it did not differ significantly from heat treatment, which achieved 75.6% control. Other treatments, including prochloraz-Zn/folpet (50.6% control), propiconazole (33.8% control), and difenoconazole (28.8% control), were less effective than prochloraz-Zn and heat treatment. It's important to note that prochloraz fungicides, along with difenoconazole and propiconazole, caused slight phytotoxicity in the treated plants, evidenced by mild stunting and leaf scorching."

            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",

            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a significant threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, during which high temperatures, humidity, and heavy rainfall are prevalent.",
            "Anthracnose crown rot was observed to be less severe in commercial fields when strawberries were grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, Smith (1987, 1989) determined that strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate. Anthracnose fruit rot caused by Colletotrichum acutatum was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of calcium chloride developed less fruit rot than that from plants receiving soil applications of calcium chloride (Smith and Gupton, 1993).",
            "For instance, Botrytis fruit rot of strawberries, caused by Botrytis cinerea, primarily occurs at lower temperatures during winter and spring (Elad et al. 2007); however, Colletotrichum species typically require warmer temperatures and predominantly cause anthracnose in strawberries during the summer (Henz et al. 1992; Xie et al. 2010). The minimum, optimum, and maximum growth temperatures are important biological traits widely used to characterize microorganisms (Damm et al. 2012a,b; Prihastuti et al. 2009; Weir et al. 2012). In this study, no significant differences were observed in the minimum and optimum growth temperatures of the five Colletotrichum species, but their maximum growth temperatures varied (as detailed in Table 4).",
            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.",
            "Anthracnose crown rot is less severe in commercial fields when strawberries are grown in soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992). In greenhouse studies, strawberries grown in soils with high nitrogen levels, especially from ammonium sources, were more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate (Smith, 2009a, 2009b). Field studies by Nam et al. (2006) showed that higher levels of nitrogen and potassium increased anthracnose crown rot disease severity compared to phosphorus and calcium. Anthracnose fruit rot was less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl2 developed less fruit rot than those from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl2 (Smith and Gupton, 1993).",
            "Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers. However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency."

Specifically, with a 20% drainage rate, leaf length and width increased by 14.1% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the four-times timer-supplying method, and by 23.6% and 29.5% compared to the six-times timer-supplying method. A lower rhizosphere water content, caused by a reduced drainage rate, increases root water stress, thereby inhibiting nutrient absorption and reducing plant and leaf area [26]. Leaf area was lowest at 1173 mm\u00b2 in the treatment with four daily watering events and highest at 1586 mm\u00b2 in the 20% drainage rate treatment, though the difference was not statistically significant (data not shown).",

Crouch et al. (2009) revealed a high error rate and a frequency of misidentification (86%) based on ITS sequence similarity comparisons within the C. graminicola species complex. ITS sequence data in the public domain can create significant confusion for end users; sequences are often entered under incorrect specific names and may represent several cryptic species. Identical sequences have frequently been recorded under different names.",
            "Based on morphological characteristics and analysis of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) ribosomal DNA, Xie et al. (2010) showed that strawberry anthracnose infections in Zhejiang and Shanghai were caused by C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae. However, since this study only analyzed a single region and did not use multiple genes, the results may not be entirely accurate. Indeed, multigene phylogenetic analyses, combined with morphological characteristics, have been used to identify many important pathogens (Cai et al. 2009; Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012). The classification and delimitation of Colletotrichum species have been debated (Weir et al. 2012). Many Colletotrichum isolates have been successfully identified based on multigene phylogenies and morphological characteristics, indicating that this method is mature and can accurately identify pathogens (Damm et al. 2012). However, morphological characteristics and multigene phylogenies have not yet been used to identify the Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry anthracnose in China or to determine the distributions of these species.",
            "rDNA genes exist as multiple copies in the genome. Due to the lesser conservation of sequence, the non-transcribed and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA subunits are suitable for detecting recent evolutionary divergence within Colletotrichum. In our study, limited restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified rDNA were utilized to differentiate representative isolates of C. gloeosporioides from a diverse range of hosts, as well as from rDNA of C. acutatum sourced from strawberry. Species-specific primers have been designed based on the dissimilarities in the sequences of the ITS regions from various Colletotrichum species. We employed such primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. As shown in Figure 5A, a single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range but was absent in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae amplified a specific 450-bp fragment, allowing these two species to be distinguished from C. acutatum. This method also facilitated the differentiation between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus. These findings indicate that rDNA analysis serves as an effective taxonomic tool for species identification and diagnostic pathogen detection in plants, although it may not reveal subpopulations within a species.",
            "A polyphasic approach combining multilocus phylogenetic analysis with recognizable phenotypic characteristics is recommended for accurate species identification within the Colletotrichum genus. According to Weir et al., internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences alone are not reliable for distinguishing different species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex. Additional loci recommended for identifying Colletotrichum species include actin (ACT), calmodulin (CAL), chitin synthase-1 (CHS-1), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH), and \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2).",
            "Protein-coding genes and their introns often exhibit more variation than the internal transcribed spacer (ITS), and the need for secondary barcodes based on these genes has been discussed in relation to certain groups of fungi (Fitzpatrick et al. 2006; Aguileta et al. 2008; Weir & Johnston 2011). Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1\u03b1) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al. (2009) included only five species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, treating the Musae and Kahawae clades at the species level. With the final classification presented here, none of the genes analyzed provides an effective barcode on its own across the entire complex. Among the individual genes, TUB2, GS, and GAPDH are among the most effective at distinguishing species. However, C. clidemiae is polyphyletic in the TUB2 gene tree, and GS sequences are necessary to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum. With GS, C. aotearoa, C. kahawae subsp. ciggaro, and C. siamense are paraphyletic. GAPDH is the easiest of all the tested genes to amplify and sequence; however, when using this gene, GS sequences are needed to distinguish C. fructicola from C. alienum and C. aeschynomenes from C. siamense, while C. tropicale is paraphyletic. In the species descriptions, we provide notes on which genes are best for genetic identification. These summaries are presented in Table 4, which outlines the effectiveness of all species and genes. For species represented by a single or only a few isolates, the species boundaries may not be accurate; we recommend utilizing two protein-coding genes in addition to ITS for sequence-based identifications. A meta-analysis of DNA barcodes across the entire genus will be required to identify the combination of genes effective for distinguishing all Colletotrichum species.",
            "Previously, anthracnose pathogens were often identified as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides or C. acutatum, primarily due to the identification procedures that typically did not utilize multiple markers, often analyzing only the Internal Transcribed Spacer (ITS) region. Consequently, the data obtained may not accurately reflect the true causal pathogens. It is now acknowledged that C. gloeosporioides is not the most common anthracnose pathogen affecting tropical fruit crops, as previously believed. Various Colletotrichum species are known to cause anthracnose in tropical fruit crops, presenting significant limitations in the production and marketing of these commodities.",
            "Morphologically, the causal agent closely resembled species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex, as per the classification by Weir et al. (2012). For molecular confirmation of the species, genomic DNA was extracted from 10 isolates using the Plant Genomic DNA Extraction Miniprep System (Viogene, Taipei). The internal transcribed spacer (ITS) region, chitin synthase (CHS-1), actin (ACT), \u03b2-tubulin 2 (TUB2), and calmodulin (CAL) genes were amplified by PCR.",
            "In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.",
            "Species-specific primers have primarily been designed based on differences in the sequence of the internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions of representative Colletotrichum isolates from different species. These primers have subsequently been used to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides across a broad host range and to detect latent infections in plants."

The best separability of the species was observed using both GPDH and histone 3 genes, which were superior to ITS, ACT, CHS, and beta-tubulin. The most appropriate gene for barcoding Colletotrichum must be selected during the species delimitation process since we can only choose one or more barcoding genes when we know which taxa need to be distinguished. A good approach would be to test and establish a selection of loci used by different groups involved in Colletotrichum systematics to work towards identifying the best barcoding gene.",
            "Abstract: Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is one of the major problems in mango production worldwide, including Thailand. All mango cultivars are susceptible, but Nam Dok Mai See Thong (NDMST) is the most vulnerable. Through a single spore isolation method, a total of 37 isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from NDMST showing anthracnose symptoms. Identification was performed using a combination of morphological characteristics, Koch\u2019s postulates, and phylogenetic analysis. The pathogenicity assay and Koch\u2019s postulates on leaves and fruit confirmed that all Colletotrichum spp. tested were causal agents of mango anthracnose. Multilocus analysis using DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2), actin (ACT), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) was performed for molecular identification. Two concatenated phylogenetic trees were constructed using either two loci (ITS and TUB2) or four loci (ITS, TUB2, ACT, and CHS-1). Both phylogenetic trees were indistinguishable and showed that these 37 isolates belong to C. acutatum, C. asianum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. siamense. Our results indicated that using at least two loci of ITS and TUB2 was sufficient to infer Colletotrichum species complexes. Of the 37 isolates, C. gloeosporioides was the most dominant species (19 isolates), followed by C. asianum (10 isolates), C. acutatum (5 isolates), and C. siamense (3 isolates). In Thailand, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been reported to cause anthracnose in mango; however, this is the first report of C. asianum and C. siamense associated with mango anthracnose in central Thailand.",

            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",
            "Molecular approaches have been successfully utilized for the taxonomic identification and determination of genetic diversity in Colletotrichum populations. Recent studies have employed species-specific primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides from various hosts. To enhance the effectiveness of this approach for in vivo pathogen diagnosis, it is essential to develop simple and rapid DNA extraction techniques, enabling multiple sampling and testing.",
            "This study has enhanced our understanding of the diversity of Colletotrichum species associated with mango anthracnose in China. Further research is required to determine the differences in biological and infection characteristics among various Colletotrichum species affecting mango, as well as the molecular mechanisms responsible for these differences and their effects on mango anthracnose disease in the field. There have been few studies on the etiology and epidemiology of Colletotrichum species on mango. Therefore, future work on pathogenic mechanisms could be helpful for the prevention and control of mango anthracnose disease.",
            "The Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex contains taxa with significant biological, morphological, and genetic diversity (Sutton, 1992; Hyde et al., 2009). Some of these taxa have been designated as separate species, such as C. fragariae (Johnston et al., 2008). The ITS region has a limited ability to discriminate clades within this group; hence, a more appropriate biomarker is required for barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding should have low heterogeneity within species, yet enough variation to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications. It is also important that the gene can be easily sequenced for all species and does not require specific primers for each group (Seifert, 2009; Gilmore et al., 2009; Chen et al., 2009).",
            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",

            "From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.",
            "Mango anthracnose affects not only the fruit but also the leaves, twigs, and flowers. Leaf symptoms include black necrotic spots with irregular shapes on both sides of the leaves, which can also appear on twigs and flowers. These spots may merge to form larger infected areas. Infected tissues eventually dry out, leading to the death of the affected plant parts.",
            "Supplementary Figure S1 provides a visual representation of anthracnose symptoms on strawberry plants, depicting various stages and characteristics of infection. Panel (a) shows a strawberry plant affected by anthracnose crown rot, exhibiting chlorotic to blighted leaves and wilting. Panel (b) presents a longitudinal section of an infected crown, revealing marbled reddish-brown necrosis. Panel (c) illustrates black necrotic leaf spots, while panel (d) highlights withering and girdling on a runner. Panel (e) displays the fungal colony's initial white coloration, which later becomes light gray on the upper side. Finally, panel (f) shows conidia that are hyaline, oblong to cylindrical, with rounded obtuse ends, with a scale bar indicating a size of 10 \u03bcm.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum is particularly significant in Europe, where it is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.",
            "Figure 1 illustrates the anthracnose disease cycle in tropical fruit crops, drawn by Latiffah Zakaria. Anthracnose pathogens infect not only fruits but also other plant organs, including leaves, flowers, twigs, and branches. The conidia and spores formed in these infected tissues are released and dispersed during rainy days or periods of high humidity, becoming the primary inoculum for fruit infection at the preharvest stage. The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions that contain conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions can merge to form larger lesions. These dark lesions on the fruit surface are unattractive to consumers and significantly reduce the market value of the affected fruits. Figures 2A\u2013E display anthracnose lesions on several tropical fruit crops.",
            "Chilli pepper fruits with blemishes have reduced marketability (Manandhar et al., 1995). Colletotrichum spp. are among the most significant plant pathogens globally, causing the economically important disease anthracnose in a wide range of hosts, including cereals, legumes, vegetables, and tree fruits (Bailey & Jeger, 1992). Among these hosts, Capsicum annuum is considered the most important vegetable in Thailand (Poulos, 2002) and is severely infected by anthracnose, with yield losses of up to 50% (Pakdeevaraporn et al., 2005). Typical anthracnose symptoms on chilli fruits include sunken necrotic tissues with concentric rings of acervuli. Accurate taxonomic identification is crucial for plant breeding and disease management (Freeman et al., 1998). Traditionally, identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species were based on morphological characteristics such as the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence of setae or a teleomorph, and cultural characteristics like colony morphology.",
            "The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers. However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",
            "Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.",
            "During the survey of strawberry fields, symptoms of anthracnose disease were primarily observed as anthracnose fruit rot (AFR), alongside flower blight, sunken fusiform lesions on runners, V-shaped necrotic lesions around the principal vein, and stunted, semi-dried plants [Figure 1 (A-D)]. These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017). In pathogenicity tests, all C. nymphaeae isolates were able to..."

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",
            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",
            "Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].",
            "The study concluded that captafol was the most effective fungicide against C. fragariae, providing adequate control at concentrations of 1.2-2.4 g a.i./L when applied every 7 days. The mixture of captan and benomyl offered some control but was less effective than captafol. The findings suggest that maintaining the application of fungicides at appropriate intervals is crucial for managing strawberry anthracnose effectively.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses from both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also diminished economic losses due to these diseases. Nevertheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental factors are highly favorable for anthracnose development.",

Changes in cultural practices have led to reduced levels of disease. Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly decreased losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. The introduction of partially resistant cultivars has also helped mitigate economic losses due to these diseases. Nonetheless, growers may still experience severe losses when environmental conditions are highly conducive to anthracnose development.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose.

            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.",
            "The efficacy of fungicides for anthracnose control is routinely assessed in field studies. For example, 16 different fungicide treatments were evaluated in five studies conducted in Hammond, LA, and Poplarville, MS, during the 2002, 2003, and 2005 fruiting seasons (Wedge et al., 2007)."

The utility of physiological characteristics in differentiating closely related Colletotrichum species has been established in some cases, but such assessments have not been conducted for most species within this genus. The authors suggest that carbohydrate utilization and relative growth rates should be considered as polyphasic characters for studying Colletotrichum, especially for morphologically similar species that display phylogenetic distinctions.",
            "Morphological and Cultural Characterization: All tested isolates developed white colonies that turned gray to black after 14 days on PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar). Colony sectoring was observed in 8 of the 29 isolates. There was considerable variation in the mycelial growth rate among the 29 isolates of Colletotrichum. The average mycelial growth rate for C. asianum was 6.7 to 10.7 mm/day, for C. fructicola, 7.3 to 12.4 mm/day, and for C. siamense, 9.4 to 11.1 mm/day. The conidia were all hyaline, guttulate, one-celled, and cylindrical.",
            "In addition to phylogenetic analysis, we investigated morphological features, including cultural characteristics, colony growth rate, and the shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as detached fruit assays (see Table 3). The cultural characteristics of C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates were consistent with findings from previous studies (Prihastuti et al. 2009; Yang et al. 2009). Colonies of C. siamense appeared either white with gray or white with some orange, while C. fructicola colonies featured dark gray centers and white peripheral mycelium. Additionally, the size variation of conidia between our C. siamense and C. fructicola isolates aligned with the known variability within the C. gloeosporioides species complex (Weir et al. 2012). Specifically, the mean length of C. siamense conidia was slightly shorter than that of C. fructicola, although the mean width of conidia from both species was nearly identical (Weir et al. 2012). Furthermore, the colony growth rate and appressorial size of C. fructicola were higher and larger, respectively, compared to those of C. siamense when cultured on PDA at 28\u00b0C in the dark, consistent with previous data (Prihastuti et al. 2009). However, differences in conidial and appressorial sizes were noted across studies. For instance, the mean length of conidia from our C. siamense isolates was 16.0 \u00b5m, while Prihastuti et al. (2009) reported a mean length of 10.17 \u00b5m, which may be due to variations in cultural conditions or differences in host sources. Yang et al. (2009) used the same C. siamense isolates as those in the Prihastuti et al. study and recorded a conidial length of 15.3 \u00b5m.",
            "Notes: Isolates of Colletotrichum siamense from different countries showed variations in morphological characteristics, including growth rates and culture morphology on PDA. Representative conidial measurements from isolates representing various subclades in the phylogenetic trees are as follows: CPC 30233 (Gowa, Indonesia), 12.5 \u00d7 17 \u00d7 2.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00b5m; UOM 1132 (Ratchaburi, Thailand), 9.5 \u00d7 14.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 5 \u00b5m; UOM 1126/F4-1C (Kanchanaburi, Thailand), 12 \u00d7 15 \u00d7 5 \u00d7 7 \u00b5m; UOM 1116 (Kandy, Sri Lanka), 10.5 \u00d7 16.5 \u00d7 3.5 \u00d7 5.5 \u00b5m. These morphological characteristics were highly consistent within each country. The species was described by Prihastuti et al. (2009); conidia from the ex-holotype specimen (ICMP 18578/BDP-I2) were reported as 7 \u00d7 18.3 \u00d7 3 \u00d7 4.3 \u00b5m (mean = 10.18 \u00b1 1.74 \u00d7 3.46 \u00b1 0.36), encompassing the range observed in our isolates. This species is known to be biologically and geographically diverse and can be found on various hosts across several tropical and subtropical regions (Weir et al. 2012).",
            "A representative isolate from each of five Colletotrichum species was grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) at temperatures ranging from 18\u00b0C to 32\u00b0C. The maximum growth rate of C. siamense ML133 was estimated at 27.9\u00b0C, while the maximum growth rates for C. fructicola ML348, C. karstii ML351, C. boninense ML521, and C. miaoliense ML1040 were observed at 26.0\u00b0C, 26.9\u00b0C, 24.0\u00b0C, and 26.5\u00b0C, respectively (see Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S3). The growth rate of C. boninense ML521 drastically decreased at 32\u00b0C. C. miaoliense ML1040 exhibited the slowest growth rate across all tested temperatures, except at 32\u00b0C. The ranking of species by growth rates at higher temperatures (28\u00b0C, 30\u00b0C, and 32\u00b0C) is as follows: C. siamense ML133 > C. fructicola ML348 > C. karstii ML351 and C. boninense ML521 (at 28\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C) > C. miaoliense ML1040 > C. boninense ML521 (at 32\u00b0C) (refer to Figure 5 and Supplementary Table S3). Additionally, the growth rates of C. siamense ML133 were compared with those of two other representative isolates from C. siamense, C. fructicola, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense (see Supplementary Table S4). The ranking of isolates by mycelial growth rates at both 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C on PDA was as follows: C. siamense ML133 and ML540 > C. siamense ML612 and C. fructicola ML368 > C. fructicola ML356 and C. karstii ML1792 > C. karstii ML442 > C. miaoliense ML1042 and ML1794.",
            "The conidia of C. fructicola were observed after seven days of incubation on PDA media. The colony diameters were measured daily for seven days, allowing for the calculation of the average mean daily growth rate (in mm per day). The colors of the conidial masses and zonation were recorded at the end of the incubation period. Appressoria were produced using a slide culture technique, where a conidial suspension was placed in a hole on a glass slide and covered with a cover slip. The slide was then placed in an empty Petri dish containing wet filter paper and incubated at 28\u00b0C for two to four days.",
            "Based on published data, we discussed the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in China. C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex are currently the most prevalent. The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift in the prevailing Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in various regions may be linked to global warming, changes in cultivation patterns\u2014from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation\u2014and the substitution of strawberry varieties.",
            "This is the first time C. siamense and C. fructicola have been isolated from peach. Both species were originally isolated from coffee berries in northern Thailand (Prihastuti et al. 2009). According to Weir et al. (2012), these two species exhibit biological and geographical diversity. Besides infecting Coffea, C. siamense has been found on various hosts including Persea americana, Pistacia vera, Hymenocallis americana, Dioscorea rotundata, Carica papaya, Capsicum annuum, Vitis vinifera, Fragaria ananassa, Malus domestica, and Jasminum sambac. In contrast, C. fructicola has been isolated from Pyrus pyrifolia, Limonium, Malus domestica, Fragaria ananassa, Persea americana, Ficus, Dioscorea, Theobroma, and Tetragastris (Weir et al. 2012). Both C. siamense and C. fructicola have been isolated from strawberries, with C. siamense also isolated from other hosts."

            "Effect of Temperature on Mycelial Growth: The optimum temperature for all five Colletotrichum species in this study was 28 \u00b0C; however, their tolerance to high temperatures (34 \u00b0C) varied (Fig. 7). The five species were classified into four groups based on their maximum growth temperatures (Table 4). Isolates of C. nymphaeae, isolated only in Enshi, were sensitive to high temperatures, showing an average growth rate of 0.11 mm/day at 34 \u00b0C, with no mycelial growth observed above this temperature (Table 4). C. fructicola and C. aenigma showed similar high-temperature tolerances, growing very slowly at 36 \u00b0C, with colony diameters smaller than those of C. murrayae and C. gloeosporioides but larger than those of C. nymphaeae. No mycelial growth of C. fructicola and C. aenigma was observed above 36 \u00b0C (Fig. 7). In contrast, C. gloeosporioides and C. murrayae were tolerant of high temperatures, exhibiting significantly larger colony diameters than the other species at temperatures above 36 \u00b0C. Mycelial growth was observed even at 40 \u00b0C, with average growth rates of 0.11 and 0.08 mm/day, respectively (Fig. 7).",
            "According to current data, the results revealed that each species possesses a stable and distinguishable maximum growth temperature, which can be used to differentiate Colletotrichum species, particularly those that are morphologically similar. The frequencies and distributions of these five species relate to differences in high-temperature tolerance and pathogenicity. This research may enhance our understanding of how Colletotrichum species emerge and spread to geographical regions with varying latitudes or elevations.",
            "The characteristics of conidia, including color, size, and shape, as well as optimal temperature, growth rate, presence or absence of setae, and existence of the teleomorph Glomerella, play crucial roles in differentiating species of the Colletotrichum genus. This discussion focuses on three anthracnose pathosystems affecting the fruits of almond, avocado, and strawberry, which exhibit different disease patterns.",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides var. minor is, as expected, very similar to G. cingulata. C. dematium is a moderately fast-growing species with a relatively high optimum and maximum growth temperature. Over the years, species of Colletotrichum have been isolated on many occasions from fruit and vegetative parts of economic plants in Queensland. The pathogenicity of the various species to their usual hosts is well established. In cases where a species has been recovered from a particular host only occasionally and no pathogenicity tests have been carried out, the nature of the lesion and the circumstances of the isolation have been taken as evidence for or against its presence in a pathogenic capacity.",
            "The table presents temperature data for five species of Colletotrichum, detailing the number of isolates tested and their optimum growth temperatures. For instance, Glomerella cingulata had three isolates with an optimum growth range between 26.5\u00b0C and 28.5\u00b0C, while C. gloeosporioides var. minor had five isolates with a similar optimum range of 26.0\u00b0C to 28.5\u00b0C.

The Colletotrichum isolates examined showed significant diversity, which may correlate with varying environmental conditions such as temperature and rainfall, as well as the sample collection time and source. The major species identified associated with mango anthracnose in China were Colletotrichum asianum, C. fructicola, and C. siamense. This finding aligns with the report by Vieira et al. (2014), which indicated that C. asianum was the most common endophytic species found in mango trees.",

Briefly, an exponential concentration gradient for each fungicide was achieved by depositing appropriate stock concentrations radially onto 15-cm PDA plates using a spiral plater (Autoplate 4000; Spiral Biotech, Inc., Norwood, MA). For azoxystrobin, PDA was amended with salicylhydroxamic acid at 100 mg/ml. Stock concentrations were 1,000 mg/ml for natamycin, 100 or 5,000 mg/ml for azoxystrobin, 200 mg/ml for chlorothalonil, 50 mg/ml for cyprodinil, 20 mg/ml for fludioxonil, and 10,000 mg/ml for pydiflumetofen. Sterile water was applied to control plates. After 2 to 4 hours, 10 ml of each conidial suspension (5 \u00d7 10^5 spores/ml) was streaked radially from the outer edge toward the center of the plate using a sterile pestle. Each isolate was replicated on opposite sides of the plate, and four isolates were evaluated on each plate. Plates were incubated in the dark for 20 hours at 20\u00b0C for evaluation of conidial germination (azoxystrobin only) or for 72 hours at 25\u00b0C for evaluation of mycelial growth.

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].",

            "Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum species is one of the most destructive diseases affecting strawberry production worldwide. Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",
            "Ji et al. (2022) reported that a total of 11 Colletotrichum species have been identified as pathogens of strawberries in China, which will be comprehensively introduced later. In Europe, strawberry anthracnose is largely attributed to the C. acutatum complex. Strains of C. godetiae infectious to strawberries have been documented in Ireland and Norway (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Chethana et al. 2016). In Denmark, C. nymphaeae is the only Colletotrichum species reported as a strawberry pathogen (Braganca et al. 2016), with similar reports from Bulgaria (Bobev et al. 2002; Jelev et al. 2008; Jayawardena et al. 2016b), Switzerland, and Portugal (Baroncelli et al. 2015). Both C. godetiae and C. nymphaeae were identified as strawberry pathogens in the Netherlands (Baroncelli et al. 2015; Jayawardena et al. 2016b) and Spain (Damm et al. 2012; Baroncelli et al. 2015).",
            "The first formal report of strawberry anthracnose in China was made by Hu (1990) at the fifth annual conference of the Chinese Society of Plant Pathology, which took place in Jiangsu Province. In Shanghai, C. fragariae and C. acutatum were identified as strawberry pathogens (Shao 1992; Ye et al. 1997). Subsequently, fruit rot caused by C. acutatum was reported in Shanghai based on morphological identification (Dai et al. 2006). Molecular analysis using ITS sequences facilitated the identification of 16 C. gloeosporioides isolates and one C. acutatum isolate collected from 1996 to 2006 in Shanghai (Ren et al. 2008). Based on ITS sequences and restriction enzyme digestion, 31 Colletotrichum isolates collected from diseased strawberries between 2006 and 2007 in Shanghai and Zhejiang were identified as C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae (Xie et al. 2010). Following this, C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae were again reported as pathogens affecting strawberries in Zhejiang (Ren et al. 2011). A study collected 114 fungal isolates from the C. gloeosporioides complex from diseased strawberries during 2010 to 2013 in Zhejiang Province, though they were not distinguished at the species level (Lin et al. 2016).",
            "In a study conducted in Zhejiang province, China, the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates was assessed on wounded and non-wounded strawberry leaves. Most isolates, such as ZJE-3, exhibited strong pathogenicity on wounded leaves but weak pathogenicity on non-wounded leaves (Supplementary Fig. S3). A phylogenetic analysis was performed using five genes (GAPDH, CAL, CHS-1, ACT, and ITS) to identify 91 different isolates from strawberry anthracnose samples. The species identified were C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. aenigma, and C. siamense, all belonging to the C. gloeosporioides species complex. This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang, where it was found to be the second most common species. Although originally described from coffee plantations in Thailand, C. siamense has a wide geographical distribution and diverse host range. The study noted variability in its morphological characteristics, suggesting environmental conditions may influence mycelial growth. Different colony types were observed, with a generally grayish-white appearance and slow hyphal growth under the tested culture conditions. The pathogenicity varied among C. siamense isolates, indicating a need for further research on their pathogenesis.",
            "All identified Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose belonged to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. Among these, we identified 48 isolates of C. fructicola, 21 isolates of C. siamense, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides, and 9 isolates of C. aenigma. Notably, C. siamense was distributed in the central and eastern regions of Zhejiang Province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Taizhou). This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang Province. C. fructicola was identified as the most dominant species responsible for strawberry anthracnose in the region.",
            "C. siamense and C. fructicola are recognized as the primary pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose crown rot in the Asia-Pacific region (Nam et al. 2013; Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Gan et al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022). These two species are the most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species worldwide (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Both are cosmopolitan fungi that can adapt to a diverse array of host plants, with higher occurrences reported in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia compared to other continents.",

            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).",
            "The purpose of this research was to evaluate new fungicides with registration potential for use as preplant dip treatments of bare-root strawberry transplants for the management of anthracnose crown rot. The specific objectives were to (i) determine whether QoI...",
            "Anthracnose crown rot of strawberry, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, is an important disease affecting California nursery and fruit production. Preplant dip treatments of transplants with fludioxonil-cyprodinil or azoxystrobin are industry standards for managing the disease and have been used extensively. Following reports of reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin in the field, high levels of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resistance were detected in California isolates of the pathogen. Resistance was associated with the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene, similar to a previous report from Florida, and there were no detected fitness penalties in pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, several alternative fungicides were investigated in laboratory and field studies. Subsequently, the new biofungicide natamycin was identified. Baseline sensitivities of 74 isolates of C. acutatum to natamycin were determined to be unimodal, with a range from 0.526 to 1.996 mg/ml (mean 0.973 mg/ml).",
            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",

Effect of fungicide dip treatments of A and B (Portola); C and D (Monterey); or E and F (Fronteras) strawberry transplants inoculated with a mixture of four isolates\u2014each of A, C, and E (quinone outside inhibitor [QoI]-sensitive) or B, D, and F (QoI-resistant) isolates of Colletotrichum acutatum on disease severity. Plants were evaluated after 5 or 14 weeks for aboveground vegetative growth based on a rating scale of 0 = healthy, vigorous plant; 1 = growth reduced; 2 = growth and vigor reduced; 3 = growth and vigor extremely reduced; and 4 = dead. Average disease severity was determined based on 10 plants for each of four replications in each experiment. Bars followed by the same letter within a graph are not significantly different based on least significant difference mean separation (P > 0.05) procedures. Rates are based on active ingredient, except for Streptomyces lydicus, where the rate is based on the formulated product.",
            "Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.",
            "The experimental fungicide pydiflumetofen was not effective against C. acutatum in our in vitro and field studies. However, this fungicide is very active against B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew in strawberries (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.",
            "C. acutatum inoculum on transplant foliage may contribute to the effectiveness of fungicide dips used in Israel to control strawberry anthracnose (14). Although most evidence for the role of symptomless foliage as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose originates from controlled environment studies (12, 19), symptomless leaves provided sufficient inoculum to initiate fruit rot development in preliminary field trials (41). These preliminary results corroborate the relevance of our findings to the behavior of C. acutatum under field conditions.",
            "Control of Colletotrichum acutatum is highly dependent on frequent applications of both multi-site and single-site fungicides (Mertely et al. 2017a, b). Multi-site fungicides, such as captan, provide satisfactory control of C. acutatum, but they lack a curative effect, necessitating weekly applications throughout the season (Mertely et al. 2017b). Single-site fungicides, particularly the quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), exhibit a post-infection effect on anthracnose; however, growers are limited in the number of applications permitted during the strawberry production season (Mertely et al. 2017b; Turechek et al. 2006). Given the limited QoI applications allowed during the fruit production phase, the use of broad-spectrum multi-site fungicides is recommended during the vegetative phase. Nevertheless, to ensure symptom-free transplants, single-site fungicides have frequently been used in nurseries, resulting in the selection of fungicide-resistant populations of Botrytis cinerea, another significant strawberry pathogen (Oliveira et al. 2017).",
            "Treatments were evaluated as dips for transplants because planting material is a primary source of introducing Colletotrichum acutatum into a field. Currently, dip treatments for transplants are a common practice in California for establishing new strawberry fields. Our results showed that plant mortality was significantly reduced by natamycin and fludioxonil-cyprodinil when transplants were inoculated with both QoI-sensitive and -resistant isolates. Under highly favorable disease conditions, additional foliar treatments will need to be applied to protect plants from petiole and leaf lesions, as well as fruit rot throughout the season. These treatments can be integrated with those for managing gray mold caused by Botrytis spp."

            "As no essential element can substitute for another, it is critically important to identify where and when such deficiencies occur. This is where the role of soil and plant analysis comes in. Techniques have been developed to evaluate soil fertility constraints based on soil chemical extraction and the analysis of the plants that grow in such soils. Both methods are complementary and, when calibrated with field crop responses to fertilizers, provide a rational basis for identifying which elements are lacking and how much fertilizer\u2014whether organic or inorganic\u2014should be applied. Therefore, soil and plant analysis laboratories play a vital role in the agricultural development of the WANA region. However, the process does not end there. To be meaningful and valid, tests must be appropriate for their intended purpose, as well as reliable and repeatable.",

Nutritionally, plant analysis is based on the principle that the concentration of a nutrient within the plant reflects the interaction of all factors that have influenced it. The principles and procedures used for plant analyses have evolved over many years and adapted as knowledge about essential elements for plant life cycles has increased. Consequently, plant analyses have become integral to most agronomic research and serve as a valuable tool for crop consultants and fertilizer dealers in monitoring production fields.",

The optimum temperature for infection was found to be between 25 and 30\u00b0C. Relationships between epidemiological processes (i.e., infection and sporulation) and temperature and/or wetness duration for Colletotrichum species have also been studied with other hosts. For instance, Denham and Waller (6) observed an increase in disease incidence in citrus caused by C. gloeosporioides, correlating with an increase in wetness duration after rain events during flowering periods. They utilized field studies on disease incidence, alongside assessments of flower development, blossom patterns, and climatic data, in their observations. Fitzell et al.

Specifically, we aimed to assess whether phosphorous acid or its salt, phosphite, could substitute for phosphate fertilization and support healthy plant development in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum) and green pepper (Capsicum annuum).",
            "Evaluating the effect of combined phosphate and phosphite nutrition, Carswell et al. (3) found that adding phosphite (1.5 to 10 mM) to phosphate-limited Brassica nigra seedlings reduced plant growth. In phosphate-sufficient plants, only the 10 mM phosphite levels caused a reduction. Additionally, while the root-to-shoot ratios of phosphate-stressed plants were typically high (3, 11, 13), phosphite supplementation decreased the root-to-shoot ratio to about 40% of control values. Carswell et al. (3) explained these effects as a disruption of the phosphate-starvation response by phosphonates, causing phosphate-limited plants to behave as though they are phosphorus-sufficient. In our study, root-to-shoot ratios of tomato plants were also significantly lower for phosphorous acid-fertilized plants compared to no-phosphorus plants, indicating similar effects on phosphate metabolism. However, a combined treatment of 1 mM phosphate and 0.3 mM phosphorous acid increased leaf area significantly in two experiments, with a trend for greater leaf dry weight compared to phosphate treatment alone in three experiments. This finding might explain the labeling of commercial phosphite formulations as supplemental fertilizers for improved plant growth and increased crop yield. Additional studies are needed to evaluate possible interactions between phosphite and phosphate fertilizers. Phosphorous acid is readily absorbed by plants and is both xylem- and phloem-mobile (10). Using ion chromatography for quantifying phosphorous acid, Ouimette and Coffey (10) demonstrated that phosphonates are quite stable in avocado plants, persisting in this form for at least several months. Similarly, Robertson and Boyer (12) reported a biological inertness of organic and inorganic phosphites. In our experiments, phosphate concentrations in tomato plants treated with technical phosphite did not differ statistically from those of the no-phosphorus control plants. Phosphate levels in the solutions were not significantly different (P > 0.05) when freshly made or after one week in the recirculating hydroponic system, supporting previous work that molecular oxygen does not readily oxidize phosphonates in aqueous solutions (12). A general trend for higher phosphate levels was observed in the 1.0 mM phosphite solutions compared to the no-phosphorus treatment. In both fresh and aged solutions, measurable phosphate levels in the no-phosphorus and 1 mM phosphite treatments ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Contamination may have occurred from the salts used in the basic nutrient solution. In plants treated with a commercial formulation of phosphite, phosphate concentrations were significantly above those of the no-phosphorus treated plants. This increase could be explained by the slightly elevated phosphate levels in the nutrient solution. Decreased phosphate concentrations in the plant tissue of the 1 mM phosphate/0.3 mM phosphite treated plants compared to the 1 mM phosphate treated plants aligns with previous studies that showed growth of phosphate-sufficient plants in the presence of phosphite resulted in reduced root and leaf phosphate levels (3). The effect of phosphorus compounds on disease control was studied using P. capsici\u2013inoculated pepper plants. Plants grown with both formulations of phosphorous...",

        "retrieved_context": [
            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",
            "Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.",
            "Anthracnose disease, caused by C. acutatum, has become one of the major fungal pathogens of strawberry worldwide. In Israel, the fungus was first reported in 1995 and has since spread to most strawberry cultivation areas within the country. Mother plants are commonly infected in the nursery; however, symptoms may develop later during daughter plant establishment, after planting. Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel. The main objectives of this study were to assess the potential for cross-inoculation, survival, and pathogenicity of C. acutatum on strawberry and other plants that may serve as a primary inoculum source under greenhouse conditions.",
            "Since the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields is infected transplants, planting disease-free plants is the best control method. However, obtaining anthracnose-free plants has become more challenging as the geographic range of the causal pathogens has expanded to most areas where strawberry plants are produced. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern U.S., where the pathogens are endemic, by locating plant production nurseries away from commercial fruit production fields.",
            "As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.",
            "While C. acutatum infections are frequently observed in strawberry production fields, it has been suggested that quiescently infected transplants from nurseries serve as the primary inoculum source for field infections (Howard et al. 1992; Peres et al. 2005). In Florida, strawberries are treated as annual crops and are cultivated throughout the winter. However, during the hot summer months, extreme temperatures negatively impact the survival of C. acutatum in soil and plant debris (Ure\u00f1a-Padilla et al. 2001).",
            "Because the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appeared to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised, after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s, to obtain their transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, which were believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. More recently, C. acutatum has been found in some nurseries in these areas. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants can be produced in the southeastern United States by locating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants remain the primary control method for anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.",
            "Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues."

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",

In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000).

However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",

            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",
            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",
            "Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002). There appears to be little to no evidence of co-evolution between host and pathogen, particularly in cultivated fruit systems like strawberry and olive, which are susceptible to many members of this species complex (Jayawardena et al., 2016).",
            "The study also detailed the global distribution of Colletotrichum species occurring in Citrus hosts and allied genera in a comprehensive table. The table outlined various species complexes and specific species, alongside their respective hosts and geographical distributions. For instance, C. acutatum was associated with Citrus sinensis flowers and leaves, while C. gloeosporioides appeared in diverse hosts such as Citrus limon and Murraya paniculata, with distributions noted in regions including Brazil, China, Italy, Malta, and the USA.",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).",

It highlights the prevalence of anthracnose fruit rot in Iran and assesses the susceptibility of 52 commercial cultivars against the pathogen. The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "The USDA-ARS program resulted in over 1,500 anthracnose-resistant selections from seedlings field-tested in Mississippi. Four of these selections were released as breeding lines (Galletta et al., 1993), and one was released as the cultivar Pelican, which is highly resistant to anthracnose crown rot caused by Colletotrichum fragariae and to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum (Smith et al., 1998). Pelican is also resistant to five races of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae. Other selections have been utilized as parent lines in various breeding programs. To enhance genetic diversity in strawberry germplasm used in breeding, anthracnose-resistant clones have been identified in native plant collections and are being incorporated as parent lines (Lewers et al., 2007).",
            "In this study, distinct levels of resistance to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) were revealed in trials involving detached leaves, fruit, and crown-based assays. In all assays, fruit, leaf, and crown infections were confirmed by re-isolation of the pathogen. In the detached leaf assay, the cultivars \u2018Missionary\u2019, \u2018New Kurdistan\u2019, \u2018Ventana1\u2019, \u2018Ventana\u2019, and \u2018Blakemore\u2019 exhibited significantly greater resistance to the disease compared to other cultivars (df = 24, F = 14.66, P \u2264 0.01).

            "Planting resistant cultivars such as Sweet Charlie, Florida Radiance, and Florida Elyana has reduced losses from anthracnose fruit rot in Florida, likely because C. acutatum lacks the genetic diversity to overcome this resistance (Mertely et al., 2009). However, when moderately susceptible (e.g., Strawberry Festival) or highly susceptible cultivars (e.g., Camarosa and Treasure) are grown, regular fungicide applications are often necessary to manage the disease (Chang and Smith, 2007). Unless highly resistant cultivars are planted, growers must rely on a combination of chemical applications and cultural practices to mitigate anthracnose losses.",
            "In a related study, the severity of anthracnose fruit rot, caused by Colletotrichum acutatum, was also reduced with the application of Ca(NO3)2 on greenhouse-grown strawberries. Similar findings were reported regarding the control of Fusarium diseases in tomatoes and chrysanthemums. Notably, there was a significant variation in foliar N levels among different strawberry clones, suggesting that N applications should be customized for each cultivar. Nonetheless, the trend of decreased anthracnose severity with nitrate fertilizers was consistent across five strawberry clones tested, indicating that other cultivars may respond similarly.",

The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",

            "These findings align with previous studies indicating that susceptibility to anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) varies among different organs of a cultivar, including fruit, leaf, and root. Notably, no relationship was established between the susceptibility of various cultivars and the different organs of a single cultivar (Delp and Milholland, 1980; Smith and Spires, 1982; Smith and Black, 1990; Chandler et al., 1997). Furthermore, the presence of the pathogen might not cause symptoms on foliage, leading to latent infections. Consistent with Shuman (2001), our results suggest that the detached fruit assay is a better indicator of AFR disease susceptibility, though other methods could also enhance the understanding of disease epidemiology."

A collection of 148 Colletotrichum spp. isolates, including 67 C. acutatum s.l. isolates associated with the phytosanitary history of UK strawberry production, was used to characterize multilocus genetic variation of this pathogen in the UK, relative to additional reference isolates representing a worldwide sampling of the fungus diversity. Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively. Among these species, 12 distinct haplotypes were identified, suggesting multiple introductions into the country. A subset of isolates was also used to assess aggressiveness in causing disease on strawberry plants and fruits. Isolates belonging to C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, representative of the UK anthracnose pathogen populations, showed variation in their aggressiveness. Among the three species, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae appeared to be more aggressive compared to C. godetiae.

A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides.

            "In studies conducted in Israel, researchers aimed to determine whether avocado anthracnose was caused by the same subspecies of C. gloeosporioides responsible for almond anthracnose, particularly since almond groves are located alongside avocado plantations in certain cultivation areas. Similarly, other crops, such as anemone, apple, mango, and strawberry, are known to be susceptible to Colletotrichum in Israel. To evaluate the potential for cross-infection, isolates from different crops were cross-inoculated on various hosts.",
            "Our study demonstrated that C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond, apple, avocado, and mango, as well as C. acutatum isolates from almond, anemone, apple, and peach, were able to infect detached fruits of other hosts, including two varieties of apple, avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine. These results indicated cross-infection potential between two species: C. gloeosporioides (including representatives of distinct subpopulations from almond, apple, avocado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach), across a variety of fruit species. However, these experiments were conducted under extreme conditions typical of artificial inoculations, whereas isolations from naturally infected fruit provided no evidence of cross-infection occurring under field conditions.",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato is a significant pathogen responsible for mango anthracnose globally. In some cases, C. acutatum sensu lato has also been linked to the disease. Phylogenetic analyses based on internal transcribed spacer (ITS) sequences reveal that C. gloeosporioides comprises diverse groups or sub-populations, suggesting that other Colletotrichum species may also be associated with mango anthracnose. Studies indicate that Colletotrichum isolates from mango can consist of pathogenically and genetically distinct populations of C. gloeosporioides. According to Ploetz (1999), the C. gloeosporioides population on mango has a restricted host range and is highly virulent solely on mango. Following the phylogenetic analyses of the Colletotrichum genus by Phoulivong et al. (2012) and Weir et al. (2012), several species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes, including C. gloeosporioides, have been associated with mango anthracnose.",

            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",
            "Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes have been made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). However, the biological characteristics, such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum species, remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). High temperatures and their frequency can delay or even prevent the onset of plant diseases (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). Conversely, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature plays a vital role in disease emergence.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. infect a wide diversity of hosts, causing plant diseases in many economically important crops worldwide. The genus contains approximately 189 species organized into at least 11 major phylogenetic lineages, also known as species complexes. The Colletotrichum acutatum species complex is a diverse yet relatively closely related group of plant pathogenic fungi within this genus. Within this complex, we find a wide variety of important traits such as host range and preference, mode of reproduction, and differences in strategies used to infect their hosts. Research on fungal comparative genomics has attempted to find correlations in these traits and patterns of gene family evolution; however, such studies typically compare fungi from different genera or even different fungal orders. The C. acutatum species complex contains most of this diversity within a group of relatively closely related species.",

            "Colletotrichum acutatum was identified by Simmonds (1965) and validated by the same author in 1968. Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).",

Colletotrichum acutatum causes significant economic losses in temperate, subtropical, and tropical crops, with global populations exhibiting considerable genotypic and phenotypic diversity.",
            "Discussion: Recent phylogenetic studies of the genus Colletotrichum have revealed clustering in 11 major clades, including significant species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. boninense, C. gloeosporioides, and C. truncatum.

            "The perceived lack of host specificity in the C. acutatum complex likely has multiple causes, but a significant issue stems from inadequate identification practices in pathology studies. Many investigations still avoid including sequence-based evidence or rely solely on ITS sequences, with only a few depositing adequate voucher material. This leads to less rigorous name usage than is necessary, resulting in misleading outcomes and poor comparability between studies. It must be acknowledged that many, if not most, of the species recognized through multigene analyses do not seem to be restricted to particular plants.",
            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen."

Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished).

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

            "Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

            "In recent years, genome sequences for 28 species of Colletotrichum have been published, and comparative genomic studies have concentrated on genes associated with pathogenicity (Gan et al., 2013), host specialization (Baroncelli et al., 2016; Gan et al., 2016), and transitions between biotrophic and necrotrophic lifestyles (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012), as well as between endophytic and parasitic lifestyles (Hacquard et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016). Comparative analyses of secretomes have revealed that most predicted secreted proteins possess enzymatic activity, with many identified as candidate effectors (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016; Sanz-Mart\u00edn et al., 2016). The host range of Colletotrichum species seems to be linked to gene loss or gain in families encoding carbohydrate-active enzymes (CAZymes) and proteases (Baroncelli et al., 2016). Notably, gene families encoding proteases and carbohydrate-degrading enzymes are significantly expanded in Colletotrichum compared to other Sordariomycetes (Gan et al., 2013; Baroncelli et al., 2016), indicating the increased importance of these families in the infection processes of Colletotrichum species. Transcriptional profiling experiments have also shown that CAZymes, along with other classes of secreted proteins, are highly modulated during the infection process, further implicating them as critical players in pathogenicity (Kleemann et al., 2012; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012).",
            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

            "Observations and measurements of conidial size and shape have usually been made using conidial masses mounted in water, cotton blue, or lactic acid (Cannon et al., 2008). It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex. In contrast, C. hymenocallidis appressoria are ovate or sometimes clavate.",
            "Colletotrichum hymenocallidis: The size and shape of conidia in Colletotrichum hymenocallidis are similar to those of C. siamense; however, their colony characteristics differ. The reverse of C. siamense is yellowish-white, while that of C. hymenocallidis is greenish-black. The conidial and mycelial appressoria in C. hymenocallidis are larger than those in C. siamense (Prihastuti et al., 2009). Based on phylograms derived from CHS I and combined datasets of six genes, these species occur in two distinct clades (Fig. 2). Although the size and shape of conidia in C. gloeosporioides are similar to those of C. hymenocallidis, the latter grows slower under the same conditions (10 mm/day for C. hymenocallidis compared to 26.5 mm/day for C. gloeosporioides) (Cannon et al., 2008). In both single and combined gene trees, C. hymenocallidis formed a distinct lineage separate from C. gloeosporioides (Figs. 1, 2).",
            "Conidia are formed directly from the germ tube of a germinating primary conidium, and these are smaller and more irregular in form than those from which they are derived (Buddie et al. 1999). Additionally, older strains, especially if they have been frequently subcultured, may exhibit more variable conidia in appearance than those derived from recent stock. Nirenberg et al. (2002) observed that shapes differed among conidia formed in acervuli and in the aerial mycelium. The variation in conidial shape has led to species within the C. acutatum complex being incorrectly placed into synonymy with other Colletotrichum species, primarily C. gloeosporioides\u2014this is a legacy of the revision of the genus by von Arx (1957). His work marked a new era in the understanding of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue), but many of the synonymies proposed were inaccurate.",
            "Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characteristics. Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always sufficient for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species due to variations in morphology and phenotype influenced by environmental factors.",

            "Available morphological characters of Colletotrichum species include: 1) characters on natural substrates, such as size and shape of conidiomata (acervuli), conidia, conidiophores, and setae; 2) size and shape of conidia, conidiophores, and setae in culture; and 3) size and shape of appressoria. Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966). Morphological characters may vary with environmental factors, and incubation conditions, such as media and temperature, should be standardized (Cannon et al., 2000) for species comparison and identification.

            "According to Nirenberg et al., a typical feature of C. lupini is its conidial morphology, with spores having one pointed end and one rounded. We also observed this feature when the fungus grew on Anthriscus stems. However, the conidia from the ex-neotype strain observed in this study on SNA originated from simple or branched conidiophores at the agar surface and the aerial mycelium, rather than from conidiomata, as the strain no longer produces defined acervuli on this medium. Conidia from aerial mycelium are approximately cylindrical and can be variable in size, sometimes with both ends rounded (Nirenberg et al. 2002).",
            "Recently, more focus has been placed on conidium morphology, particularly shape and dimensions. The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013). The revision of the C. acutatum complex has recognized 31 species through a multilocus molecular approach, significantly advancing our understanding of these plant pathogens (Damm et al. 2012)."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",
            "Recently, the genomes of more than 20 Colletotrichum species have been sequenced (O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Alkan et al., 2013; Gan et al., 2013, 2016, 2017; Baroncelli et al., 2014a,b, 2016; Hacquard et al., 2016; Han et al., 2016; Hiruma et al., 2016; Queiroz et al., 2017), revealing significant diversity in genome architecture and gene content. While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum acutatum is recognized as a significant anthracnose pathogen affecting a broad range of host plants globally. Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.",

This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.",

These terms are synonymous with race-non-specific and race-specific resistance, respectively. In pathosystems where race-specific resistance occurs, an incompatible interaction between the host and pathogen often requires a dominant host resistance gene and a dominant pathogen avirulence gene. Such interactions are described by the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Race-non-specific resistance is less understood but is believed to be governed by multiple host genes that incrementally contribute to the overall resistance of the plant. Vanderplank proposed using analysis of variance to determine the contribution of race-non-specific and/or race-specific resistance within a host population against a group of pathogen isolates. The absence of a cultivar by isolate interaction is evidence of race-non-specific resistance using this method. A cultivar by isolate interaction suggests that race-specific mechanisms contribute to the resistance observed within the host population, although deviations from additivity could be responsible for the statistical interaction. Deviations from additivity arise from the scale used to measure resistance, while rank changes are consistent with physiological responses.",

Deletion of the signal peptide of Nis1 abolished its cell death activity, indicating that Nis1 is recognized in the apoplasts of N. benthamiana.

Surprisingly, deletion of NIS1 had no significant effect on the infection behavior of C. orbiculare on N. benthamiana.

In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",

Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

            "Strawberries, perhaps the most delectable of fruits, are grown for their attractiveness and exquisite flavor in most temperate and many tropical areas of the world. Some believe the world would indeed be a dull place without strawberries to excite the taste buds and enliven desserts and pastries. Strawberry cultivation can be traced back thousands of years, with origins in Europe well documented in literature and art. Fragaria vesca L. (diploid, 2n=14 chromosomes) and F. moschata (hexaploid, 2n=42 chromosomes) were cultivated in palace and church gardens. Strawberry culture in the New World, particularly in North and South America, is less well documented. North American natives appreciated the springtime appearance of F. virginiana Duchesne (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) fruit, although this species was likely not cultivated until Europeans began exploring and settling in North America. However, native inhabitants of Chile and Peru had selected and cultivated superior variants of F. chiloensis (L.) Quebe- sene (octaploid, 2n=56 chromosomes) well before the arrival of conquistadors in the 16th century.",

            "The result of the latter option (\u20146merpair \u2014addfragments) is shown in Figures 2D and E. The difference between D and E lies in the order of sequences; the sequences were reordered according to similarity using the \u2014reorder option in E. In this alignment, ITS1 and ITS2 are clearly separated and aligned to appropriate positions in the full-length alignment. Moreover, this strategy is computationally much less expensive (CPU time = 15 min [first step] + 1.5 min [second step]) than the full application of L-INS-i (CPU time = 98h). The former option (\u2014multipair \u2014addfragments) also returns a similar result to the latter (\u20146merpair) but is slower (CPU time = 48.6 min [second step]).",
            "This case suggests that selecting a strategy appropriate to the problem of interest is crucial. The most time-consuming method, L-INS-i, is not always the most accurate one. The difficulty of this problem for standard approaches arises from the fact that ITS1 sequences and ITS2 sequences are not homologous to each other, making most pairwise alignments impossible. Due to these non-homologous pairs, the distance matrix used for guide tree calculation is not additive; the distances between ITS1 and full-length sequences, and those between ITS2 and full-length sequences are close to zero, whereas the distances between ITS1 and ITS2 are quite large. In this situation, it is difficult for normal distance-based tree-building methods to yield a reasonable tree. Additionally, during the alignment step, the objective function of L-INS-i is affected by inappropriate pairwise alignment scores between ITS1 and ITS2. Such issues can be avoided by simply ignoring the relationship between ITS1 and ITS2, as done in the \u2014addfragments option.",
            "Figure 2 illustrates ITS alignments using different options of MAFFT, displayed on Jalview (Waterhouse et al. 2009). Panels (A) and (B) show incorrect alignments produced by the FFT-NS-2 and L-INS-i algorithms, respectively. Panel (C) depicts an incorrect alignment made with mafft-profile. Here, the full-length sequences were aligned using the L-INS-i algorithm, and each new sequence was subsequently added to this alignment using mafft-profile. Panel (D) presents a more reasonable alignment achieved through a two-step strategy, utilizing the \u20146merpair and \u2014addfragments option in the second step. Panel (E) is a reordered version of (D), with sequences arranged such that similar sequences are grouped closely. All calculations were performed using 16 cores on a Linux PC with a 2.67GHz Intel Xeon E7-8837 and 256 GB RAM.",

Several tools (Berger and Stamatakis 2011; Lo\u0308ytynoja et al. 2012; Sun and Buhler 2012) for this purpose were developed between 2011 and 2012. A limitation of the \u2014add option in MAFFT for this purpose was highlighted by Lo\u0308ytynoja et al. (2012). Consequently, we introduced a new option, \u2014addfragments, which does not take into account the relationships among the sequences being added.

            "Accepted 20 August 2007. To overcome taxonomic problems associated with traditional identification methods, DNA sequence analyses were used to characterize and resolve the taxonomic complexity of some fungal genera, such as Fusarium (O\u2019Donnell et al., 1998), Pestalotiopsis (Jeewon et al., 2004), and Colletotrichum (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005). Cannon et al. (2000) stated that data derived from nucleic acid analyses should provide the most reliable framework for classifying Colletotrichum, as DNA characters are not directly influenced by environmental factors. In particular, sequence analysis of the ITS regions proved useful in studying the phylogenetic relationships of Colletotrichum species (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1996; Photita et al., 2005).",
            "Molecular tools are increasingly being utilized for day-to-day identification by biosecurity officers and plant pathology researchers, highlighting the need for a taxonomy that accurately reflects genetically resolved groups, along with simple and reliable protocols for identifying those taxa. The internal transcribed spacer region (ITS) has been proposed as the official fungal barcoding gene (Schoch et al. 2012). While ITS is useful at the species complex level, it is ineffective at resolving species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, identifying only 10 out of 22 accepted species. This limitation arises from the low number of base changes in the ITS region across the complex, where species are often differentiated by just one or two base changes. In some cases, random variation in the ITS sequence within or between species results in certain species being indistinguishable. Examples of taxa with identical ITS sequences include C. clidemiae, C. tropicale, C. ti, and some others.",
            "To address the limitations of profile alignment, we implemented an option called \u2014add in 2010, allowing the addition of unaligned sequences to an existing multiple sequence alignment (MSA). This option assumes that each new sequence is derived from a branch in the tree of an existing alignment, as illustrated in Figure 1D. The \u2014add option works similarly to the standard progressive method, except that the alignment calculation is skipped at the nodes whose children are all part of the existing alignment.",

Crouch et al. (2009) revealed a high error rate and a frequency of misidentification (86%) based on ITS sequence similarity comparisons within the C. graminicola species complex. ITS sequence data in the public domain can create significant confusion for end users; sequences are often entered under incorrect specific names and may represent several cryptic species. Identical sequences have frequently been recorded under different names.",

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).",

Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have also proven unsuccessful in clearly delineating species, partly due to the high number of erroneous names in GenBank. This paper reviews the taxonomic problems associated with Colletotrichum and the difficulties in identifying taxa at the species level. We advocate for epitypification and the use of multi-locus phylogenetic methods to better delimit species and understand the genus.",

It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000).

            "Prior to the availability of DNA sequence data, taxonomic concepts were based on host specificity and morphological features such as colony growth rate, color of cultures, conidial size and shape, and the shape of appressoria. However, many of these morphological features can change with repeated subculturing or vary under different growing conditions. Therefore, it is insufficient to identify fungal species solely based on morphological features (Weir et al. 2012). Penzig (1882) first proposed the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, which was collected from citrus in Italy. Von Arx (1957) defined C. gloeosporioides as the anamorph of all fungi with the G. cingulata teleomorph and artificially expanded the spore size range for C. gloeosporioides to overcome the instability of spore morphology from different hosts or under different cultural conditions.

These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017). Notably, the Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose produced pigments that varied in color among species and isolates. Additionally, these species differed in their ability to form a sexual morph in culture.",
            "Differentiation of C. acutatum from Other Species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species."

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini. The biological diversity of the C. acutatum species complex, coupled with the presence of closely related species exhibiting varied characteristics such as host range, mating behavior, and spectrum, makes C. acutatum a suitable model for investigating genomic signatures associated with changes in crucial phenotypic traits of fungal plants.",

This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",

            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "Results from several studies suggest that Colletotrichum acutatum may have evolved into a subgroup that is highly virulent and host-specific to strawberries. In one such study (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 2002), 95 isolates of Colletotrichum, including 81 isolates of C. acutatum (62 from strawberries) and 14 isolates of C. gloeosporioides (13 from strawberries), were characterized using various molecular methods and pathogenicity tests. Analyses based on random amplified polymorphic DNA (RAPD) polymorphism and internal transcribed spacer 2 (ITS2) sequence data provided genetic evidence for two subgroups within C. acutatum.",
            "According to Ji et al. (2022), the global diversity of Colletotrichum spp. that are virulent to strawberry was illustrated with identification records supposed to be at the species level. Reports on the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose that could not be confidently identified at the species level were excluded.",

            "Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.",

            "Conclusions drawn by Hindorf (1973) revealed significant morphometric overlap in conidial size among various Colletotrichum species. Pring et al. (1995) noted that wounding greatly enhances Colletotrichum's ability to cause disease. Oh et al. (1999) emphasized the role of cuticular wax layers in the susceptibility of green and red pepper fruits to infection. They highlighted that differentiation of C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici was reliable when based on appressorial shape. However, it was challenging to delineate species by appressorial characteristics alone, as a negative correlation was found between cuticle thickness and disease incidence for C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.",
            "Differentiation of C. acutatum from Other Species of Colletotrichum. Morphological characteristics such as colony morphology, conidial shape, presence or absence of setae and sclerotia, and appressoria shape and size have been employed to differentiate species in the genus Colletotrichum. However, these morphological traits can be highly variable among isolates and are often subject to interpretation. Other distinguishing characters, such as growth rates and sensitivity to benomyl, have also been useful. C. acutatum shows moderate sensitivity to benomyl, with concentrations of 0.1 to 1.0 \u00b5l/ml causing 20 to 50% growth inhibition, while these concentrations are usually completely inhibitory to other Colletotrichum species. However, C. acutatum is more sensitive to benomyl compared to resistant isolates of other Colletotrichum species.",
            "Corresponding to the taxonomic classification determined by multi-locus phylogenetic analyses, most Colletotrichum species exhibited characteristic morphological features, including colony colors, the density of aerial mycelium, and the shapes and sizes of conidia, ascospores, appressoria, and setae (Fig. 7\u201318). These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017). Notably, the Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose produced pigments that varied in color among species and isolates. Additionally, these species differed in their ability to form a sexual morph in culture.",

However, in China, the identification of Colletotrichum species on mango has mainly relied on conidial morphology and ITS sequences, and the combined data remain limited and insufficient to distinguish closely related taxa in the six species complexes mentioned above.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",
            "In the greenhouse assay, the occurrence of anthracnose symptoms in strawberry plants inoculated with Colletotrichum nymphaeae PET1 was notably low after four months. Statistical comparisons showed no significant differences among strawberry cultivars in terms of disease incidence and severity. Only one replication of each treatment (cultivar) exhibited anthracnose crown rot.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach."

Therefore, it is insufficient to identify fungal species solely based on morphological features (Weir et al. 2012). Penzig (1882) first proposed the name Colletotrichum gloeosporioides based on Vermicularia gloeosporioides, which was collected from citrus in Italy. Von Arx (1957) defined C. gloeosporioides as the anamorph of all fungi with the G. cingulata teleomorph and artificially expanded the spore size range for C. gloeosporioides to overcome the instability of spore morphology from different hosts or under different cultural conditions.

Three replicate cultures of each isolate should be examined. After 7 days, conidial size and shape from more than 25 conidia should be measured and recorded, and colony characteristics can be documented and photographed (Than et al., 2008a). Observations and measurements (e.g., conidial size, appressoria size, and conidiogenous cells) should be conducted in water mounts.

A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...",

The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.",

The presence of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberries in the U.S. in 1986 and is now widespread, causing major economic losses in production fields. This fungus had previously been reported as the cause of anthracnose fruit rot in strawberries in Queensland, Australia, in 1965 and is now found in most regions where strawberries are cultivated. Both Colletotrichum fragariae and C. gloeosporioides cause anthracnose crown rot, a destructive disease in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern U.S. Both species can also lead to petiole lesions and leaf spots. Anthracnose diseases are increasingly significant, resulting in major economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",

Additionally, the development and registration of more effective fungicides for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses from both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also diminished economic losses due to these diseases.

Previously, different species in this group could only be reliably distinguished using multigenic phylogenetic analyses. Using a comparative genomics approach, we developed a marker to differentiate Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum aenigma, and Colletotrichum siamense within the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on PCR amplicon size differences. When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing different species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberries in Japan and contributes to our understanding of the diversity of anthracnose pathogens in the country.",

Species complexes such as C. acutatum, C. amagnum, C. aorchidearum, C. boninense, C. dracae- nophilum, and C. gloeosporioides have been separated into many different species using morphological and molecular techniques. However, in China, the identification of Colletotrichum species on mango has mainly relied on conidial morphology and ITS sequences, and the combined data remain limited and insufficient to distinguish closely related taxa in the six species complexes mentioned above. Previous research on Colletotrichum species affecting mango has primarily focused on samples from small and fragmented provincial areas, leading to poor representation of the actual species diversity in the vast mango-growing regions of China.",
            "It is widely accepted that high genetic variation exists within Colletotrichum species complexes due to their broad host range and diverse environments. Mango anthracnose has been associated with various Colletotrichum species. This study aimed to accurately identify the species in the Colletotrichum-mango system in Thailand through a combination of morphological assessments, multilocus sequence analyses, and Koch\u2019s postulates. A total of 37 Colletotrichum species were isolated from mango anthracnose in orchards across central Thailand. Using morphological characteristics such as colony color, growth rate, and the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, 32 isolates were identified as C. acutatum, while five were identified as C. gloeosporioides. Morphological characteristics alone are generally deemed insufficient for species identification, as variations among species can appear similar under different environmental conditions; thus, a multilocus phylogenetic approach was integrated to assist in taxonomy."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "During the 2001\u20132002 season, isolates were grouped into four categories based on their average aggressiveness toward the four cultivars tested (as detailed in Table 5). Isolate 97-15A was identified as the most aggressive, while isolates 95-63A, 97-45A, and 97-47C displayed relatively high and comparable levels of aggressiveness. Isolates 98-285 and 97-63 were less aggressive, with 97-63 being the least aggressive of the two. In the following season, 2002\u20132003, these isolates were re-evaluated alongside others, resulting in the formation of four isolate clusters based on aggressiveness. The rankings among isolates remained consistent, although 98-285 and 97-63 were not significantly different from each other. Isolates 00-59 and 96-83R were found to be highly aggressive, while 96-83H, a non-strawberry isolate, was the least aggressive. For the 2003\u20132004 season, isolate 00-59 was again identified as highly aggressive, with isolate 02-172 being more aggressive than isolate 96-15A and ascospore isolate 00-117. In separate analyses comparing inoculated plots to uninoculated controls, all isolate treatments exhibited significantly more crown rot than the controls (data not shown).",
            "During the 2003\u20132004 season, the ascospores isolate was among the least aggressive, although it matched the aggressiveness of one of the crown rot isolates. In contrast, during the 2002\u20132003 season, the grape isolate was less aggressive than those from strawberry crowns. This may indicate that more aggressive isolates are selected within the C. gloeosporioides population on strawberries. The C. fragariae isolate from oak exhibited greater aggressiveness and had a similar virulence pattern to the isolate from strawberry, providing further evidence that C. fragariae from strawberry is derived from a population with a broad host range, as the oak isolate was collected 28 km away from any strawberry production area.",
            "Isolates of Colletotrichum gloeosporioides from strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) and native grape were tested for virulence on strawberry cultivars in field experiments over three seasons. Isolate aggressiveness and cultivar resistance were determined by the proportion of plants killed at a defined time. Each year, four to six isolates were inoculated on four to seven different cultivars, with a subset of isolates and cultivars evaluated again the following season. On the dates that disease was evaluated, incidence ranged from 10% to 84% for individual cultivars. Cultivar and isolate effects were significant in all three seasons, but there was no significant cultivar by isolate interaction in any season. Thus, resistance to C. gloeosporioides appears to be nonspecific. In the third season, one isolate of Colletotrichum fragariae from strawberry and one from oak were included. There was no significant cultivar by isolate interaction detected for this species, although there were significant differences among cultivars and isolates. When comparing the resistance of cultivars to both species, the rankings were similar, but a modest cultivar by species interaction was evident. The cultivar 'Treasure' was more resistant to crown rot caused by either species than any other cultivar tested.",
            "For the 2001-2002 season, F-values for the cultivar \u00d7 isolate interaction and cultivar alone were significant (<0.001).",

The variation in aggressiveness among different isolates was evident from the incidence rates, which ranged from 8.33% to 100%, with only four out of 38 isolates showing incidence rates of 91.7% to 100%. Lesion types varied, ranging from 0.1 to 3.0 (see S1 Table). Upon evaluating lesion morphology, different types of lesions could be distinguished on fruits, ranging from brown lesions containing orange conidia to those fully covered with aerial mycelium, varying in size. The isolate C. nymphaeae CSL 899 was the most aggressive on strawberry fruits, with the highest disease index (3.0), indicating symptoms covering more than 66% of the fruit surface.",
            "For C. fragariae, two isolates are shown, with isolate 02-135 reporting an incidence of 40.9% in the first year and isolate C-16 showing a lower incidence of 24.7% in the following year. This data highlights the differences in aggressiveness among the isolates and the varying levels of disease resistance in the tested strawberry cultivars.",
            "Pathogenicity tests were conducted following Mo et al. Select isolates were used for pathogenicity and aggressiveness tests on detached leaves and fruits of mango (cv. Tainong) under controlled conditions. Each isolate was incubated on PDA for 7 to 10 days at 25\u00b0C. Freshly harvested mango fruits and young leaves without visible disease from Tiandong (Guangxi province) were utilized for the tests. The tissues were surface sterilized in 75% ethanol for 30 seconds, followed by 1% NaClO for 1 minute, and rinsed three times in autoclaved distilled water. After air drying, detached healthy leaves (12-15 cm) were placed in plastic containers (9 cm \u00d7 17 cm \u00d7 25 cm) lined with paper toweling, and six stab wounds were made to form a 5-mm diameter circle. Mycelial plugs (6 mm diameter) from the margins of PDA cultures were placed on each wound. This completely randomized trial included three replicates per isolate, with sterile agar plugs serving as controls. The containers were sealed and incubated in the dark at 25\u00b0C. Aggressiveness was assessed one week after inoculation by measuring lesion diameter.",
            "Pathogenicity trials conducted over three years using 12 distinct C. gloeosporioides isolates and 10 strawberry cultivars identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates. However, they failed to identify any cultivar by isolate interactions. A more limited study using two C. fragariae isolates inoculated on six strawberry cultivars during the third year also identified differences in disease resistance among the cultivars and differences in aggressiveness among the isolates, but similarly did not reveal any cultivar by isolate interaction. When the resistance rankings of cultivars were compared between the two pathogen species, a small but significant cultivar by species interaction was observed.",
            "All 128 tested isolates were pathogenic to wounded mango leaves and fruits. The aggressiveness of these isolates on mango fruits differed significantly, with lesion diameters ranging from 0.54 cm to 3.64 cm (see Supplementary Table S3). Based on the diameter sizes of the disease spots, aggressiveness was classified as strongly virulent (>2 cm), moderately virulent (>1.0 to <2 cm), or weakly virulent (<1.0 cm). Among the 128 isolates investigated, 66 (52%) were moderately virulent, 9 (7%) were strongly virulent, and 53 (41%) were weakly virulent. The least virulent strain was C. siamense SC16, while the most virulent strain was C. siamense GD7-1 (see Supplementary Table S3).",
            "Colletotrichum acutatum s.l. isolates displayed varying levels of aggressiveness on both host tissues. In fruit assays, among the three species identified from UK strawberry production systems, C. nymphaeae and C. fioriniae were more aggressive compared to C. godetiae. This was particularly notable for isolates originating from strawberry, as indicated by the fruit disease index range: C. nymphaeae (2.08\u20133.00), C. fioriniae (1.92\u20132.75), and C. godetiae (0.75\u20132.08). Interestingly, for isolates from other hosts, C. nymphaeae isolates were less aggressive (0.67\u20131.67), while one or more isolates of C. fioriniae (2.00\u20132.17) and C. godetiae (2.17) exhibited disease indices similar to those of the strawberry isolates. Among other species tested within the C. acutatum complex, C. acutatum sensu stricto (s.s.), C. simmondsii, and Colletotrichum sp. 2 included one or more isolates from non-strawberry hosts that showed medium levels of aggressiveness, with a fruit disease index ranging from 1.17 to 2.08. In contrast, C. lupini (0.08\u20130.75), C. phormii (0.58), C. salicis (0.17\u20130.67), and C. rhombiforme (0.67), along with Colletotrichum sp. 1 (0.33) from various non-strawberry hosts, were much less aggressive, as indicated by the fruit disease index. The C. gloeosporioides s.l. isolates tested showed a fruit disease index ranging from 1.50 to 2.50 (see Table 3)."

This is partly due to a lack of certainty about the biological relationships between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",

It highlights the prevalence of anthracnose fruit rot in Iran and assesses the susceptibility of 52 commercial cultivars against the pathogen. The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",
            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems.",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "To provide practical information for the management of strawberry anthracnose, we updated the host ranges of C. fructicola and C. siamense through a search on the Fungal Database (conducted on July 8, 2022, at https://nt.ars-grin.gov/fungaldatabases/) and determined the taxonomy of these hosts (conducted on July 15-16, 2022, at https://www.iplant.cn/). This analysis revealed a significantly wider range of hosts for C. siamense and C. fructicola than previously suggested in earlier publications (da Silva et al. 2020; Bhunjun et al. 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021)."

Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010).

            "Disease Etiology and Host Specificity Determining the specific species of Colletotrichum responsible for anthracnose is critical for effective disease management. Relying solely on the species-host combination can be misleading. Therefore, taxonomic identification and characterization of subpopulations are essential to establish a clear understanding of disease dynamics.",
            "Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, causing disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum, each with a brief description. In recent years, molecular tools have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Some species have been segregated from the C. gloeosporioides complex based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, such as C. boninense.",
            "However, clade-based calibration can also provide advantages. Anthracnose diseases are often attributed to several Colletotrichum species within the same clade, depending on the region. For example, the main causal agents of olive anthracnose are found in the acutatum clade, with C. godetiae being dominant in Spain, Italy, Greece, and Tunisia; C. nymphaeae prevalent in Portugal; and C. oriniae predominant in California (Moral et al., 2021). Furthermore, accurate identification of Colletotrichum species necessitates molecular analysis of multiple DNA regions (Damm et al., 2009; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2013; Damm et al., 2014). Since species within the same clade often exhibit similar environmental requirements (Salotti et al., 2022), a clade-based calibration may help address knowledge gaps regarding individual Colletotrichum species, facilitate practical model usage when species identification is challenging due to capacity or economic limitations, and enable predictions across a diverse range of hosts and climatic conditions.",
            "Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions (Cannon et al. 2012). The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight major plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three species or species complexes of Colletotrichum have been reported to cause anthracnose in strawberries: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae have narrower host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a few C. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al. 2016).",
            "Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. impacts a wide variety of woody and herbaceous plants, particularly tropical and subtropical crops and fruit trees (Cannon et al. 2012; Freeman et al. 1998; Hyde et al. 2009; Sutton 1992; Wikee et al. 2011). The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect. Understanding of Colletotrichum spp. has significantly advanced through these molecular approaches.",
            "Colletotrichum Corda is one of the most economically important genera of fungi, responsible for anthracnose and other diseases affecting a wide range of plant species (Sutton, 1980; Hyde et al., 2009). The need for species recognition is therefore a significant practical concern in the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species (Shenoy et al., 2007). However, considerable difficulties have arisen in Colletotrichum systematics due to the lack of reliable morphological features, which makes species boundaries ambiguous and confusing. Traditionally, many Colletotrichum species have been named after their host, suggesting host specificity among species.",

            "Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.",

            "Mango (Mangifera indica) is regarded as one of the most significant tropical or subtropical fruit crops (Nelson 2008). In China, it is primarily cultivated in the southern and southwestern provinces, with a planted area of nearly 130,000 hectares, yielding approximately 900,000 tons in 2012 (Li et al. 2013). Guangxi province is the largest mango-producing area in China, significantly contributing to the local economy (Li et al. 2013). Anthracnose, caused by several Colletotrichum species, is recognized as the most critical disease affecting mango in China (Hong et al. 2016). While Colletotrichum gloeosporioides is the primary causal agent, Colletotrichum acutatum has also been reported (Freeman et al. 1998; Jayasinghe and Fernando 2009; Phoulivong et al. 2010). Symptoms of mango anthracnose include irregularly shaped, black necrotic spots on both the upper and lower sides of mango leaves, with lesions also appearing on stalks and flowers. The most significant damage occurs during ripening and postharvest stages, when black lesions develop on mango fruit surfaces (Arauz 2000; Freeman et al. 1998).",

The Mediterranean countries rank second only to China in fruit production and are the largest fruit exporters after South Africa (FAO 2016). Therefore, understanding all pathogens affecting this crop is imperative. The current study aimed to investigate the major citrus production areas in Europe through large-scale sampling and to identify isolates using a polyphasic approach. This method revealed many cryptic and new Colletotrichum species associated with citrus, classified into four modern taxonomic species complexes. Surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 across commercial nurseries, orchards, gardens, and plant collections aimed to determine the occurrence of Colletotrichum spp. related to citrus and allied genera (Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, Poncirus). The study's specific objectives included conducting extensive sampling of fresh plant materials, cultivating Colletotrichum isolates, subjecting these isolates to DNA sequence analyses alongside morphological characterization, comparing results with other phylogenetic studies, and evaluating the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species on citrus fruit. Major diseases of citrus caused by Colletotrichum species include postbloom fruit drop (PFD), petal necrosis, and key lime anthracnose (KLA), with C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides being significant agents.

            "Present and Future Management of Anthracnose: Fungicides, including chemicals such as benzimidazoles (e.g., thiabendazole, benomyl, and carbendazim) and sterol inhibitors (e.g., imazalil, prochloraz, and propiconazole), have been used effectively to control anthracnose disease in banana, mango, papaya, and avocado plants [140]. Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "There is an urgent need for multi- and single-site fungicide alternatives effective against anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and production fields. The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018). A request has been submitted through the Interregional Research Project Number 4 for its registration for nursery use only. Reducing the overlap of the same modes of action used during nursery and fruit production phases could help extend the lifespan of single-site fungicides at high risk of resistance.",
            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).",
            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",
            "Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.",
            "Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action. Natural products have also been evaluated as alternative fungicides, offering different modes of action, lower toxicity, and increased efficacy (Abril et al., 2008).",
            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",
            "The application of fungicides is a common practice to control anthracnose in mango orchards in Thailand, but it often proves unsuccessful. This ineffectiveness may stem from the emergence of new Colletotrichum species and/or the development of fungicide resistance among the pathogens.",
            "Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides."

            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.",
            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",

These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf. Morphological characteristics determined their identity as C. nymphaeae, confirming it as the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in Iran, consistent with previous reports (Karimi et al., 2017).

            "From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.",

Additionally, cases of anthracnose caused by C. nymphaeae in Korea have been observed in kiwiberries, Japanese plums, and persimmons.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production.

Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch.

            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach."

            "Phylogenetic analyses using molecular markers have revealed that many members of the genus Colletotrichum can be grouped into independent lineages with similar evolutionary histories (Cai et al. 2011). Several of these lineages have now been systematically classified as species complexes comprising closely related sibling species (Weir et al. 2012). Many species within the C. gloeosporioides species complex have previously been classified as C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, largely based on morphological characteristics and known host range (Hyde et al. 2009). Additionally, the study by Weir et al. (2012) showed that ITS sequences, which have long been used to classify fungal species, are not very reliable in distinguishing different species within this species complex. However, different species do not require the same level of control when encountered in the field (Prihastuti et al. 2009).",
            "The general evolutionary trend emerging in the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex indicates that distinct populations are undergoing significant changes in their host association patterns. This may suggest a role of behavioral switching in mating and changes in host associations. The occurrence of heterothallism appears to influence host range diversity, while isolates capable of homothallism, such as C. salicis and C. phormii, exhibit a narrower host range. This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",

        "retrieved_context": [
            "As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.",
            "Colletotrichum fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States, causing crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern U.S. Generally, C. fragariae causes more severe petiole and crown symptoms than C. acutatum, and some researchers consider it to be a host-specific or con-specific form of C. gloeosporioides (Howard, 1983; Howard et al., 1992; Sutton, 1992).",
            "Colletotrichum species cause severe diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops globally, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant threat in strawberry nurseries and production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). The first report of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, C. acutatum, in the United States was documented in 1986 (Smith and Black, 1986). Increased losses attributed to anthracnose fruit and crown rots in the U.S. since the 1980s may be associated with a transition from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production, as well as changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are becoming increasingly important, leading to significant economic losses for strawberry growers worldwide. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding studies from California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",
            "Colletotrichum species cause serious diseases in many fruit and vegetable crops worldwide, with C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides being responsible for anthracnose diseases in strawberries (Smith and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthracnose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and C. gloeosporioides has been a significant issue in strawberry nurseries and fruit production fields in the southeastern United States (Brooks, 1931). In 1986, the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen C. acutatum was first reported in U.S. strawberries (Smith and Black, 1986). The increase in anthracnose-related losses since the 1980s is likely due to the shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture systems and changes in cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are gaining importance, leading to major economic losses for strawberry growers globally. This report aims to summarize anthracnose-related research from the United States (excluding California and Florida) to enhance understanding of these diseases and their control.",
            "ABSTRACT: Strawberry anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum fragariae, is a serious problem in the southeastern United States, resulting in significant losses in strawberry nurseries. Control measures using fungicides are crucial, particularly with recommended applications of captafol, benomyl, captan, and maneb.",
            "Clonal isolates were analyzed to confirm or reject the hypothesis of host specialization of CA-clonal isolates on strawberry. Sreenivasaprasad et al. (26) suggested that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberry are distinct from U.S. C. acutatum isolates found in a variety of hosts. In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California. Freeman and Katan (7) also observed identical RAPD patterns in pathogen isolates from both countries, suggesting that C. acutatum was introduced from the United States into Israel.",
            "The name C. fragariae was originally applied to isolates associated with a disease affecting strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) runners (stolons) and petioles in Florida (Brooks 1931). Although it was placed in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957), it has continued to be referenced in the literature for strawberry-associated Colletotrichum isolates. Sutton (1992) accepted it as distinct, although he noted the confusion surrounding the application of the name. The designation of one of Brooks\u2019s cultures (CBS 142.31 = IMI 346325) as the epitype of C. fragariae by Buddie et al. (1999) has provided a modern genetic basis for this name. The ex-epitype culture of C. fragariae is positioned in a strongly supported clade containing isolates from a diverse range of hosts worldwide, including the ex-epitype culture of C. theobromicola, which is regarded as an earlier name for C. fragariae as accepted in this paper.",
            "Acutatum (Gunnell and Gubler, 1992). Since host origin was deemed less important, von Arx (1957) placed C. fragariae in synonymy with C. gloeosporioides. However, researchers have generally retained the name C. fragariae when dealing with the pathogen on strawberries (Howard and Albregts, 1984; Mass and Howard, 1985; Sutton, 1992). Gunnell and Gubler (1992) reported that C. fragariae could be clearly distinguished from C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides by its morphology on strawberry leaf agar. Delimitation of these species remains problematic because literature references to C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides may actually refer to other species (Shivas and Tan, 2009; Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1994).",

            "Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes have been made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). However, the biological characteristics, such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum species, remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). High temperatures and their frequency can delay or even prevent the onset of plant diseases (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). Conversely, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature plays a vital role in disease emergence.",
            "The resistance of strawberry plants to C. fragariae is influenced by environmental conditions following inoculation. Plants incubated at a high temperature (35 \u00b0C) for 48 hours at nearly 100% relative humidity exhibited more severe disease symptoms than those incubated at 25 or 30 \u00b0C (Smith and Black, 1987). Further incubation at 32 \u00b0C resulted in more severe symptoms compared to incubation at 25 \u00b0C. Tissue culture-induced (somaclonal) variation is another strategy pursued for generating disease-resistant genotypes (Hammerschlag et al., 2006).",
            "Our model is weather-driven, accounting for the effects of temperature, wetness duration, and rainfall on the epidemiological components leading to disease development. It operates with an hourly time step to better account for fluctuations in temperature, as well as in wetness duration and interruptions that directly influence the epidemiological processes. This ensures more accurate and robust predictions compared to models that operate with a daily time step (Scherm and Van Bruggen, 1994; Narouei-Khandan et al., 2020). However, to be incorporated into our model, new information must be provided at an hourly time step.",
            "Smith and Black (1987) discovered that resistance to C. fragariae was influenced by environmental conditions post-inoculation. Plants incubated at a high temperature (35\u00b0C) for 48 hours in a dew chamber (with relative humidity near 100%) exhibited higher disease severity ratings compared to those incubated at 25 or 30\u00b0C. Additionally, plants maintained in a greenhouse at 32\u00b0C after dew chamber incubation displayed more severe symptoms than those kept at 25\u00b0C. Notably, two- to four-week-old strawberry seedlings (measured after transplanting at the first true-leaf stage) were more susceptible to C. fragariae than 14- to 18-week-old seedlings when inoculated with a conidial suspension (Smith et al., 1990).",

However, as discussed previously (Madden, 1992; Madden et al., 1996), efforts to quantify properties of rain in relation to disease outbreaks or rates of disease development have yielded mixed results. Even when rain occurs, other weather variables, such as temperature, may correlate with disease variables just as strongly or even more so than rain itself. Given the complex effects of rain intensity, it is unsurprising that predicting disease increases based solely on rainfall is challenging.",

This extended summer contributed to the outbreak of several diseases, including anthracnose crown rot, leading to increased mortality after transplanting in strawberry production fields. It is concerning to speculate that global warming may exacerbate the threat of anthracnose to strawberry production. However, changes in temperature and other climate factors can have positive, neutral, or negative effects on disease development, depending on the specific responses of the disease triangle to these variations (Vel\u00e1squez et al. 2018). In an era of anthropogenic habitat modification and climate change, we must consider how to mitigate the impacts of global warming on sustainable strawberry development.",
            "For the dematium clade, three disease progress curves on mulberry in Japan were used to validate the model (Table 2). Epidemics developed on mulberry leaves between August and November, with final disease incidence ranging from 13% to 37%. In the comparison of observed and predicted disease progress curves, the concordance correlation coefficient (CCC) ranged from 0.862 to 0.991, and the root mean square error (RMSE) ranged from 0.014 to 0.055. Across all three epidemics, CCC was 0.95, RMSE was 0.036, and the calibration regression model (CRM) was -0.023, indicating a slight tendency toward overestimation (Table 5). An example of model output for the dematium clade is shown in Figure 4 for JA-94. Disease assessment began in June after the summer pruning of mulberry trees and ended in November. During this period, the average daily temperature was 21.9\u00b0C (minimum = 7.0\u00b0C, maximum = 30.1\u00b0C), with an average relative humidity (RH) of 82%. There was a total of 625.5 mm of rain over 61 rainy days, and a total of 1688 hours of leaf wetness (Figure 4A). Regularly distributed rainfall ensured that the epidemic would progress during the season, starting from the time of disease onset in August until November, when a sharp increase in disease led to a 37% disease incidence (Figure 4B). The model correctly predicted this dynamic; across all three epidemics, CCC was 0.991, RMSE was 0.02, and CRM was 0.078.",

            "In the soybean pathogenicity bioassay, the efficiency of infection was determined for C. truncatum pathotype F8-3B pAA1 transformants, lacking cutinase, five days after inoculation (DAI). Cutinase silenced transformants exhibited different percentages of reduction in infection efficiency on soybean leaves. The mean percentage of infection reduction was normalized against the wild type, with different letters above the bars indicating significant differences based on the analysis.",
            "The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.",
            "The soybean pathogenicity bioassay revealed varying levels of soybean leaf infection when inoculated with various selected F8-3B-pAA1 transformants. These observations confirmed that the disturbance of the CtCut1 gene via RNA-mediated gene silencing (knockdown) altered the pathogenicity of the transformants. Indeed, the relative expression of the five selected F8-3B-pAA1 transformants showed different levels of CtCut1 transcription compared to the control wild type in the qRT-PCR assay. Lower levels of CtCut1 transcripts translated to reduced infection. Similar observations were noted in the Pyrenopeziza brassicae-Brassica napus system, where mutants lacking cutinase transcript expression failed to penetrate.",
            "The study, published in the Journal of Plant Pathology and Microbiology (ISSN: 2157-7471, Volume 6, Issue 3), examined the role of cutinase and its impact on the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum truncatum (Auyong et al., 2015, doi:10.4172/2157-7471.1000259). It was likely that the only gene affected by the pAA1 hairpin was CtCut1. The pAA1 plasmid was versatile, containing restriction enzyme sites that facilitated the creation of a hairpin cassette for silencing any gene, provided the primers used were designed with compatible restriction enzyme sites. The success of this silencing was predicted to be partially enhanced by the relatively short 57-bp intron sequence in the pAA1 plasmid, as short intron sequences have been reported to provide stable and high silencing frequencies in Magnaporthe oryzae, sometimes leading to complete silenced phenotypes.",
            "Taken together, these results demonstrate that the pAA1 plasmid is efficient and applicable for inducing gene silencing in most genes and Colletotrichum species. The observation indicated that the silencing of the cutinase gene may have altered the pathogenicity of the transformants. More durable and novel forms of disease control can be implemented when knowledge of the pathogenicity genes that trigger resistance is made available through this alternative genetic tool approach.",
            "In contrast, Skamnioti et al. [53] reported the existence of multiple cutinase families in Magnaporthe grisea, Fusarium graminearum, Botrytis cinerea, Aspergillus nidulans, and Neurospora crassa. They achieved RNA-mediated gene silencing in C. truncatum using a hairpin plasmid, specifically pAA1, which incorporated a short fragment of sGFP along with CtCut1 as the silencing target. This method allowed for variable but efficient knockdown of the cutinase gene in C. truncatum.",
            "To achieve successful pathogenicity, fungi employ various infection strategies to breach the host cuticle. Some pathogens utilize mechanical means through specialized infection structures, while others penetrate the cuticle directly with the assistance of extracellular cutinase activity. Colletotrichum truncatum, a pathogen of legumes, cereals, grasses, and vegetable crops such as Capsicum species, is an ascomycete that infects its host through direct penetration of the host cuticle. The infection and penetration process is believed to be triggered by cutin-degrading enzymes such as cutinase. Numerous cutinases have been isolated and characterized from different fungi. These enzymes are suggested to play roles in carbon acquisition for saprophytic growth, as well as in fungal penetration and surface adhesion.",
            "The intron sequence used to form the hairpin in the pAA1 plasmid derived from the cutinase gene of C. truncatum, which likely reduced the possibility of organism rejection. Proper regulation of RNA-silencing machinery, enabling high levels of gene silencing, was anticipated. In contrast, Praveen et al. reported that the use of intron sequences from non-related organisms might yield lower gene silencing efficacy.",
            "Cutinase has been proposed as the hydrolyzing agent of the plant cuticle and/or an elicitor of cutin monomers, which trigger signaling pathways within fungal pathogens. Despite the identification of cutinase in various Colletotrichum species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. kahawae, C. trifolii, C. lagenarium, and C. capsici, the characterization of the gene and its function in the C. truncatum-chili interaction remains unexplored.",
            "Studies on gene function through specific inhibition of pathogenicity or plant-fungal interaction gene expression using RNA-mediated gene silencing have been reported in many ascomycete fungi, including Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, Magnaporthe oryzae, and Colletotrichum lagenarium. However, this silencing mechanism has not yet been employed in C. truncatum to understand its pathogenicity."

The results indicate varying resistance levels among the cultivars tested, with specific cultivars like 'Camarosa' showing notable sensitivity compared to others such as 'Gaviota' and 'Pajaro.' This study aims to provide insights into the resistance profiles of these cultivars against the anthracnose pathogen, contributing to better management strategies in strawberry cultivation.",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges.",
            "A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.",

Harvesters are contracted to work in various ferneries and may harvest from multiple fields and farms within the same day. The transport of conidia on clothing, tools, and equipment is believed to be a major mechanism by which the fungus spreads rapidly within and between ferneries.

Our results demonstrate that conidia can persist on clothing for periods that create a significant potential for long-distance transport and introduction into uninfested ferneries.",

Considerable research is still needed to translate controlled-study findings into field applications. For instance, it is not yet known how to formally link spore dispersal to rainfall properties (e.g., intensity) integrated over the duration of rain episodes. Controlled studies have not yet provided adequate guidance on the effects of variations in rain intensity during a rain event, despite it being well established that intensity varies highly over time.

These methods include arbitrarily primed polymerase chain reaction (ap-PCR) and polymorphisms in nuclear DNA, ribosomal DNA (rDNA), mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), and A+T-rich DNA. Although almond and avocado crops are grown in close proximity in Israel, where anthracnose from C. gloeosporioides affects both crops during the spring season, it remains uncertain whether cross-infection occurs in the field. Additionally, strawberry, which is also susceptible to C. acutatum, is cultivated in the same regions and climatic conditions as the avocado and almond crops.",
            "rDNA genes exist as multiple copies in the genome. Due to the lesser conservation of sequence, the non-transcribed and internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions between the small and large nuclear rDNA subunits are suitable for detecting recent evolutionary divergence within Colletotrichum. In our study, limited restriction digest analyses of PCR-amplified rDNA were utilized to differentiate representative isolates of C. gloeosporioides from a diverse range of hosts, as well as from rDNA of C. acutatum sourced from strawberry. Species-specific primers have been designed based on the dissimilarities in the sequences of the ITS regions from various Colletotrichum species. We employed such primers to differentiate between C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides. As shown in Figure 5A, a single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range but was absent in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae amplified a specific 450-bp fragment, allowing these two species to be distinguished from C. acutatum. This method also facilitated the differentiation between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus. These findings indicate that rDNA analysis serves as an effective taxonomic tool for species identification and diagnostic pathogen detection in plants, although it may not reveal subpopulations within a species.",

            "QoI resistance was first described in C. acutatum from strawberries in Florida in 2013 (Forcelini et al. 2016). The G143A and F129L mutations in cytb were identified, conferring high and moderate resistance levels, respectively. In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011). Additionally, this mutation has been shown to be stable in C. acutatum populations and did not result in a fitness penalty in laboratory assays (Forcelini et al. 2018). In our study, QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were similarly pathogenic; however, disease severity and mortality after inoculation with resistant isolates were higher than those for QoI-sensitive isolates. Several studies on other fungal pathogens have indicated that resistant isolates harboring the G143A mutation did not exhibit reduced fitness compared to wild-type sensitive isolates (Corio-Costet et al. 2011; Karaoglanidis et al. 2011; Rallos et al. 2014). In contrast, the fitness of resistant isolates of Magnaporthe oryzae was reduced (Ma and Uddin 2009).",
            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

This evolutionary trend suggests that the capacity of populations to exchange genetic information leads to genomic rearrangements, thereby increasing genome plasticity and expanding the host spectrum of this pathogen.",

A plant pathogen population with high genetic variability can evolve rapidly, and this information is essential for predicting the longevity of control measures (McDermott & McDonald, 1993). Furthermore, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial for effective control strategies based on fungicides, as some species are more sensitive to specific chemical groups than others (Freeman et al., 1998; Wong & Midland, 2007; Sanders et al., 2000). For example, C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is considered highly sensitive to benomyl, whereas C. acutatum (s. lat.) is comparatively resistant (Freeman et al., 1998). However, individual species within these complexes need to be tested for sensitivity to specific fungicides.

Indeed, the co-occurrence of C. fructicola and C. siamense has been identified in the same strawberry production field in Shanghai (Liu et al. 2021). The combined host range of these two Colletotrichum species was expanded to 152 genera, which includes one gymnosperm, 12 angiosperms (from six orders), 38 monocots (from 10 orders), and 101 dicots (from 22 orders). Among the combined hosts of C. fructicola and C. siamense, the top four orders are Fabales, Sapindales, Rosales, and Asparagales, each containing 12, 12, 11, and 11 genera, respectively.",
            "In summary, a total of 23 Colletotrichum species have been accepted as strawberry pathogens, including nine species from the C. gloeosporioides complex (C. aenigma, C. alienum, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides s.s., C. kahawae, C. siamense, C. viniferum, and C. theobromicola), seven species from the C. acutatum complex (C. acutatum s.s., C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. miaoliense, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii), two from the C. boninense complex (C. boninense s.s. and C. karstii), two from the C. dematium complex (C. lineola and C. dematium s.s.), and one from the C. truncatum complex (C. truncatum s.s.), as well as the two singletons C. nigrum and C. coccodes. Optimal markers for identifying distinct Colletotrichum species can be found in recent publications (Vieira et al., 2020; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Jayawardene et al., 2021). Undoubtedly, the catalog of Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries will expand in the future.",
            "There exists high genome plasticity in Colletotrichum species, enabling them to adapt powerfully (Gan et al. 2021). Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). These associations between strawberry pathogens and humans highlight the importance of biosecurity in scientific research and agricultural practices.",

A typical strain of C. nigrum from Fragaria spp. petioles in the UK was previously identified in a study aimed at circumscribing distinct anthracnose pathogens of several crops (Liu et al., 2013). C. coccodes, which causes strawberry fruit rot, was reported in Australia (Shivas et al., 2016).

            "The exact way mineral nutrients influence disease is uncertain, but effects on pathogen activity and host susceptibility are likely involved. Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997)."

Furthermore, many of these models have never been validated against independent data (i.e., data not used in model development). In contrast, mechanistic models have a flexible structure, high explanatory ability, and the capability to make predictions across a wide range of agricultural contexts. As a result, mechanistic models are considered useful for decision-making in Integrated Pest Management (IPM) (De Wolf and Isard, 2007; Rossi et al., 2019). Recently, Ji et al.

            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.",
            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) is one of the main limiting factors for the strawberry production industry worldwide, including Iran. Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first study evaluating the reaction of commercial strawberry cultivars to C. nymphaeae causing strawberry AFR.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",
            "The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers. However, as acreage expanded, anthracnose crown rot (ACR) has emerged as a significant challenge for strawberry producers. In March 2016, typical symptoms of ACR were observed in the 'Strawberry Festival' cultivar at a farmer's field in the Rajshahi district of Bangladesh. Symptoms were apparent in approximately 10% of the plants, manifesting as wilting of entire plants during the heat of the day and flagging of young leaves, resembling water deficiency.",
            "When N fertilizer is applied to strawberry plants as Ca(NO3)2, anthracnose crown rot severity should be less than when N is applied in ammonium forms. Anthracnose crown rot, caused by the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae, can infect all above-ground parts of the strawberry plant. Petiole and stolon infections are characterized by dark, sunken lesions, while leaf infections present as small black spots. When the crown is infected, it can lead to wilting and rapid plant death. An internal symptom of a crown infection is red discoloration, typically extending in a \u201cV\u201d shape from the side of the crown toward the center. Other pathogens such as Colletotrichum gloeosporioides and C. acutatum also cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries.",
            "The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all regions where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often lead to stunted plants rather than plant death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and produce few berries at harvest.",

            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",
            "The capability of the isolates to produce crown rot symptoms was evaluated by injecting the crowns of three-month-old strawberry plants (see Fig. 3C) with 0.2 mL of conidial suspension using a syringe. The plants were placed in a glasshouse at 23\u00b0C with a 16-hour light and 8-hour darkness cycle. After 24 days post-inoculation (d.a.i.), the plants were evaluated for the presence of crown tissues exhibiting red-brown discoloration, wilting, and collapse, which are typical symptoms of Colletotrichum crown rot. The severity scale for this evaluation was as follows: 0 for no lesions; 1 for crown tissue discoloration without wilting or collapse; 2 for wilting or collapse of part of the plant; and 3 for plant death. All crowns were sectioned and examined for the presence of red-brown lesions (see Fig. 3D). Crown infection was confirmed through the re-isolation of the pathogen. Three plant crowns injected with SDW, as well as untouched plants, served as negative controls for each replicate. The experiment was independently replicated three times, with six plants per replicate."

        "retrieved_context": [
            "The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are all favored by longer periods of wetness than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia to form. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves when exposed to flower extracts than when exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), suggesting that C. acutatum inoculum levels on strawberry foliage may increase during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia are spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally declined as plant density increased, concluding that higher plant density reduced the amount of rain that penetrated the plant canopy, thus reducing splash. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, which is an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "This study highlights that temperature and the duration of intermittent wetness significantly affect germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development of C. acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves. The optimal temperature range of 23 to 27\u00b0C for conidial germination aligns with previous findings regarding the growth of C. acutatum in culture and its impact on strawberry fruit. Increased conidial lysis at 35\u00b0C might explain the decreased conidial populations observed under continuous wetness at this temperature. Previous research on the effects of wetness duration on C. acutatum has mainly focused on strawberry fruit or in vitro studies, noting increased fruit rot incidence with longer wetness duration and reduced germination at relative humidity below 91%. In this study, longer wetness periods also favored conidial germination, which was notably low during shorter daily wetness periods of 4 hours.",
            "The germination and sporulation of Colletotrichum acutatum were characterized over time on strawberry leaves (cv. Tristar) and plastic coverslips incubated at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness. Conidia germinated within 3 hours after inoculation and formed melanized appressoria with pores by 9 hours after inoculation. Host penetration was not observed up to 7 days after inoculation. Production of secondary conidia on conidial surfaces began within 6 hours after inoculation. Secondary conidiation was responsible for up to a threefold increase in the total number of conidia within 7 days after inoculation. Primary conidia and hyphae began to collapse 48 hours after inoculation, whereas melanized appressoria remained intact. These findings suggest that appressoria and secondary conidia of C. acutatum produced on symptomless strawberry foliage may be significant sources of inoculum for fruit infections.",

Detached immature fruits were inoculated with a conidial suspension and incubated for up to 36 days at constant temperatures of 5, 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35\u00b0C. The latent period (the time until the first sporulation) varied with temperature, ranging from 2 to 3 days at 25\u00b0C to 6 to 17 days at 5\u00b0C. At lower temperatures (5 and 10\u00b0C), C. acutatum exhibited a shorter latent period compared to the other species, while at higher temperatures, the latent periods among the species were similar.",

            "Surprisingly, free surface moisture was not required for sporulation. However, free moisture is necessary for the infection of fruit by Colletotrichum acutatum (35) and is essential for the sporulation of many other fungal pathogens affecting fruit (11, 17). In related research, Nicholson and Moraes (25) concluded that the density of conidia in acervuli of Colletotrichum graminicola, the cause of anthracnose in corn, was higher under high relative humidity (RH) than under low RH due to the lack of desiccation of the spore matrix. Although some studies have investigated spore germination and dispersal (24, 29, 37, 38), surprisingly, there have been few published reports on the direct influence of environmental conditions on spore production. Therefore, it remains unknown whether other Colletotrichum species are similarly affected by moisture. We speculate that the pathogen acquires sufficient moisture from ripening strawberry fruit to produce conidia.",

            "C. acutatum conidia typically germinate by forming germ tubes and appressoria. However, conidia can also germinate by forming conidial phialides, which are specialized conidiogenous structures that produce secondary conidia without extensive mycelial growth. We recently reported that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods, resulting in up to a threefold increase in conidial populations on the leaf surface. In this study, conidial populations increased by up to tenfold on strawberry leaves when germination occurred in the presence of strawberry flower extracts. This suggests that ungerminated conidia exposed to flower extracts have a greater capacity to produce secondary inoculum on strawberry leaves than conidia germinating in water. The cause of the observed stimulatory effect is not clear, but it may be associated with nutrients or other stimulatory substances in the extracts. The stimulatory effects of flower extracts on C. acutatum multiplication were even more pronounced on coverslips, where conidial populations increased by up to sixteenfold. Excess nutrients and microorganisms on the leaf surface may have attenuated the effects of the extracts on leaves compared to coverslips. Nutrient deficiency, for example, has been associated with the induction of secondary conidiation by fungi such as Helminthosporium sativum and C. gloeosporoides in response to the inhibition of hyphal development. A stronger effect of nutrients in vitro than on host surfaces was also noted by Parbery and Blakeman in germination studies with C. acutatum.",
            "On strawberry plants, C. acutatum primarily causes black spot disease on the fruit but can also affect crowns, roots, and leaves (Freeman & Katan 1997), making it one of the most serious diseases in commercial fruit production. The conidia are formed in acervuli on the host, while in culture, they can also be produced in the aerial mycelium (Johnston & Jones 1997). C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on living strawberry leaves, stimulated by extracts from the strawberry plant, especially flower extracts (Leandro et al. 2001; Leandro et al. 2003). According to Buddie et al. (1999), secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia, and these are generally smaller and more variable in shape, which can obscure the differences between taxa. Additionally, C. acutatum forms simple pigmented appressoria but has few or no setae (Simmonds 1965)."

Based on our findings, we propose an alternative perspective on the evolutionary relationships among the studied species.

In the text, these primers have been designated as (CAG)5, (GACAC)3, and (GACA)4, respectively. PCR primers for the detection of the pathogen in planta included the ITS4 primer (TCCTCCGCTTATTGATATGC) coupled with the specific primer for C. acutatum (CaInt2) (GGGGAAGCCTCTCGCGG) (5). PCR reactions were performed in a total volume of 20 \u00b5l, containing 10 to 100 ng of genomic DNA, 50 mM KCl, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 0.2 mM each of dATP, dCTP, dGTP, and dTTP, 1.5 mM MgCl2, 1 unit of Taq DNA polymerase (Promega Corp., Madison, WI), and 1 \u00b5M primer. The reactions were incubated in a PTC-100 thermocycler (MJ Research Inc., Watertown, MA), starting with 5 minutes of denaturation at 95\u00b0C. For ap-PCR, this was followed by 30 cycles consisting of 30 seconds at 95\u00b0C, 30 seconds at either 60\u00b0C (for (CAG)5) or 48\u00b0C (for (GACA)4 and (GACAC)3), and 1.5 minutes at 72\u00b0C. C. acutatum-specific PCR reactions were performed under conditions for primer (CAG)5 with 0.5 \u00b5M ITS4 primer coupled with 0.5 \u00b5M primer CaInt2. Amplification products were separated in agarose gels (1.8% wt/vol; 15 \u00d7 10 cm, WXL) in Tris-acetate-EDTA buffer, electrophoresed at 80 V for 2 hours, stained with ethidium bromide, and viewed under UV light for detection of amplification products.",
            "Using markers outside the range of the C. gloeosporioides complex is likely to fail due to their highly variable nature, even in priming sites. For instance, the markers developed by Crouch et al. (2009a) to amplify partial fragments of the Apn2 gene and intergenic regions in the same locus for gramini-colous Colletotrichum species could not be utilized for the isolates analyzed in this study (data not shown). After obtaining homologous sequences from isolates of the C. gloeosporioides complex, alignments revealed significant divergence between the two species groups. However, these markers are more suitable than barcode genes for accurately dissecting and unraveling the diversity and evolutionary relationships in a complex of closely related species. Moreover, as Cai et al. (2009) noted, the selection and decision regarding the most suitable barcode gene(s) can only occur during the species delimitation process, as that is when we understand which taxa need to be distinguished. Thus, we first need to fully resolve the C. gloeosporioides complex using a set of highly informative genes before adequately searching for and selecting a barcode gene.",

            "For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).",
            "Abundant anthracnose infestation was evident in many nurseries during the summers of 1995 and 1996, resulting in a massive collapse of transplants in soil-fumigated fields. Plants that died within the first 3 to 4 weeks after transplantation are routinely replaced with new transplants. Moreover, as the plants are aligned with the drip irrigation system, the replacement plants are often placed in the same slots previously occupied by those that died, thus exposing them to the soilborne inoculum. Due to infestation in the nurseries, many farmers replanted infected but symptomless transplants in the same plots without refumigating the soil, significantly increasing the inoculum density. This situation was reflected in the high levels of C. acutatum populations in the rhizosphere of plants growing in naturally infested field soils. The unusual symptoms of root necrosis caused by C. acutatum may have resulted from root exposure to high inoculum density in the soil, compounded by the repeated use of contaminated propagation material. Stunted plants with decayed root systems were not infected by systemic invasion from inoculum originating from the crown (Fig. 1). While root necrosis caused by C. acutatum has not been widely reported, lesion development has been observed on roots following artificial dip inoculations (7). Furthermore, the pathogen was found to survive for up to 9 months in California soils (8) and to overwinter in fruit located above and below the soil surface in Ohio (37). Survival studies conducted in Israel indicated that populations of C. acutatum in artificially inoculated fruit buried for various periods in the soil decline rapidly (3 to 6 months) to untraceable levels (S. Freeman, unpublished data). Therefore, the likelihood of persistent soil contamination by a soilborne inoculum of C. acutatum appears low, especially since soil fumigation is a standard practice.",

            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",
            "As the primary source of infection in most fruiting fields appears to be infected transplants, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised after the anthracnose crown rot epidemics in the 1980s to obtain transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, areas believed to be outside the range of C. fragariae. However, C. acutatum has recently been detected in some nurseries in these regions. McInnes et al. (1992a) demonstrated that anthracnose-free transplants could be produced in the southeastern United States by situating nurseries in areas where strawberries are not grown commercially. Disease-free transplants are the primary method for controlling anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Since Colletotrichum spp. can infect various other hosts, initial infection in strawberry fields is sometimes thought to originate from these neighboring hosts. To investigate this hypothesis, Smith (2002) conducted a study with 37 Colletotrichum isolates representing nine species, wound-inoculating them onto the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "The application of fungicides to control strawberry anthracnose is limited due to restrictions on pesticide usage and the susceptibility of strawberry plants to Colletotrichum during all stages of development, including flowers, green, and ripe fruit. To reduce anthracnose infection in plant nurseries, it is essential to produce disease-free propagation material, which is a prerequisite for establishing disease-free nursery transplants. Control measures practiced in the United States involve frequent applications of fungicides.",

The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016).

Although the C. acutatum species complex is regarded as polyphagous, the lupin anthracnose pathogen forms a well-defined, homogeneous, and host-specific group, unlike other heterogeneous and polyphagous groups (Talhinhas et al., 2016). A similar situation applies to safflower (Carthamus tinctorius), where only strains of C. chrysanthemi were pathogenic to safflower. Strains genetically close but belonging to different species were not pathogenic on the same host (Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005; Baroncelli et al., 2015a). While approximately 7% of the scientific literature on Colletotrichum from 1991 to 2000 addressed C. acutatum, this proportion rose to 18% in the following decade, depicting C. acutatum as a \u201cpopular\u201d entity (based on an ISI Web of Science search of 1839 publications during 1991\u20132010 containing \u201cColletotrichum\u201d in the title). Other members of the species complex with a strong relationship to specific hosts include C. phormii, pathogenic to Phormium spp., and C. tamarilloi, the causal agent of tamarillo (Solanum betaceum) anthracnose (Baroncelli, 2012; Damm et al., 2012).",
            "Although C. acutatum usually produces necrotic symptoms of various types on most hosts, the host\u2013pathogen interaction appears to be more biotrophic compared to some other species, such as C. gloeosporioides. C. acutatum survives and competes poorly as a saprophyte in most cases. Nevertheless, it has been isolated from many plant species and is not always associated with disease. This species may colonize the surface of plant tissues as an epiphyte or endophyte under certain circumstances, on both hosts and non-hosts, without producing symptoms.",

            "Numerous light and electron microscopic studies describing plant interactions with Colletotrichum species have been published; however, we have not found studies on the ultrastructure of the C. acutatum and C. fragariae systems in strawberries. A detailed consideration of biotrophy, necrotrophy, and hemibiotrophy is essential for understanding the invasion mechanisms of C. acutatum and C. fragariae. Biotrophy is characterized by the fungus maintaining host cells alive while extracting nutrients from them (9, 16). Necrotrophy involves the fungus killing living host cells before entering their lumina (9, 12, 16, 28). Hemibiotrophy is a phase where the fungus initially engages in a biotrophic phase before transitioning to a necrotrophic phase (9). The initial penetration and invasion processes of a plant host by a fungal pathogen in the context of strawberry anthracnose are crucial for understanding these dynamics.",

            "Anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum species, is a serious disease affecting over 30 plant genera. Several DNA phylogenetic studies have identified Colletotrichum species that infect chili in various countries. Despite China being the largest producer of chili, with significant multi-gene analysis, little is known about the species affecting local crops. In this study, samples of diseased chili were collected from 29 provinces in China, resulting in the isolation of 1,285 strains. We observed and compared the morphological characteristics of all strains, and performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and HIS3) on selected representative strains. Fifteen Colletotrichum species were identified, with C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum being the most prevalent. Additionally, three new species, C. conoides, C. grossum, and C. liaoningense, are described in this paper. Colletotrichum aenigma, C. cliviae, C. endophytica, C. hymenocallidis, C. incanum, C. karstii, and C. viniferum were reported for the first time in chili. Pathogenicity was confirmed for all species isolated from chili, except for C. endophytica. This study enhances our understanding of the species responsible for anthracnose in chili and provides valuable information for effective disease management in China.",
            "Colletotrichum siamense is reported for the first time causing anthracnose of Capsicum annuum in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. This is also the first report of C. fructicola causing anthracnose of chili in Taiwan and Thailand, and C. plurivorum in Malaysia and Thailand. Of the species with straight conidia, C. scovillei (acutatum complex) was the most prevalent throughout the surveyed countries, except for Sri Lanka, from where this species was not isolated. Colletotrichum siamense (gloeosporioides complex) was also common in Indonesia, Sri Lanka, and Thailand.",
            "C. boninense, C. fructicola, C. siamense, and C. karstii have been isolated from diverse plants other than strawberry in various countries and regions. In Taiwan, C. fructicola has been reported as an anthracnose pathogen in mango, wax apple, and chili; C. siamense in lychee, star fruit, and mango; C. karstii in passion fruit; and C. boninense in pitaya. Previous studies have demonstrated that Colletotrichum species from strawberry are pathogenic to other crops and even weeds. For example, C. acutatum could infect pepper, eggplant, tomato, and bean, and could also latently colonize weeds such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp. In one study, C. fructicola was frequently isolated from leaves of Amaranthus blitum, and artificial inoculation of C. fructicola caused brown leaf spots on A. blitum. To determine whether weed control is necessary to minimize primary infection in the field, it is important to investigate whether the five Colletotrichum species identified could colonize weeds commonly found in and around strawberry fields in Taiwan. More sampling and artificial inoculation assays will be needed to understand the host range of the newly identified species C. miaoliense.",
            "Multigene phylogenetic analyses of Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of Capsicum in Asia showed high species diversity, identifying 11 different Colletotrichum species, including three novel species. Although C. siamense has been reported to infect many plant species before, this is the first report of C. siamense causing anthracnose in chili in Indonesia and Sri Lanka. Additionally, this is the first report of C. fructicola infecting chili in Thailand and Taiwan. All three novel species are new additions to the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose in chili. More surveys in countries in Asia and Oceania are needed to identify the diversity and prevalence of species causing chili anthracnose. Understanding the taxonomy and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. has significant implications for fruit and vegetable industries, particularly regarding the serious biosecurity concerns associated with the introduction of exotic pathogens.",
            "Taxonomic analysis of these straight conidia isolates, based on multi-gene phylogenetic analyses (ITS, gapdh, chs-1, act, tub2, his3, ApMat, gs), revealed a further seven known Colletotrichum species: C. endophyticum, C. fructicola, C. karsti, C. plurivorum, C. scovillei, C. siamense, and C. tropicale. In addition, three novel species are also described as C. javanense, C. makassarense, and C. tainanense, associated with anthracnose of chili fruit in West Java (Indonesia), Makassar (South Sulawesi, Indonesia), and Tainan (Taiwan), respectively.",
            "Based on published data, we discussed the prevalence of Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in China. C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex are currently the most prevalent. The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift in the prevailing Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in various regions may be linked to global warming, changes in cultivation patterns\u2014from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation\u2014and the substitution of strawberry varieties.",
            "All identified Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose belonged to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. Among these, we identified 48 isolates of C. fructicola, 21 isolates of C. siamense, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides, and 9 isolates of C. aenigma. Notably, C. siamense was distributed in the central and eastern regions of Zhejiang Province (Hangzhou, Jinhua, Shaoxing, Ningbo, and Taizhou). This is the first report of C. siamense causing strawberry anthracnose in Zhejiang Province. C. fructicola was identified as the most dominant species responsible for strawberry anthracnose in the region.",
            "Strawberry is a small fruit crop with high economic value. Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. poses a serious threat to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates; however, knowledge of pathogen populations in tropical and subtropical regions is limited. To investigate the diversity of infectious agents causing strawberry anthracnose in Taiwan, a disease survey was conducted from 2010 to 2018. Colletotrichum spp. were identified through morphological characterization and multilocus phylogenetic analysis, utilizing internal transcribed spacer, glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase, chitin synthase, actin, beta-tubulin, calmodulin, and the intergenic region between Apn2 and MAT1-2-1 (ApMAT). Among 52 isolates collected from 24 farms and nurseries in Taiwan, a new species, Colletotrichum miaoliense sp. nov. (6% of all isolates), a species not previously known to be associated with strawberry, Colletotrichum karstii (6%), and three known species, Colletotrichum siamense (75%), Colletotrichum fructicola (11%), and Colletotrichum boninense (2%), were identified. The predominant species, C. siamense and C. fructicola, exhibited higher mycelial growth rates on potato dextrose agar and caused larger lesions on both wounded and non-wounded detached strawberry leaves. Colletotrichum boninense, C. karstii, and C. miaoliense only caused lesions on wounded leaves. Understanding the composition and biology of the pathogen population will assist in disease management and resistance breeding."

Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",

Within the genus Colletotrichum, C. gloeosporioides s.l. is the most diversified complex, comprising as many as 57 species. This complex has been considered a heterogeneous species aggregate affecting over 700 plant species (O'Connell et al. 2012; Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021; Farr and Rossman 2022). The most prevalent species in Chinese strawberry fields, C. siamense and C. fructicola, belong to C. gloeosporioides s.l. They are the two most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species globally, with significantly more records in Asia compared to other continents. Both species can affect more than 70 genera of hosts widely distributed across the phylogenetic tree of angiosperms. Compared to C. fructicola, C. siamense infects significantly more plants, including one gymnosperm. Notably, some Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries can also infect members of other kingdoms beyond plant hosts. For instance, the prevalent C. siamense in strawberry fields has been reported as a human pathogen, causing skin lesions in immunocompromised individuals (Werbel et al. 2019). C. truncatum has also been identified as an opportunistic human pathogen (Valenzuela-Lopez et al. 2018), while C. dematium has been reported to infect human tissues such as the cornea (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021).

            "Many minerals in soils are negatively charged and can attract and retain cations such as potassium (K), sodium (Na), calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and ammonium (NH\u2084). Cation exchange is a reversible process, allowing nutrients to be held in the soil and not lost through leaching, with the potential for subsequent release for crop uptake. Certain organic compounds contribute to cation exchange capacity (CEC). The presence of high concentrations of Ca, especially in the form of gypsum, can interfere with the determination of CEC, which is crucial for soil fertility and mineralogical characterization. Additionally, CEC is influenced by soil pH. A certain portion of the total negative charge is permanent, while a variable portion is pH-dependent.",

This method allows for the extraction of soluble cations and anions and the estimation of other important parameters, such as Sodium Adsorption Ratio (SAR), which predicts Exchangeable Sodium Percentage (ESP). Criteria for boron (B) toxicity tolerance by various plant species have also been developed using such extracts (see Appendix 15). Therefore, a saturation extract is routinely utilized where salinity is a concern. The cations analyzed in saturation extracts include calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), potassium (K), and sodium (Na), while the anions comprise sulfate (SO4), carbonate (CO3), bicarbonate (HCO3), and chloride (Cl). Boron in saturation extracts is often measured when its toxicity is a concern.",
            "Soil testing has become an intrinsic part of modern farming practices in the West and in many developing countries. These tests primarily focus on the essential nutrients demanded by crops, which are typically supplied by fertilizers: nitrogen (N), phosphorus (P), and potassium (K). In some regions, particularly based on soil types, tests may also include secondary nutrients like calcium (Ca), magnesium (Mg), and sulfur (S). In arid areas, micronutrients such as iron (Fe), zinc (Zn), manganese (Mn), copper (Cu), and boron (B) are frequently measured, as deficiencies of these elements are often associated with calcareous soils. Furthermore, such regions may experience excessive or toxic levels of certain elements, such as boron (B) or high concentrations of sodium (Na) and magnesium (Mg), which can adversely affect soil physical properties. Because nutrient behavior in soils is influenced by soil properties and environmental conditions, measuring these properties is essential. Key measurements include pH, salinity, organic matter (OM), calcium carbonate (CaCO3), as well as texture and aggregate stability. In drier regions, the presence of gypsum (CaSO4\u00b72H2O) is also a concern.",

The soil retention of nutrients like phosphorus (P), manganese (Mn), zinc (Zn), and copper (Cu) is directly related to carbonate content and the distribution of total and active CaCO3 between clay and silt fractions. Consequently, the CaCO3 equivalent is typically determined in most laboratories. While some labs also determine \"active\" CaCO3, this is less common than measuring \"total\" CaCO3, mainly in areas influenced by French methodologies, as it was developed by Drouineau (1942) in France.

The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.",

Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.",
            "The form of nitrogen significantly influenced both the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and the growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg\u00b7L\u20131).",

Previous studies have only tested single concentrations of nitrogenous fertilizers and sodium chloride (Jarvis and Thorpe, 1980; Woltz et al., 1992), without examining the potential influence of other critical mineral nutrients, particularly microelements. The objective of our study was to compare the effects of several macro- and microelements (including various ammonium-N sources, nitrate-N, sodium phosphate, iron, molybdenum, and copper-, magnesium-, manganese-, and zinc-sulfates) on disease severity and the growth of tomato seedlings. Mineral nutrients were tested across a range of concentrations to provide more information for developing a fertilizer-based management strategy and for integrating mineral fertilizers with other control approaches (e.g., biocontrol) that may be sensitive to mineral levels.",
            "Evaluating the effect of combined phosphate and phosphite nutrition, Carswell et al. (3) found that adding phosphite (1.5 to 10 mM) to phosphate-limited Brassica nigra seedlings reduced plant growth. In phosphate-sufficient plants, only the 10 mM phosphite levels caused a reduction. Additionally, while the root-to-shoot ratios of phosphate-stressed plants were typically high (3, 11, 13), phosphite supplementation decreased the root-to-shoot ratio to about 40% of control values. Carswell et al. (3) explained these effects as a disruption of the phosphate-starvation response by phosphonates, causing phosphate-limited plants to behave as though they are phosphorus-sufficient. In our study, root-to-shoot ratios of tomato plants were also significantly lower for phosphorous acid-fertilized plants compared to no-phosphorus plants, indicating similar effects on phosphate metabolism. However, a combined treatment of 1 mM phosphate and 0.3 mM phosphorous acid increased leaf area significantly in two experiments, with a trend for greater leaf dry weight compared to phosphate treatment alone in three experiments. This finding might explain the labeling of commercial phosphite formulations as supplemental fertilizers for improved plant growth and increased crop yield. Additional studies are needed to evaluate possible interactions between phosphite and phosphate fertilizers. Phosphorous acid is readily absorbed by plants and is both xylem- and phloem-mobile (10). Using ion chromatography for quantifying phosphorous acid, Ouimette and Coffey (10) demonstrated that phosphonates are quite stable in avocado plants, persisting in this form for at least several months. Similarly, Robertson and Boyer (12) reported a biological inertness of organic and inorganic phosphites. In our experiments, phosphate concentrations in tomato plants treated with technical phosphite did not differ statistically from those of the no-phosphorus control plants. Phosphate levels in the solutions were not significantly different (P > 0.05) when freshly made or after one week in the recirculating hydroponic system, supporting previous work that molecular oxygen does not readily oxidize phosphonates in aqueous solutions (12). A general trend for higher phosphate levels was observed in the 1.0 mM phosphite solutions compared to the no-phosphorus treatment. In both fresh and aged solutions, measurable phosphate levels in the no-phosphorus and 1 mM phosphite treatments ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Contamination may have occurred from the salts used in the basic nutrient solution. In plants treated with a commercial formulation of phosphite, phosphate concentrations were significantly above those of the no-phosphorus treated plants. This increase could be explained by the slightly elevated phosphate levels in the nutrient solution. Decreased phosphate concentrations in the plant tissue of the 1 mM phosphate/0.3 mM phosphite treated plants compared to the 1 mM phosphate treated plants aligns with previous studies that showed growth of phosphate-sufficient plants in the presence of phosphite resulted in reduced root and leaf phosphate levels (3). The effect of phosphorus compounds on disease control was studied using P. capsici\u2013inoculated pepper plants. Plants grown with both formulations of phosphorous...",
            "Twelve mineral nutrients were tested separately for their influence on Fusarium crown and root rot, alongside a standard nutrient solution (without additional minerals) (Figs. 1\u20134). The disease progressed rapidly in affected seedlings, leading to significant development of the disease (mean rating of 3\u20134) in treatments supplemented with ammonium-N (Fig. 1), phosphate (Fig. 3), iron, zinc, manganese, and molybdenum (Fig. 4). At higher concentrations tested, infected seedlings often failed to emerge. Seedlings that showed no symptoms after 10 days typically remained healthy, even when left to mature (data not shown), likely due to the poor spread of the pathogen in rockwool (Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990). In all treatments, the fresh weight of seedlings was inversely correlated with the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot (Figs. 1\u20135), which supports previous observations regarding this disease (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1991; Woltz et al., 1992).

Lower temperatures are favorable for the development of crown and root rot, in contrast to warmer temperatures (approximately 28 \u00b0C), which favor Fusarium wilt (Jones et al., 1991). Millipore-filtered bi-distilled water (0.05 mm, Elgastat Ultra High Polishing unit, O. Kleiner AG, Wohlen, Switzerland) was added as needed to maintain a solution level of 1 to 2 cm. Fourteen days after planting, tomato seedlings were carefully removed from the rock wool with the upper 1.5 cm of the root system intact. They were weighed, and disease severity was rated on a scale of 0 to 4 (adapted from Mihuta-Grimm et al., 1990), where 0 = symptomless; 1 = slight brown discoloration of the upper root system; 2 = moderate brown discoloration affecting two-thirds or less of the upper root system; 3 = extreme brown discoloration of the upper root system with numerous necrotic lesions extending up the crown and stem; and 4 = seedling dead or nearly dead. Representative samples of necrotic tissue were plated onto Komada\u2019s selective medium (Komada, 1975) to confirm F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici as the cause of the symptoms."

            "Appressoria production was favored by cooler temperatures than conidial germination and secondary conidiation. The optimum for appressorial production ranged from 17.6 to 26.5\u00b0C and decreased over time after inoculation. For instance, although appressorial production was faster at 23 to 26\u00b0C six hours post-inoculation, the largest number of appressoria was observed at 17.6 to 20.8\u00b0C after 132 hours.

            "This study highlights that temperature and the duration of intermittent wetness significantly affect germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development of C. acutatum on symptomless strawberry leaves. The optimal temperature range of 23 to 27\u00b0C for conidial germination aligns with previous findings regarding the growth of C. acutatum in culture and its impact on strawberry fruit. Increased conidial lysis at 35\u00b0C might explain the decreased conidial populations observed under continuous wetness at this temperature. Previous research on the effects of wetness duration on C. acutatum has mainly focused on strawberry fruit or in vitro studies, noting increased fruit rot incidence with longer wetness duration and reduced germination at relative humidity below 91%. In this study, longer wetness periods also favored conidial germination, which was notably low during shorter daily wetness periods of 4 hours.",
            "The time from the infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to the first sporulation (the latent period) is crucial for understanding how quickly anthracnose may spread within a field. This latent period is temperature-dependent, ranging from 2-3 days at 25\u00b0C to 6-17 days at 5\u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5\u00b0C and 10\u00b0C, the latent period for C. acutatum was shorter than that for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent periods for all species were similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may significantly contribute to inoculum sources for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may help maintain inoculum availability throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a). Conidial germination, appressorial production, and secondary conidiation are favored by longer wetness durations than the 4 hours required for secondary conidia formation. Colletotrichum acutatum survived up to 8 weeks on leaves in greenhouse studies (Leandro et al., 2003a) and up to 5 weeks on fabric (Norman and Strandberg, 1997). More conidia formed on leaves exposed to flower extracts than those exposed to leaf extracts or water (Leandro et al., 2003b), indicating that inoculum levels of C. acutatum on strawberry foliage may rise during flowering. Rain splash is the primary means by which Colletotrichum spp. conidia spread from plant to plant in the field. Madden and Boudreau (1997) found that the incidence of anthracnose fruit rot generally decreased with increased plant density, concluding that higher density reduces rain penetration into the canopy and thus splash dispersal. Most fruit infections occurred within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997). Ntahimpera et al. (1999) studied splash dispersal of conidia from three Colletotrichum spp. and discovered that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while C. acutatum conidia traveled the farthest, likely due to a higher spore production on infected fruit. Colletotrichum acutatum conidia can survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but both conidia and sclerotia die quickly in moist conditions when soil moisture exceeds 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "The time from infection of strawberries by Colletotrichum spp. to first sporulation (the latent period) is an important factor in the speed at which anthracnose may spread within a field. The latent period depends on temperature and ranges from 2\u20133 days at 25 \u00b0C to 6\u201317 days at 5 \u00b0C (King et al., 1997). At 5 and 10 \u00b0C, the latent period was shorter for C. acutatum than for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae; however, at higher temperatures, the latent period for all species was similar. Appressoria and secondary conidia produced by C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may be a significant source of inoculum for fruit infections (Leandro et al., 2001) and may also contribute to the availability of inoculum throughout the growing season (Leandro et al., 2003a).

(1999) studied the splash dispersal of conidia from the three Colletotrichum spp. and found that C. fragariae conidia dispersed over the shortest distance, while those of C. acutatum dispersed over the longest distance. This was likely due to the greater number of spores produced on infected fruit by C. acutatum. Conidia of Colletotrichum acutatum may survive in soil and plant debris under dry conditions for up to 12 months, but conidia and sclerotia die rapidly under moist conditions, specifically in soil moisture levels exceeding 12% (Norman and Strandberg, 1997).",
            "Intermittent wetness affected conidial germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development at 25\u00b0C. Germination increased with the duration of wetness, and never occurred in the continuously dry treatment. The highest number of germinated conidia was observed one day post-inoculation in all treatments with eight hours of wetness per day, decreasing over time. Production of secondary conidia mainly occurred within one day after inoculation and was rare at later times. Total conidia were greater under continuous wetness than any other treatment one day post-inoculation, but tended to decrease over time.",
            "C. acutatum conidia typically germinate by forming germ tubes and appressoria. However, conidia can also germinate by forming conidial phialides, which are specialized conidiogenous structures that produce secondary conidia without extensive mycelial growth. We recently reported that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods, resulting in up to a threefold increase in conidial populations on the leaf surface. In this study, conidial populations increased by up to tenfold on strawberry leaves when germination occurred in the presence of strawberry flower extracts. This suggests that ungerminated conidia exposed to flower extracts have a greater capacity to produce secondary inoculum on strawberry leaves than conidia germinating in water. The cause of the observed stimulatory effect is not clear, but it may be associated with nutrients or other stimulatory substances in the extracts. The stimulatory effects of flower extracts on C. acutatum multiplication were even more pronounced on coverslips, where conidial populations increased by up to sixteenfold. Excess nutrients and microorganisms on the leaf surface may have attenuated the effects of the extracts on leaves compared to coverslips. Nutrient deficiency, for example, has been associated with the induction of secondary conidiation by fungi such as Helminthosporium sativum and C. gloeosporoides in response to the inhibition of hyphal development. A stronger effect of nutrients in vitro than on host surfaces was also noted by Parbery and Blakeman in germination studies with C. acutatum.",
            "Strawberry leaves (cv. Tristar) inoculated with Colletotrichum acutatum conidia were incubated at 10, 15, 20, 25, 30, and 35\u00b0C under continuous wetness, and at 25\u00b0C under six intermittent wetness regimes. The number of conidia and appressoria was quantified on excised leaf disks. To assess pathogen survival, inoculated leaves were frozen and then incubated to induce acervular development. Germination, secondary conidiation, and appressorial development were significantly affected (P < 0.05) by temperature and wetness duration.",
            "Primary inoculum consists of fresh conidia produced in acervuli under favorable conditions of temperature (10 to 30\u00b0C for most clades) and moisture (e.g., wetness periods longer than 6 hours) from overwintered sources throughout the cropping season (Moral and Trapero, 2012; Stensvand et al., 2017; Everett et al., 2018). Conidia are splash-dispersed by rain (Denham and Waller, 1981; Chakraborty and Billard, 1995; Madden et al., 1996; Madden, 1997; Guyot et al., 2005; Buirchell et al., 2006), deposited on plant surfaces, and germinate. The germ tubes then produce appressoria, which form infection pegs that penetrate the host cuticle and epidermal cell walls (Perfect et al., 1999). Penetration through stomata or wounds by germ tubes without appressoria formation is rare (Zulqarnain et al., 1996). Infection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after a symptomless biotrophic phase, leading to a necrotic phase in which host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow both intra- and inter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogen has a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), with the switch to the necrotrophic phase occurring only when host tissue and environmental conditions favor the continuation of the infection cycle. Except for a few species that exist entirely as endophytes, most Colletotrichum species develop a necrotrophic stage at some point in their life cycle (Prusky et al., 2013).",
            "For coverslip inoculation, conidial germination was also studied on plastic coverslips (22 \u00d7 22 mm). A 0.1-ml droplet of conidial suspension (5 \u00d7 10^3 conidia per ml) was deposited in the center of each of four coverslips placed on moistened filter paper in glass petri dishes. Each petri dish was sealed with Parafilm to maintain 100% relative humidity and incubated at 26\u00b0C in darkness. Coverslips were sampled at intervals similar to those for inoculated leaves and prepared for microscopic observation by mounting on slides and staining with a drop of 0.1% aniline blue in lactophenol. Conidial germination and appressorium development were quantified at \u00d7250 magnification as described for leaf disks. Four coverslips were counted for each sampling time, and the experiment was repeated once.",
            "Temperature significantly influenced the production of secondary conidia on the surface of symptomless leaves. The optimum temperature for secondary conidiation ranged from approximately 21.3 to 32.7\u00b0C between 12 and 36 hours after inoculation. Secondary conidiation was rare at 10\u00b0C and at sampling times beyond 36 hours. Production of secondary conidia increased the total number of conidia on symptomless leaves, particularly at 25 and 30\u00b0C, where total conidia more than doubled during the experiment. Although the number of germinated conidia began to decrease by 60 hours, this was counterbalanced by high numbers of ungerminated conidia produced by secondary conidiation at these temperatures."

            "Necrotrophic Lifestyle (Strawberry): Colletotrichum acutatum primarily exhibits a necrotrophic lifestyle on strawberry tissues. It affects flowers, fruits, leaves, and petiole tissues, and it can also produce root necrosis, which is quite unusual for this fungus. The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits. Primary inoculum for dispersal within fields largely depends on spore formation in acervuli on petioles and fruit tissues.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.",

            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",

C. acutatum was isolated consistently from each of these lesion types. Additional isolates, identified in our laboratory as C. acutatum, came from Florida (C. Howard) and Missouri (W.

Tioga plants with conidial suspensions (1.5 x 10^6 conidia/ml) of the Mississippi C. acutatum isolates resulted in fruit, petiole, and crown lesions, with wilting of crown-infected plants. Reisolations from each lesion type yielded isolates with characteristics of the one used to inoculate the host.

        "retrieved_context": [
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "Three species have been reported as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk). These species cause similar symptoms on strawberries, including crown rot, fruit rot, and stolon lesions. In Europe, C. acutatum is the most prevalent species causing anthracnose, while C. gloeosporioides is found only occasionally, and C. fragariae has not yet been observed.",
            "The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum. Strawberry anthracnose diseases have been reported to be caused by C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (the teleomorph of Cromereilla cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), and C. dematium (Pers.) Grove. The latter species only occasionally causes strawberry fruit rots and will not be discussed here.",

            "Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum are known to cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was initially assumed to be the causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the United States. This fungus had previously been documented as causing anthracnose fruit rot of strawberries in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it had likely existed in the United States for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "Colletotrichum is a genus of fungi that often causes anthracnose disease. In Japan and elsewhere, strawberry anthracnose has been attributed to infections by Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, which caused at least one major epidemic of anthracnose crown rot in the United States during the 1970s (Smith 2008; Suzuki et al. 2010). Anthracnose disease is a major problem in the Japanese strawberry cultivation industry, where infections are thought to be spread primarily through latently infected plants and infected plant material (Suzuki et al. 2010). The presence of even one infected plant can result in the infection of an entire field, highlighting the importance of early detection and classification.",
            "The anthracnose pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum J. H. Simmonds, poses a serious threat to strawberry production worldwide. All parts of the strawberry plant are susceptible to infection; however, fruit rot is particularly damaging in production fields, leading to significant yield losses. Anthracnose development in strawberry nurseries not only reduces daughter plant production but also has serious consequences for pathogen dissemination on contaminated transplants. Once C. acutatum is introduced into production fields, managing disease outbreaks becomes challenging, as available control measures are only partially effective. Consequently, the use of pathogen-free propagation material is highly desirable, though implementation is difficult due to the lack of adequate detection and certification schemes for C. acutatum on symptomless plants.",
            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach."

            "Pathogenicity testing is highlighted as a crucial step to determine whether a specific Colletotrichum species is host-specific or has a broader host range. Host-specific taxa may have limited distributions, which carry significant biosecurity implications. Conversely, species with a wide host range may be more cosmopolitan and potentially opportunistic pathogens. Koch\u2019s postulates have been applied to confirm the pathogenicity of various Colletotrichum isolates. For instance, studies have shown that C. acutatum causes Rhododendron anthracnose, while C. boninense was implicated in leaf infections of Euonymus. New species descriptions occasionally include data on pathogenicity testing, although this is not always the case. Further pathogenicity research is encouraged to validate findings across verified Colletotrichum species.",

            "Disentangling species complexes within the Colletotrichum genus presents a significant challenge for taxonomists. Given the global importance of this genus, primarily consisting of plant pathogens, it is critical to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to enhance biosecurity and disease control efforts. Traditional methods of species identification have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues. As stated by Sutton (1992), relying solely on morphology is insufficient for improving the systematics of species complexes like C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Previous reports indicated that the pathogenicity of most identified Colletotrichum species associated with pear anthracnose\u2014including C. aenigma, C. fructicola, C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. pyricola, and C. salicis\u2014showed no pathogenicity to pear fruits (P. bretschneideri cv. Huangguan) under unwounded conditions up to 30 dpi. These findings reveal a clear organ specificity regarding the pathogenicity of some isolates.",
            "Species descriptions will become standardized, and if morphological characters prove to be totally inadequate, they may be eliminated altogether. Pathogenicity testing will become essential to establish the biological role of these fungi. Colletotrichum has particular biosecurity importance, and until the genus becomes better defined, we suggest that plant quarantine authorities delay taking imprudent action. Many Colletotrichum species are proving to be widespread on a broad range of hosts, with some functioning as endophytes as well as pathogens. Many recently described species (e.g., in Prihastuti et al., 2009; Yang et al., 2009) are found to be prevalent on a variety of unrelated hosts, acting as endophytes, epiphytes, pathogens, or weak and opportunistic pathogens.",
            "Many of the species recognized in this work remain poorly understood in terms of their pathogenicity and host preference. This is partly due to a lack of certainty about the biological relationships between the fungi and the plants from which they were isolated. Species that are pathogenic on one host can also be isolated from others following opportunistic colonization of senescing tissue, as illustrated by the example of C. salicis discussed by Johnston (2000) under the name Glomerella miyabeana. The multiple Colletotrichum species associated with a single host likely exhibit a variety of life strategies: primary pathogens of healthy tissue, species capable of invading and causing minor disease when the host plant is under stress, species that develop latent infections and only fruit after the senescence of host tissue or ripening of host fruit, and endophytic species that sporulate only following host tissue death. The combination of these distinct life strategies, the fact that several Colletotrichum species may establish on a single host, and the ability of most of these species to also establish on a range of other hosts contribute significantly to the confusion surrounding species limits within Colletotrichum.",

            "In the early 1980s, when anthracnose became a major disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States, the USDA-ARS initiated a breeding program aimed at developing anthracnose-resistant cultivars suitable for the region. This program was established at the Small Fruit Research Station in Poplarville, MS, and the Fruit Laboratory in Beltsville, MD, in collaboration with state experiment stations in Florida, Louisiana, and North Carolina (Galletta et al., 1997; Smith and Spiers, 1982). From 1976 to 1995, over 160,000 progeny from 448 crosses made primarily by G.J. Galletta at Beltsville were screened for anthracnose resistance in the greenhouse at Poplarville, MS.",

            "A solid understanding of host-pathogen interactions is crucial for designing an effective breeding program for disease resistance. This approach is the more cost-effective option for controlling anthracnose in strawberries. Genetic components of resistance to both pathogenicity groups must be integrated to develop a broadly effective resistance, as the dominant resistant gene can be overcome by C. acutatum isolates from pathogenicity group 1 (7). A selection scheme was proposed for breeders, in which the likely quantitative resistance to C. acutatum from pathogenicity group 1 is selected in seedlings at the beginning of the selection process. Later, resistance to pathogenicity group 2, conferred by the dominant gene, is selected after vegetative multiplication of cold-stored plants. Research focused on molecular markers linked to these different resistance components would enhance our understanding of resistance and assist in selecting genitors for anthracnose resistance.",
            "The evaluation of strawberry seedlings and advanced breeding lines from state and private breeding programs continues as an ongoing project. The USDA\u2019s anthracnose-resistance screening procedure has effectively identified resistant genotypes in seedling progenies from the North Carolina State University breeding program, with over 32,000 resistant strawberry seedlings identified between 1998 and 1999 (Ballington et al., 2002).",

Additionally, cultivars with relative resistance may be crossed with commercial cultivars in breeding programs to improve and develop resistant varieties. To the best of our knowledge, this study represents the first attempt to evaluate the reaction of certain commercial strawberry cultivars against Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes strawberry AFR.",

Since then, two other significant red stele-resistant cultivars, \u2018Hood\u2019 and \u2018Benton\u2019, have emerged from the cooperative USDA-Oregon State strawberry breeding program. Furthermore, the first day-neutral cultivars with multiple resistances to red stele, \u2018Tristar\u2019 and \u2018Tribute\u2019, were released from Beltsville in 1981 (Galletta et al., 1981).",
            "Ongoing evaluation of strawberry seedlings and advanced breeding lines from state and private breeding programs continues. The USDA's anthracnose-resistance screening procedure has effectively identified resistant genotypes in seedling progenies from the North Carolina State University breeding program, with over 32,000 resistant strawberry seedlings identified between 1998 and 1999 (Ballington et al., 2002).",
            "The USDA-ARS program resulted in over 1,500 anthracnose-resistant selections from seedlings field-tested in Mississippi. Four of these selections were released as breeding lines (Galletta et al., 1993), and one was released as the cultivar Pelican, which is highly resistant to anthracnose crown rot caused by Colletotrichum fragariae and to anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum (Smith et al., 1998). Pelican is also resistant to five races of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae. Other selections have been utilized as parent lines in various breeding programs. To enhance genetic diversity in strawberry germplasm used in breeding, anthracnose-resistant clones have been identified in native plant collections and are being incorporated as parent lines (Lewers et al., 2007).",
            "To address this challenge, it is urgent to investigate the temperature adaptation of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries, particularly the prevalent ones like C. siamense and C. fructicola, focusing on their life cycles and pathogenesis. For effective control of anthracnose crown rot, developing disease-resistant strawberry varieties is essential. Resistance to crown anthracnose rot, combined with enhanced tolerance to high temperatures, should be a primary objective for strawberry breeders. Under global warming, significant latitudinal range shifts of plant pathogens have been observed, indicating that migration, rather than in situ adaptation to new climates, is the dominant response of pathogen populations to changing climates. Frequent host jumps and transitions facilitate the emergence of new fungal pathogens (Bebber et al. 2013; Chaloner et al. 2020). The evolution and flexibility of both temperature responses and host ranges among destructive Colletotrichum spp. contribute to their spread, invasion, and threat to strawberry production. Therefore, ongoing attention should be paid to changes in the biodiversity of fungal causal agents and their host ranges."

Latitude and elevation may play roles in influencing temperature variations, which in turn affect the geographic distribution of the Colletotrichum pathogens (Han et al. 2016). The host ranges of C. siamense and C. fructicola, the two most prevalent causal agents of strawberry crown rot, indicate that the vast majority of Colletotrichum fungi are not host-specific but can adapt to a wide range of hosts. This adaptability presents significant challenges in managing Colletotrichum species and mitigating their destructive effects in agricultural production. A comparative analysis of host ranges can partially reflect the prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields.",

In the literature, C. siamense has been most frequently reported in tropical and subtropical regions, while C. boninense, C. fructicola, and C. karstii have been documented across a wide range of latitudes. Temperature is a key environmental factor affecting a pathogen's survival. A recent study based on published observations of 612 crop pests and pathogens from 1960 onward revealed significant positive latitudinal shifts of many important pests and pathogens under climate change. More research on the genetic and biological characteristics of different Colletotrichum species from diverse geographical areas is necessary to understand the emergence and spread of anthracnose diseases. With rising global temperatures, it will be particularly important to monitor the expansion of the heat-adapted C. siamense toward higher latitudes.",

            "Colletotrichum species are economically important plant pathogens, particularly in tropical, subtropical, and temperate regions, where they affect a wide range of plant hosts (Sutton 1992). The typical symptoms of Colletotrichum infections include sunken necrotic lesions, often bearing orange conidial masses, referred to as anthracnose (Freeman et al. 1998). The impact of these pathogens on fruit crops is significant, causing severe yield losses; for example, bitter rot is one of the most critical diseases affecting apple fruit, potentially leading to yield losses of up to 50% (Sutton 1990).",
            "Observed changes in pest distributions align with observations of wild species, the direct responses of pests to warming, and expectations for expanding pest ranges under climate change. Although recent climate change is considered a significant driver of these observations, other factors may influence the results. New crop varieties and agricultural technologies have extended the agricultural margin northward in the USA, while deforestation has increased production in tropical regions, creating new opportunities for pest invasions at both high and low latitudes. Correlations between land use change and climate change can obscure analyses based on species' temperature ranges. Range expansions may be biased in one direction if equatorial barriers, such as the Sahara Desert, are more restrictive to pest movement than poleward barriers like permafrost. However, randomization tests have shown that no latitudinal shift would be expected in the absence of a directional temporal trend. Although factors like land use change do affect species distributions, the impact of such confounding factors diminishes in large-scale studies, making it unlikely to detect climate signals in noisy data without real climate drivers.",

This research is also crucial for predicting changes that may occur under global warming conditions. Further studies should be conducted on the host range, distribution, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species at different temperatures.",

            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",
            "The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",
            "Black root rot is a complex root disease of strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duchesne) that causes root death and reduces plant vigor, productivity, and winter hardiness. Certain rapidly growing gram-negative rod bacteria have also been implicated in strawberry black root rot.",
            "Anthracnose crown rot has been a destructive disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern U.S. since the 1930s. The causal fungus, Colletotrichum fragariae, infects all above-ground parts of the plant; however, the disease is most severe when it infects the crown, leading to crown rot, wilting, and plant death. Additionally, Colletotrichum gloeosporioides has been a problem since the late 1970s, while the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen, Colletotrichum acutatum, was first reported in the U.S. in 1986. Scientific investigations of anthracnose have focused on its epidemiology, the differences among the three causal Colletotrichum species, their infection processes, and pathogenicity. Findings from these studies have significantly improved control measures for this disease.",
            "C. acutatum causing strawberry anthracnose is predominantly a pathogen of fruit, stolons, and crowns. However, as demonstrated in this work, under appropriate environmental, agrotechnical, and epidemiological conditions, the pathogen can cause severe stunting and mortality of plants by infecting the root system.",
            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

            "In the southeastern United States, anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot can be particularly severe in strawberry production fields, especially during wet harvest seasons, which can lead to total crop loss. Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity."

While most studies have focused on comparisons of distantly related lineages, they also highlight the necessity for higher resolution taxonomic sampling to better understand the evolution of fungal genomes and their possible associations with phenotypic traits such as host range, pathogenic lifestyle, and reproductive strategy. In this context, the C. acutatum species complex serves as an excellent model system, offering a variety of closely related evolutionary lineages with different phenotypic characteristics. An example of this is the switch between mono- and dicotyledonous hosts that occurred in clade 5 (Figure 1). Comparative genomics and transcriptomics of late-diverging species adapted to different hosts may enhance our understanding of the genomic bases involved in host switching. Another notable case is the host specialization of certain lineages, such as C. lupini.

            "Morphological studies: There is a need to standardize incubation parameters for Colletotrichum species, as comparing the morphology of species grown under different conditions can be challenging or impossible. For inoculation, it is suggested to aseptically punch and transfer a mycelial disc (about 4 mm in diameter) from the actively growing edge of a 5-day-old single conidium-derived culture onto PDA. Cultures should be incubated at 20\u00b0C, 25\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C under constant fluorescent light. We do not recommend Sutton\u2019s protocol, as the alternating cycles of ultraviolet irradiation and darkness are not always practical and may introduce additional factors affecting fungal growth. Three replicate cultures of each isolate should be examined. After 7 days, conidial size and shape from more than 25 conidia should be measured and recorded, and colony characteristics can be documented and photographed (Than et al., 2008a). Observations and measurements (e.g., conidial size, appressoria size, and conidiogenous cells) should be conducted in water mounts. Appressoria can be produced using a slide culture technique, in which 10 mm\u00b2 plugs of PDA are placed in an empty Petri dish. The edge of the agar is inoculated with spores from a sporulating culture, and a sterile cover slip is placed over the inoculated agar (Johnston and Jones, 1997). After 7 days, the shape and size of the appressoria formed on the underside of the cover slip can be recorded.",

(2012) and Damm et al. (2012). Cultures were grown on Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA) and 1/4-strength PDA for 2 to 3 weeks at 25\u00b0C and 30\u00b0C under a 12-h light/12-h dark photoperiod. Our preliminary tests indicated that compared to PDA, the low-nutrient medium (1/4 PDA) could stimulate sporulation without affecting the size and shape of conidia. The experiment was performed in two independent trials, each consisting of two to three plates per isolate. Conidiomata were investigated using a dissecting microscope (Leica M125), while conidia, conidiophores, setae, asci, ascomata, and appressoria were examined using a light microscope (Leica DM2500). To induce appressorium formation, 20-30 \u00b5l of conidial suspension (prepared with sterile dH2O) was placed on a microscope slide, covered with a cover slip, and incubated in a moist chamber at 25\u00b0C for 2 to 3 days.

Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966).

            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

Most fruit infections occur within a 25-cm radius of the inoculum source, typically an infected fruit (Madden and Wilson, 1997).",

In this study, we assessed the development of anthracnose fruit rot from a point source of inoculum in strawberry plots planted at various densities over two seasons. A generalized linear statistical model, incorporating the spatial and plant density treatment aspects of the epidemic, was employed to quantify disease incidence.",

For the epidemiological theory proposed by Anderson and May to be fully applicable, there must be enough generations (within a single season or over several years, depending on the pathosystem) for the disease to reach equilibrium or asymptotic intensity. This necessitates time for multiple generations of plant-to-plant (or fruit-to-fruit) spread. However, many economically significant diseases are monocyclic, at least within a single year, and it remains unclear from the limited empirical evidence available how plant density influences these circumstances. Increasing plant density will heighten the likelihood of a propagule coming into contact with a plant unit adjacent to the source of the propagules.

            "Anthracnose is a major disease of strawberry (Fragaria ananassa Duch.) in California nursery and fruit production (Gunnell and Gubler 1992; Smith 1998), an industry that represents 83% of fresh market fruit production in the United States and is estimated to have a value of over $1.8 billion annually (CDFA 2015-2016). All parts of the plant are susceptible to infection, resulting in significant yield loss from the various phases of the disease, including crown rot, root rot, flower blight, fruit rot (i.e., black spot), petiole lesions, and leaf spots (Daugovish et al. 2009; Howard et al. 1992; Smith 2008). Members of the fungal genus Colletotrichum are associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide, with Colletotrichum gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. and occasionally C. fragariae A. N. Brooks most commonly causing crown rot and root rot, while C. acutatum J. H. Simmonds is most commonly responsible for foliar and fruit rot (Freeman and Rodriguez 1995; Howard et al. 1992; Smith and Black 1990). In California, however, C. acutatum is the most common causal agent for all above- and below-ground phases of the disease (Daugovish et al. 2009; Koike et al. 2008). More recently, C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum have been considered to be species complexes (Damm et al. 2012; Weir et al. 2012).",
            "Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.",
            "All isolates from different parts of diseased strawberry plants (roots, vegetative parts, and fruits) produced masses of salmon-orange acute conidia (average size 15 \u00d7 4 \u00b5m) in dense white mycelium. This morphology is characteristic of C. acutatum grown on supplemented MS or Potato Dextrose Agar (PDA).",
            "On inoculated strawberry plants, isolates of C. fructicola and C. murrayae exhibited strong pathogenicity, affecting both leaves and petioles, with plant mortality observed 30 days post-inoculation. Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997). Infected transplants can spread the disease from the nursery to the field, where typical symptoms of anthracnose manifest as irregular black leaf spots, crown rot, flower blight, and fruit rot (Howard et al. 1992).",

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",

            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.",

Such mother plants are considered the primary inoculum source from which the fungus proliferates and then spreads to daughter plants in the nursery, eventually reaching production fields via transplants. While plant infection in the nursery is a significant source of inoculum, there may be additional sources for the dissemination of the fungus and initiation of new epidemics, such as other plant species. Strawberry is cultivated alongside tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetable crops, with various weeds persisting in the vicinity of nurseries and near or within strawberry production fields in Israel.

Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum. Strawberry anthracnose diseases have been reported to be caused by C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (the teleomorph of Cromereilla cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), and C. dematium (Pers.) Grove. The latter species only occasionally causes strawberry fruit rots and will not be discussed here.",
            "The fungi Colletotrichum fragariae and Colletotrichum acutatum cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. C. fragariae was originally assumed to be the sole causal agent of strawberry anthracnose in the United States until 1986, when Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberries in the U.S. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot in Queensland, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however, it may have been present in the U.S. for some time under the name Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984).",
            "Anthracnose is a key limiting factor for strawberry production in Taiwan and many other regions. Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species."

Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries.

            "Statistics: Analysis of variance (ANOVA) was performed using the general linear models procedure (PROC GLM, SAS Institute, Cary, N.C.). Estimates of general and specific combining ability were determined using standard methodology for analyzing data from diallel crosses (Griffing, 1956). Method 4, model I (fixed) based on F1s, and Method 2, model I (fixed), based on parents and F1s (half diallel), were used for the analysis of the main and secondary tests, respectively. These methods and models for combining ability analysis were selected because of the characteristics of the experiments in this study (i.e., a reduced number of parents were used without reciprocal crosses). When a limited number of parents are evaluated (<10) and the selection of these parents cannot be considered random, then a fixed model is recommended (Baker, 1978; Christie and Shattuck, 1992). Griffing\u2019s analysis of combining ability requires no special genetic assumptions beyond those necessary for the ANOVA and has been used to convey reliable information on the combining potential of parents (Baker, 1978; Christie and Shattuck, 1992). Baker (1978) concluded that diallel analyses should be used only to estimate combining ability, and attempting to interpret diallel statistics in terms of components of genetic variance is subject to failure in either of both assumptions of independent distribution of genes in the parent and absence of epistasis, unless parents have been produced by a process of random mating and non-selective inbreeding.",

We advocate for epitypification and the use of multi-locus phylogenetic methods to better delimit species and understand the genus.",
            "Disentangling species complexes within the Colletotrichum genus presents a significant challenge for taxonomists. Given the global importance of this genus, primarily consisting of plant pathogens, it is critical to accurately identify species and/or pathotypes to enhance biosecurity and disease control efforts. Traditional methods of species identification have relied on morphological, cultural, and host-preference criteria. However, these methods often prove unreliable, leading to unresolved taxonomic issues. As stated by Sutton (1992), relying solely on morphology is insufficient for improving the systematics of species complexes like C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Identification and characterization of Colletotrichum species typically rely on morphological characteristics (Hyde et al. 2009; Photita et al. 2005), including conidial morphology, production of perithecia (Freeman et al. 2000), and sensitivity to benomyl (Valero et al. 2010). However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.",
            "Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998). Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).",
            "Traditional methods for distinguishing between species of Colletotrichum have primarily relied on morphological traits, such as the size and shape of conidia, colony color, presence or absence of setae, and the existence of the teleomorph, Glomerella cingulata. However, environmental influences on the stability of morphological traits and the existence of intermediate forms mean these criteria are not always sufficient for the reliable differentiation of the Colletotrichum species responsible for strawberry anthracnose. Recently, various molecular techniques have been employed to accurately identify the three main species causing strawberry anthracnose. Polymerase chain reaction (PCR), utilizing primers of repeat motifs, is a rapid and reliable method for differentiating between members of the Colletotrichum complex. Studies of vegetative compatibility offer another approach to determining genetic relatedness in anamorphic populations of plant pathogens, including Fusarium oxysporum and Colletotrichum species. Since the exchange of genetic material requires hyphal anastomosis, vegetatively compatible isolates are expected to be more similar to one another, thus forming a distinct genetic population.",
            "Identification within the genus Colletotrichum is complicated, as species exhibit few distinguishing morphological characters, and teleomorphic stages are rarely formed (Hyde et al., 2009). Some taxa have uncertain or extensive host relationships and pathological variations, and they are often morphologically variable in culture (Simmonds, 1965; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008).

(1997) concluded that taxonomic uncertainty complicates accurate identification, hindering efforts to understand host relationships, diagnose diseases, develop effective control strategies, and establish cost-effective quarantine programs.",
            "The species accepted in the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex form a strongly supported clade in the Colletotrichum ITS gene tree (Fig. 1 in Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). All species are micro-morphologically typical of C. gloeosporioides sensu von Arx (1970) and Sutton (1992). However, morphology alone cannot unequivocally place an isolate in this complex, making the ITS region particularly important for identification at the species complex level in Colletotrichum. For example, members of the C. boninense species complex (Damm et al. 2012b, this issue) and C. cliviae (Yang et al. 2009) are micro-morphologically similar to species in the C. gloeosporioides complex but are genetically distinct (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue). The utility of ITS sequences is enhanced by their strong representation in GenBank, but this can also lead to issues. Nilsson et al. (2006) summarized the frequency of inaccurately annotated data in GenBank. The diversity of taxonomic concepts surrounding the name C. gloeosporioides exacerbates this issue. This is illustrated by the phylogeny presented by Hyde et al. (2010), based on GenBank accessions of ITS sequences identified as C. gloeosporioides and Glomerella cingulata, showing that the taxa represented belong to many species in different Colletotrichum species complexes. Specific examples of misidentified GenBank accessions can be found in the notes under C. boehmeriae, C. crassipes, and C. kahawae subsp. kahawae.",
            "In the past, common identification systems for Colletotrichum included traditional morphological taxonomy, molecular classification based on ITS sequences, and the presence of secondary metabolites, among other traits. However, these methods alone or in combination were insufficient to fully resolve the species identity of individual Colletotrichum isolates. Additional characteristics, including other aspects of morphology and multi-gene phylogenetic analyses, are necessary for accurate identification of Colletotrichum species.",
            "The main objective of this study was to identify and characterize the Colletotrichum species associated with anthracnose of Amaryllidaceae in southwest China and Chiang Rai, Thailand, based on morphological characters and DNA sequence data. A taxonomic strategy for studying Colletotrichum species has been reviewed by Cai et al. (2009), which suggests a polyphasic approach since a single phenotypic character has proven inadequate for differentiating Colletotrichum species. It was emphasized that multiple-loci phylogeny should be employed as the basis for establishing species relationships. In this study, twenty strains of Colletotrichum were separated into six morpho-types using morphological characters, while ITS sequence data (Fig. 1) delineated eight phylogenetic lineages, although support for two clades was low. Combined multi-gene datasets (Fig. 2) delineated eight well-supported distinct phylogenetic lineages (bootstrap > 95%) representing distinct taxa, meeting the standard required for the rank of phylogenetic species (Taylor et al., 2000). Four of the species had type or epitype data in GenBank, which was used for comparison. Three species are described as new species, each uniquely characterized by the...",
            "The taxonomy of Colletotrichum is currently unsatisfactory, highlighting the pressing need for a polyphasic approach to identification that accurately reflects the natural classification of species and subspecific taxa within the genus (Sutton, 1992; Cannon et al., 2000). This paper proposes a taxonomic framework for describing Colletotrichum epitypes and new species. This framework utilizes a multi-gene phylogeny based on type specimens, along with well-defined phylogenetic lineages that correlate with recognizable polyphasic characters such as morphology, cultural characteristics, physiology, and pathogenicity. The paper discusses various approaches that have been used or could be incorporated in the study of Colletotrichum species, including recommended methodologies and a discussion on the correlation of characters with phylogenetic types. A phylogenetic analysis based on the internal transcribed spacers and the 5.8S ribosomal RNA gene (ITS) from specimens, including 42 ex-type strains, is also provided (Fig. 1)."

            "The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).",
            "Despite intensive research that has contributed to the understanding of the Colletotrichum genus pathogenic to strawberries, there is still a lack of an accurate inventory of these causal agents. The population and prevalence of strawberry-virulent Colletotrichum species have not been systematically investigated in major producers such as China. To address these gaps, this review aims to summarize the biodiversity of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries by examining the global discovery history. Subsequently, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries in China was analyzed using available data. Finally, we categorized the host range of the two predominant species responsible for strawberry crown rot. This knowledge has important applications for biosecurity risk management (e.g., proper risk estimation in strawberry seedling trade), accurate diagnosis, and anthracnose control. It further lays the groundwork for systematically managing Colletotrichum genera in agricultural ecosystems, not only for the strawberry industry.",
            "Through multilocus sequence analysis coupled with morphological characterization, recent studies have identified many additional Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry, namely C. acutatum, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii (C. acutatum species complex), as well as C. aenigma, C. changpingense, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. siamense, and C. theobromicola (syn. C. fragariae) (C. gloeosporioides species complex), and C. boninense (C. boninense species complex). Although strawberry is of great economic importance in Taiwan and anthracnose has become more destructive in the past decade, the pathogen population in Taiwan has not been systematically investigated. The causal agents of strawberry anthracnose were previously reported to include C. gloeosporioides, C. dematium, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum, but information about the isolation, pathogenicity, morphology, and genetic sequences of these species is insufficient for accurate species identification. Recently, based on the analysis of multiple gene sequences, we identified C. siamense as the pathogen causing anthracnose crown rot.",
            "From a historical perspective, identifying the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose has faced considerable confusion at the species level for a long time. This process has gradually evolved from coarse estimates to precise identifications, as noted by Ji et al. in Phytopathology Research (2022). The first report of strawberry infection by C. fragariae occurred over 90 years ago in the southeastern USA (Brooks 1931). Morphological observations make it difficult to distinguish C. fragariae from C. gloeosporioides, the latter of which was described in the nineteenth century for a pathogen isolated from citrus in Italy (Penzig 1882). Consequently, early-stage strawberry anthracnose was often attributed to either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides.",
            "Abstract: Colletotrichum fungi belonging to the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides species complex include several economically significant postharvest pathogens that often cause anthracnose. Previously, different species in this group could only be reliably distinguished using multigenic phylogenetic analyses. Using a comparative genomics approach, we developed a marker to differentiate Colletotrichum fructicola, Colletotrichum aenigma, and Colletotrichum siamense within the C. gloeosporioides species complex based on PCR amplicon size differences. When we used this marker to classify 115 isolates collected over 20 years from strawberries in Chiba Prefecture, Japan, the isolates were predominantly C. fructicola. To our knowledge, this is the first report characterizing different species of Colletotrichum infecting strawberries in Japan and contributes to our understanding of the diversity of anthracnose pathogens in the country.",
            "Identification results were problematic (Than et al. 2008; Weir et al. 2012; Yang et al. 2009). Proper identification of the pathogen is the basis for developing effective management strategies. Therefore, it is very important to accurately distinguish between the species. In this paper, we confirm that Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu stricto (s.s.) is one of the species of the genus Colletotrichum responsible for walnut anthracnose in China.",

PHI test results (\u03a6w) < 0.05 indicate significant recombination within the dataset. Previous studies on Colletotrichum species causing strawberry anthracnose were mainly based on morphological characters and single-gene identifications, which often led to identification at the species complex level rather than individual species (Ye et al. 2009). Due to the high variability in morphological characters (Sutton 1992, Johnston & Jones 1997), differentiation between two main strawberry pathogens, C. gloeosporioides and C. theobromicola (fragariae), became problematic (Ye et al. 1997, Xie et al. 2010). This challenge prompted the use of molecular methods (Cai et al. 2009), which provide valuable data for clarifying the systematics of Colletotrichum (Hyde et al. 2014, Yan et al. 2015). Xie et al. (2010) identified the Colletotrichum species causing anthracnose disease of strawberry cultivar Toyonoka in Zhejiang and Shanghai, China, to be C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. theobromicola using morphology and the ITS gene region alone. As the ITS gene alone does not effectively resolve Colletotrichum species (Martinez-Culebras 2002, Jelev et al. 2008, Xie et al. 2010), multigene analysis has been adopted to satisfactorily resolve Colletotrichum species (Cai et al. 2009, Hyde et al. 2014), and the present study has followed this protocol.",

            "The first symptoms of flower blight in this experiment were observed at 23 DAI, when a significantly lower percentage of blighted flowers was found in the plots treated with grass mulch (Figure 3a, P < 0.05). No effects of genetic resistance or interactions between mulching material and cultivar were detected at this point in the epidemics. By 29 DAI, the incidence of blighted flowers in the plots treated with plastic mulch was greater than in the plots with grass mulch.",
            "Several studies (e.g., 720 et al. 1990a, 1990b, 1992; Madden et al. 1992, 1993; Ntahimpera et al. 1998) have noted a significant reduction in the incidence of flower blight in treatments using grass mulch compared to plastic mulch, particularly with natural or simulated precipitation. These effects are observed under common irrigation practices in Brazil. The most likely explanation for this reduction is the decreased dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia, which relies heavily on water splash. While no spatial pattern analyses were conducted, the observed decrease in disease levels with increasing distance from the inoculum source in grass-mulched plots suggests reduced pathogen dispersal in these areas.",
            "At the later stages of the epidemics (55 DAI), the interaction between irrigation systems and mulching material became significant (P < 0.01): for overhead-irrigated plots, the use of plastic mulch increased the incidence of flower blight more than threefold, while no significant effect of mulching material was observed for the drip-irrigated or plastic tape-irrigated plots (Figure 1b). No significant interactions between irrigation and mulching materials were found for the area under the disease progress curves (AUDPCs) of the incidence of blighted flowers. The average AUDPC values for drip, plastic tape, and overhead irrigation were significantly different (P < 0.01), while AUDPCs between plastic and grass mulch were similar (P > 0.05, Table 1).",
            "The single and combined effects of mulching materials and partial host resistance on the incidence of flower blight were studied under overhead sprinkler irrigation conditions. Three mulching materials were compared: (a) 0.03-mm black, non-permeable polyethylene plastic, (b) sun-dried grass mulch (Brachiaria sp.), and (c) sun-dried pine mulch (Pinus elliottii) collected from a nearby reforestation area to a depth of approximately 4 cm. The mulches were applied to the plots 25 days after transplanting (DAT).",
            "Localized low-pressure overhead tape irrigation was applied 20 days after inoculation (DAI) (Figure 1a). Disease occurrence in the drip-irrigated treatment was only observed very late in the season at 47 DAI, albeit at a low incidence of 0.2%. In the early stages of the epidemics (20 DAI), the interaction between irrigation systems and mulching materials was significant (P < 0.05), indicating that the effects of the mulches were influenced by the irrigation system used. The highest incidence of flower blight was found in the combination of overhead irrigation and plastic mulch (Figure 1a). Later in the epidemics (27\u201347 DAI, not shown), significant interactions between irrigation and mulching materials were no longer observed (P > 0.05). The lack of significant interactions between the main factors allowed for separate comparisons of the irrigation systems and mulch types (Figure 2). Disease levels were lower in low-pressure tape-irrigated plots than in those irrigated by overhead sprinklers, regardless of the mulch material applied (Figure 2a, Table 1). Similarly, disease levels in plots covered with grass mulch were lower than in those using plastic mulch (Figure 2b).",
            "In Figure 3, the single main effects of mulch type on flower blight incidence are illustrated for 23 DAI (above) and 29 DAI (below). No significant interactions between mulching material and cultivar genotype were detected at these times during the epidemics. Differences among cultivars remained significant later in the epidemics at 37 and 44 DAI (P < 0.01), although the effect of mulching material ceased to be significant (P > 0.05). Lower percentages of blighted flowers were observed on cultivar Dover (always below 15%), while disease incidence on cultivar Campinas ranged between 45% and 50%.",
            "Figure 4 presents disease progress curves for the single main effects of mulching material and partial genetic resistance on flower blight incidence. The main effects of mulching material are shown above, and the effects of cultivar genotype are depicted below. No significant interactions were observed for the AUDPCs between mulching material and genotype (P < 0.01). Cultivar Campinas had disease units more than three times higher than those of Dover. Although the shape of the disease progress curves suggested a more rapid disease progression in plastic mulched plots, AUDPC values for mulch treatments were similar (P > 0.05).",

            "Seven species of Colletotrichum known to cause ripe fruit rots in Queensland are compared regarding spore measurements, cultural characteristics, temperature reactions, and host range, determined by field collection and artificial inoculation. The characteristic features of these organisms are discussed, and it is concluded that it is necessary to designate a new form of C. gloeosporioides and one new species. Ripe fruit rots are a common source of loss in Queensland, particularly in tropical and subtropical fruits. Among the pathogens associated, species of the genus Colletotrichum are by far the most prevalent. Members of this group are particularly suited to this type of activity, and their ability to maintain a saprophytic existence on decaying host parts ensures a reliable source of inoculum. Additionally, by forming latent infections throughout the fruit's growing period, the parasite becomes largely independent of environmental conditions during ripening, not to mention the protection it gains from fungicides. Several distinct species of Colletotrichum are associated with ripe fruit rots in Queensland, and multiple species may be responsible for similar diseases on a single fruit variety. This paper attempts to categorize these species correctly while summarizing their main characteristics. It is hoped that the information presented will aid future determinations and enhance the understanding of the importance of individual diseases.",
            "Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has been reported as a common anthracnose pathogen in several guava-growing countries [74, 75, 77, 83]. In Hawaii, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been noted to infect guava leaves [76]. Intan Sakinah et al. (2014) [78] identified C. gloeosporioides sensu lato as the most prevalent species causing anthracnose in guava fruit, while suggesting that other species within the C. gloeosporioides complex may also be implicated in guava anthracnose. Additionally, Colletotrichum acutatum has been reported to cause anthracnose disease in guava [134\u2013136]. More recent multiple gene phylogeny studies aimed at identifying Colletotrichum species indicate that several species from the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum complexes are associated with guava anthracnose. The C. acutatum complex includes C. simmondsii in Brazil [79], C. abscissum in Brazil and the USA [80, 82], and C. guajavae in India [12]. Among the species in the C. gloeosporioides complex associated with guava, C. psidii was detected in Italy [13], and C. siamense was found in India [81]. In a pathogenicity study by Bragan\u00e7a et al. (2016) [82], C. nymphaeae, isolated from apple fruits in Brazil, was shown to cause lesions on guava fruits, highlighting the cross-pathogenicity of this species.",
            "Dragon fruit anthracnose, caused by Colletotrichum, affects the stems and fruits of Hylocereus spp. Earlier studies report C. gloeosporioides sensu lato as the most common anthracnose pathogen in Hylocereus megalanthus in Brazil; H. undatus is noted as prevalent in Okinawa Prefecture, Japan, and in Miami-Dade County, Florida, USA. Colletotrichum gloeosporioides sensu lato has also been identified as an anthracnose-causing pathogen affecting the stems and fruits of H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and Selenicereus megalanthus in Malaysia. Using only ITS sequences, Lin et al. (2017) identified three species\u2014C. gloeosporioides, C. truncatum, and C. boninense\u2014as anthracnose agents in H. polyrhizus, H. undatus, and H. costaricensis plants growing in several counties. After applying multiple markers for the identification of Colletotrichum species, several members within the C. gloeosporioides complex have been reported as anthracnose pathogens in Hylocereus spp. Ma et al. (2014) reported C. gloeosporioides as an anthracnose pathogen in the young stems of H. undatus in China. In a later study, Zhao et al. (2018) found C. siamense to be the causative agent of stem anthracnose in H. polyrhizus in China. Additionally, C. aenigma and C. siamense have been reported to be associated with stem and fruit anthracnose in H. undatus grown in Pathum Thani, Nakhon Pathom, and Samut Sakhon, Thailand. Colletotrichum siamense is also responsible for fruit anthracnose in H. undatus growing in the Andaman Islands, India. In Brazil, C. karstii was reported as the causal pathogen of stem anthracnose in H. undatus. In addition to species within the C. gloeosporioides complex, C. truncatum is also reported as an anthracnose pathogen in Hylocereus spp. Colletotrichum truncatum is the causative agent of stem anthracnose in H. polyrhizus in Malaysia, and H. undatus was also reported in fruits sold in a market in Yuanjiang County, Yunnan Province, China. Seven Colletotrichum species were identified as causal anthracnose pathogens of different types of dragon fruits. However, information on anthracnose pathogens associated with fruits and stems in major producing countries, including Vietnam, Indonesia, and Sri Lanka, is still lacking."

            "For controlling walnut anthracnose, the primary management strategy relies on the timely application of fungicides. In this paper, we determined the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. isolates to various fungicides, including difenoconazole, tebuconazole, flusilazole, and carbendazim. Although the number of isolates was relatively limited, the results indicated differences in resistance ratios to carbendazim and tebuconazole among all isolates. The resistance ratios to carbendazim ranged from 1 to 87.3, while those for tebuconazole ranged from 1 to 51.6. Isolates SL-31, SL-34, SL-30, and SL-37, collected from Shangluo County, Shaanxi Province, showed resistance ratios to tebuconazole of 1, 6, 16.2, and 38.9, respectively. Carbendazim and tebuconazole are extensively used to control walnut anthracnose disease, and the observed differences in sensitivities may reflect the local frequency of fungicide usage. Additionally, the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum to carbendazim differed (Cao et al. 2017). Our study indicated that isolates of C. gloeosporioides s.s. exhibited varying sensitivities to carbendazim. These results reflect the sensitivities of C. gloeosporioides s.s. causing walnut anthracnose to fungicides to some extent. To enhance control effectiveness, it is essential for practitioners to ascertain the sensitivities of isolates to fungicides. Based on the EC50 values and resistance ratios, difenoconazole and flusilazole are expected to provide better control than carbendazim and tebuconazole in a given plantation. However, these efficacies need to be validated with more field trials in the future. For effective control of walnut anthracnose, accurate identification of the pathogen is crucial. It is also necessary to determine the fungicide sensitivities of different isolates within the same fungal taxon. Fungicides should be chosen cautiously for disease management, and those with different mechanisms should be used in rotation.",

            "Colletotrichum spp. infect many other hosts, so it is sometimes assumed that the primary infection in strawberry fields comes from infected plants of these hosts growing nearby. To test the hypothesis that Colletotrichum spp. may move from other fruit or vegetable crops to strawberries, Smith (2002) wound-inoculated the leaves and stems of strawberry, blueberry, blackberry, muscadine grape, tomato, and pepper with 37 Colletotrichum isolates, representing nine species collected from 12 hosts. Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate. These results suggest that primary anthracnose infections in strawberry production fields most often arise from infected strawberry transplants and only rarely from anthracnose-infected fruit or vegetable crops adjacent to the strawberry fields. However, C. acutatum and C. gloeosporioides have both been shown to move from infected host plants near the fields to strawberry production fields (Freeman et al., 2000b).",

Four within-row plant densities were established in replicated plots over two years. A generalized linear model with a logit link function and binomial distribution for incidence was used to quantify the effects of distance from the spore source, side of the row relative to the inoculum source, plant density treatment, and their interactions on disease incidence.",

These effects are observed under common irrigation practices in Brazil. The most likely explanation for this reduction is the decreased dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia, which relies heavily on water splash. While no spatial pattern analyses were conducted, the observed decrease in disease levels with increasing distance from the inoculum source in grass-mulched plots suggests reduced pathogen dispersal in these areas.",

            "In inoculations conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions, C. acutatum from strawberry was isolated from inoculated plants that did not exhibit disease symptoms but maintained virulence on strawberry. The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods. Furthermore, it has been shown that C. acutatum from strawberry can survive for nine months within plant debris in soil.",

Molecular tools have effectively distinguished Colletotrichum species, clearly separating C. acutatum from C. gloeosporioides and identifying genetically distinct subgroups within C. acutatum. Nonetheless, the disease cycles of C. acutatum in many host-pathogen systems remain poorly understood, even in economically important crops. This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis. The tissue specificity and life cycles of C. acutatum are likely under genetic control, and it may be possible to induce mutants that are no longer pathogenic to certain hosts or tissues, thereby elucidating the genetic basis for tissue or host specificity, as seen in other Colletotrichum species.",

The only DNA sequences available for isolates identified as C. gossypii and C. gossypii var. cephalosporioides are ITS2 and the D2 region of the rDNA LSU, neither of which resolves their relationships within the C. gloeosporioides complex. Whether the seedling pathogen regarded by Silva-Mann et al. (2005) and Bailey et al. (1996) as C. gossypii represents the species first described from cotton in the USA is unknown.

Specifically, with a 20% drainage rate, leaf length and width increased by 14.1% and 19.7%, respectively, compared to the four-times timer-supplying method, and by 23.6% and 29.5% compared to the six-times timer-supplying method. A lower rhizosphere water content, caused by a reduced drainage rate, increases root water stress, thereby inhibiting nutrient absorption and reducing plant and leaf area [26]. Leaf area was lowest at 1173 mm\u00b2 in the treatment with four daily watering events and highest at 1586 mm\u00b2 in the 20% drainage rate treatment, though the difference was not statistically significant (data not shown)."

            "Based on field trials in Florida (Mertely et al., 2009), the recommendation for anthracnose control involves weekly applications of a broad-spectrum protectant fungicide (captan) at the lowest label rate early in the season when conditions are less favorable for anthracnose development. Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised. Tank mixes or higher rates of protectant fungicides should be maintained until the end of the harvest season or until dry weather effectively suppresses the disease.",
            "In addition to chemical treatments, heat treatment of transplants may reduce mortality from anthracnose, but this practice is not widely used due to its potential to reduce plant vigor (Freeman et al., 1997). In-season fungicide spray applications are common to prevent foliar and fruit infections (Koike et al., 2008; MacKenzie and Peres, 2012), but these are ineffective against crown rot and root necrosis (Daugovish et al., 2009).",

However, it may adversely affect plant vigor, especially for transplants meant for production fields. While this treatment could serve as an alternative to chemical fungicides, its long-term impacts on plant development and yield require further investigation.

Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance.

            "Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.",
            "C. siamense and C. fructicola are recognized as the primary pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose crown rot in the Asia-Pacific region (Nam et al. 2013; Han et al. 2016; Jayawardena et al. 2016a; Gan et al. 2017; Hirayama et al. 2018; Gupta et al. 2019; Chen et al. 2020; Chung et al. 2020; Zhang et al. 2020; Jian et al. 2021; Zhong et al. 2021; Oliveira et al. 2022; Wang et al. 2022). These two species are the most frequently occurring Colletotrichum species worldwide (Talhinhas and Baroncelli 2021). Both are cosmopolitan fungi that can adapt to a diverse array of host plants, with higher occurrences reported in tropical and subtropical regions, particularly in Asia compared to other continents.",
            "Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.",

These findings align with those reported by Karimi et al. (2017). From symptomatic plant tissues, eight Colletotrichum-like fungal isolates were obtained: six from fruit, one from crown, and one from leaf.

            "The pathogenicity assays conducted in this study were based on research from Belgium, given the similar molecular diversity of anthracnose pathogen populations associated with strawberry production. These assays, using isolates representing this molecular diversity, revealed variability in aggressiveness among different species within C. acutatum sensu lato, as well as complex patterns both between and within species. For example, isolates of C. fioriniae and C. nymphaeae originating from strawberries appeared equally aggressive, with C. nymphaeae showing a degree of host preference. Isolates of both C. fioriniae and C. godetiae included those from other hosts that exhibited comparable levels of aggressiveness to strawberry isolates. Similar patterns were noted with some non-strawberry isolates from species such as C. acutatum sensu stricto and C. simmondsii. Moreover, at least one isolate of C. godetiae from strawberries was significantly less aggressive than others. These observations suggest that certain Colletotrichum species, like C. fioriniae and C. godetiae, contain populations capable of infecting a broader range of hosts, which may be influenced by environmental conditions. Further studies, utilizing a more extensive set of isolates from these three species alongside appropriate pathological and biological assays, are essential for gaining deeper insights into the evolution of pathogenicity, field symptoms, and the differential responses to host varieties and fungicides used in UK strawberry production systems.",

On these plants, asymptomatic, quiescent infections occur on unripe fruit, developing into necrotic lesions as the fruit ripens (Alkan et al., 2015). There are many other examples of post-harvest decay in fruits like peaches (Prunus persica), almonds (Prunus dulcis), avocado (Persea americana), mango (Mangifera indica), papaya (Carica papaya), and guava (Psidium guajava) that stem from quiescent infections that began in the field (Agostini et al., 1992; Freeman and Shabi, 1996; Smith, 1998; Afanador-Kafuri et al., 2003).",

            "Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.",

            "Fruit Hemibiotrophic Lifestyle (Blueberry, Apple, Stone Fruit): Fruit decays represent a common lifestyle of C. acutatum, leading to diseases such as blueberry ripe rot, apple bitter rot, and anthracnose of peach, along with numerous anthracnose diseases in subtropical and tropical fruits. In cases like bitter rot of apple and ripe rot of blueberry, acervuli are produced abundantly on mature fruit. Conidia from these acervuli are splash-dispersed, germinate to form appressoria, and establish quiescent infections on fruit, as demonstrated in peaches. These diseases can occur both in the field and post-harvest. However, most quiescent infections develop throughout the growing season. For blueberries, C. acutatum is also known to attack young leaves and other tissues, although this is rare. Thus, conidia from acervuli on leaves and decaying fruit may serve as a source of inoculum for other fruits, and the pathogen can survive as appressoria in bud scales and dead fruiting twigs. In apples, the source of inoculum is less obvious, as C. acutatum only causes disease on fruit. The fungus appears to be widespread in orchards and is easily isolated from both healthy and damaged tissue. In Michigan, where bitter rot is rare, C. acutatum remains prevalent in apple orchards and is commonly isolated, suggesting that it survives and reproduces as an epiphyte or endophyte, akin to the epiphytic\u2013short necrotroph lifestyle.",
