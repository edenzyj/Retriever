Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

This approach should integrate molecular, morphological, physiological, and pathogenic data.', 0.6194214820861816]]\nContext 5: [['Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al.

Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).', 0.5870019197463989]]\nContext 7: [['Cano, J., Guarro, J., and Gene, J.

The roots of transplants are likely contaminated during digging, trimming, and packing operations in nurseries. Therefore, roots may not be infected when the crop is grown as a perennial. The management practices for strawberries influence the pathogen's cycle. Although strawberries are perennials, they are often treated as annuals in cultivation. Transplants are frequently produced far from commercial fields, necessitating the fungus to survive as symptomatic or quiescent infections on transplants that serve as inoculum for commercial fields. The biotrophic phase of the fungus is usually very short; however, infected leaves, petioles, and runners may not show symptoms for an extended period. Secondary conidiation can occur on the surfaces of vegetative tissues, increasing inoculum levels that can infect flowers and fruits. These conidia, formed on foliage without causing symptoms, are dispersed by splashing water and harvesting activities, transferring from foliage to flowers and fruits.

The former was not separated morphologically from C. acutatum, being designated primarily based on its pathogenicity to pines. C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum was distinguished based on pink and red pigments in the agar medium during culture.

The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic.

All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4\u00b0C as described by Perkins. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests.

However, other conidial shapes are frequently encountered, particularly cylindrical forms with only one acute end. These variations are often observed in strains that have been repeatedly subcultured, as well as in the \u201cterminal crook\u201d disease of pine (Dingley & Gilmour 1972) and in the anthracnose affecting leather leaf fern (Schiller et al. 2006). There are also reports of disseminated infections in sea turtles (Manire et al. 2002) and infections in scale insects (Marcelino et al. 2008). Differentiating between C. acutatum (s. lat.) and C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is challenging due to the existence of many intermediate strains that exhibit a limited number of typical fusiform conidia alongside numerous cylindrical ones (Van der Aa et al. 1990).', 0.6823064088821411]]\nContext 5: [['C. acutatum was first described as a separate species by Simmonds. Many isolates now identified as C. acutatum were either classified under C. gloeosporioides or considered species of Gloeo sporium. C. acutatum affects hosts that are also targeted by other Colletotrichum species, possibly leading to its earlier misidentification. For instance, strawberries can be affected by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae.

Cultures from certain hosts are highly chromogenic and excrete red and pink pigments into the culture media. The primary production of conidia occurs in acervuli; however, C. acutatum can also form secondary conidia on the surfaces of living leaves. Conidia are typically ellipsoid and fusiform at least at one end, differing from C. gloeosporioides, which generally has both ends rounded. Setae are usually sparse or not produced at all. Pigmented appressoria form upon germination of the conidia and vary in shape and size.', 0.5001078248023987]]\nContext 8: [['Considering the frequency with which strains from the C. acutatum species complex are encountered and their pathogenicity to a wide range of crop plants, it would be surprising if earlier names for C. acutatum did not exist. Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.', 0.48125511407852173]]\nContext 9: [['The general disease cycles of C. acutatum from different hosts often share common attributes. All produce acervuli with abundant conidia on one or more host tissues, and conidia are splash-dispersed, serving as the primary inoculum source for most infections. Conidia can survive in a gelatinous matrix if conditions are appropriate; however, they typically germinate to produce appressoria and quiescent infections. The tissues on which sporulation and reproduction occur differ among various hosts, and the fate of appressoria and quiescent infections varies greatly. As far as is known, the sexual stage plays only a minor role in the life cycle of C. acutatum. Although the pathogen exhibits overlapping survival strategies, the disease cycles of C. acutatum on different hosts can be grouped according to four general lifestyles.', 0.42640000581741333]]\n"

Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020). Currently, a total of 257 Colletotrichum species grouped into 15 complexes and 13 additional singletons have been accepted in this genus.', 0.4767742156982422]]\nContext 2: [['Various studies highlight the significance of Colletotrichum species in agriculture.

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].', 0.9918453097343445]]\nContext 1: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose.

Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished).

Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

Following reports of reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin in the field, high levels of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resistance were detected in California isolates of the pathogen. Resistance was associated with the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene, similar to a previous report from Florida, and there were no detected fitness penalties in pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, several alternative fungicides were investigated in laboratory and field studies. Subsequently, the new biofungicide natamycin was identified.

Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose.

The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants.

Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg\u00b7L\u20131).', 0.9742597341537476]]\nContext 1: [['Nitrogen is absorbed by plant roots in two forms: ammonium (NH4-N) and nitrate (NO3-N).

ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.', 0.99674391746521]]\nContext 1: [['Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.9941658973693848]]\nContext 2: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992).

The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9929847717285156]]\nContext 3: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel.

However, some practices, such as planting oats before wheat in rotation, have little apparent effect on nitrification but provide some of the most effective control of take-all (3.12, 22).

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot.

Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.566711962223053]]\nContext 3: [['Therefore, we aimed to examine the effects of irrigation systems, mulching materials, and genetically based resistance, as well as their interactions, on the incidence of strawberry anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum acutatum.', 0.5158933401107788]]\nContext 4: [['Smith, B.J.

Early symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) include blackening of specific tissues of the strawberry. These symptoms progress with the enlargement of lesions, which hinder proper fruit development and lead to the formation of orange-colored spores within the lesions. Similar symptoms were noted on the petioles, with sunken and blackened tissues similar to those on the fruit, accompanied by the formation of an orange conidial mass.', 0.9950562715530396]]\nContext 1: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.', 0.9941231608390808]]\nContext 2: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.', 0.9924523234367371]]\nContext 3: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.9804866909980774]]\nContext 4: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9662630558013916]]\nContext 5: [['Smith, B.

Isolates of Colletotrichum fragariae were the most aggressive, causing lesions at an average of 38% of inoculation sites on all hosts except pepper. The percentage of infection for the other eight Colletotrichum species ranged from 5% to 25%. Strawberry was the most susceptible host, with 58% of petiole and 14% of leaf infections resulting in lesion development from all isolates. Conversely, pepper was the most resistant host, showing no symptom development on leaves or stems following inoculation with any isolate.

Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014).

However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The genus Colletotrichum represents a large number of economically important Ascomycete fungi that collectively cause anthracnose disease or leaf blights on significant agricultural crops and ornamental plants worldwide. Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.28207093477249146]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum species are primarily recognized as the causal agents of anthracnose, which occurs on various plant parts, including leaves, stems, flowers, and fruits. The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).', 0.26335710287094116]]\nContext 2: [['Significant advancements in the taxonomy of the C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum species complexes have been made by Weir et al. (2012) and Damm et al. (2012a). However, the biological characteristics, such as temperature preferences, host range, and pathogenicity of different Colletotrichum species, remain unclear. Many pathogens are sensitive to temperature, rainfall, and humidity (Harvell et al. 2002; Wilson et al. 1990). Temperature is a critical factor influencing plant disease epidemics, as it can affect spore germination, infection rates, latent periods, sporulation, spore survival, and host resistance to various pathogens (Bonde et al. 2012; Wilson et al. 1990). High temperatures and their frequency can delay or even prevent the onset of plant diseases (Bonde et al. 2012, 2013). Conversely, the adaptation of pathogens to temperature plays a vital role in disease emergence.', 0.24645085632801056]]\nContext 3: [['Bailey, J. A., O\u2019Connell, R. J., Pring, R.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.25535550713539124]]\nContext 8: [['Cannon, P.

This type of fruit drop is unique among diseases caused by C. acutatum, as symptoms are induced by plant hormones. Natural fruit abscission typically occurs at the peduncle base, but postbloom fruit drop results in abscission at the fruit's base, leaving persistent calyces and peduncles.

Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production.

Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended.

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].', 0.993316650390625]]\nContext 1: [['Nursery surveys confirmed the intensive use of QoI fungicides. Single-site fungicides, such as QoIs, have frequently been used in nurseries to control anthracnose and other diseases, ensuring the delivery of symptom-free stock material. Along with commercial products containing only azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin, premixes with QoI fungicides were also utilized. This has led to an increased selection rate for QoI-resistant populations as early as the nursery phase. Since transplants produced in large nurseries are sold to smaller ones, plants may be exposed to multiple QoI applications throughout each propagation phase. Consequently, during the fruit production phase, growers face challenges in controlling anthracnose outbreaks with limited effective chemical options.', 0.9923279881477356]]\nContext 2: [['For the management of anthracnose crown rot, water washing or fungicide treatments of bare-root transplants have been utilized in the nursery or immediately before planting in production fields (Daugovish et al., 2009; Freeman et al., 1997). Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).', 0.9625529050827026]]\nContext 3: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population. For example, benomyl effectively reduced the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), rendering benomyl ineffective for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.', 0.9338117241859436]]\nContext 4: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose.

Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.8953297734260559]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8652259707450867]]\nContext 2: [['From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County.

ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant.

Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012).

It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex.

The conidial morphology of C. gloeosporioides and C. lindemuthianum is similar, but their cultural characters are distinctly different. Colletotrichum lindemuthianum produces dark pigmentation in media and grows consistently slower than C. gloeosporioides (Baxter et al., 1983; Sutton, 1992). Likewise, C. musae grows relatively fast, forming effuse colonies and glabrous conidiomata with many conidia, while C. destructivum forms large conidiogenous zones with scattered, relatively short setae and has limited conidial production (Baxter et al., 1983). The shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as cultural characteristics, should be evaluated and used with caution, as these traits are highly dependent on growth conditions. Erroneous diagnosis can largely be avoided if morphology is used in conjunction with other characters such as molecular sequence data, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and host range. Crouch et al. (2009b) demonstrated that falcate-spored, grass-associated Colletotrichum species could be distinguished by a combination of molecular data, appressorial morphology, and host range.

Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966).

Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.', 0.6484130620956421]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5290126204490662]]\nContext 2: [['Madden, L.V., Wilson, L.L., Ellis, M.A. 1993.

These terms are synonymous with race-non-specific and race-specific resistance, respectively. In pathosystems where race-specific resistance occurs, an incompatible interaction between the host and pathogen often requires a dominant host resistance gene and a dominant pathogen avirulence gene. Such interactions are described by the gene-for-gene hypothesis. Race-non-specific resistance is less understood but is believed to be governed by multiple host genes that incrementally contribute to the overall resistance of the plant. Vanderplank proposed using analysis of variance to determine the contribution of race-non-specific and/or race-specific resistance within a host population against a group of pathogen isolates. The absence of a cultivar by isolate interaction is evidence of race-non-specific resistance using this method. A cultivar by isolate interaction suggests that race-specific mechanisms contribute to the resistance observed within the host population, although deviations from additivity could be responsible for the statistical interaction.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The role of alternative hosts in the disease cycles caused by C. acutatum is also not well understood. The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.', 0.9951646327972412]]\nContext 1: [['Some host plants appear to be particularly susceptible to infection by multiple Colletotrichum taxa. The occurrence of species on strawberry has been well researched due to the former status of C. acutatum as a regulated quarantine pathogen. We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.', 0.993722140789032]]\nContext 2: [['C. acutatum was first described as a separate species by Simmonds. Many isolates now identified as C. acutatum were either classified under C. gloeosporioides or considered species of Gloeo sporium. C. acutatum affects hosts that are also targeted by other Colletotrichum species, possibly leading to its earlier misidentification. For instance, strawberries can be affected by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae. The latter two typically cause petiole and stolon lesions, as well as crown rot on strawberries.', 0.9935407042503357]]\nContext 3: [['On strawberry plants, C. acutatum primarily causes black spot disease on the fruit but can also affect crowns, roots, and leaves (Freeman & Katan 1997), making it one of the most serious diseases in commercial fruit production. The conidia are formed in acervuli on the host, while in culture, they can also be produced in the aerial mycelium (Johnston & Jones 1997). C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on living strawberry leaves, stimulated by extracts from the strawberry plant, especially flower extracts (Leandro et al. 2001; Leandro et al. 2003). According to Buddie et al. (1999), secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia, and these are generally smaller and more variable in shape, which can obscure the differences between taxa. Additionally, C. acutatum forms simple pigmented appressoria but has few or no setae (Simmonds 1965).', 0.9926853179931641]]\nContext 4: [['In Israel, where strawberries are cultivated near crops such as tomato, eggplant, pepper, and other vegetables, as well as various weed species, the potential for cross-inoculation is of extreme importance. An identical genotype of C. acutatum was recovered from natural field infections of both strawberry and anemone in Israel. Therefore, the main objectives of this study were to assess the persistence and interactions of C. acutatum on its primary host, strawberry, and other plant species that may serve as potential inoculum sources for this pathogen under suitable conditions.', 0.9891195297241211]]\nContext 5: [['In Israel, inoculation of isolates of C. acutatum from anemone and strawberry into each host resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms on both plant species. Molecular studies indicated that the isolates from the two hosts were similar and formed a single genetic subgroup. Isolates of C. acutatum were recovered from pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, as well as from weeds of the genera Vicia and Conyza; however, disease symptoms occurred only on strawberry. C. acutatum isolates from tulip tree in Argentina were also pathogenic to strawberry fruit. Thus, strawberry isolates of C. acutatum can parasitize and cause disease on other hosts or, alternatively, survive on other crops and weeds without producing symptoms.', 0.9887222051620483]]\nContext 6: [['Colletotrichum acutatum isolates produced fusiform conidia that were tapered at both ends, developed colonies in colors including white, pink, orange, rose, or beige, and did not produce setae or the ascigerous state in culture. The growth rate of C. acutatum in culture was slower than that of the other two species at all tested temperatures, with the greatest difference observed at 32\u00b0C. C. fragariae, the original anthracnose fungus, was first identified in Florida in 1931 (Brooks, 1931). It spread throughout the southeastern United States and was responsible for crown rot and the death of many plants in strawberry nurseries during the 1970s (Horn et al., 1972). This pathogen has a narrow host range, infecting only strawberries and a few weed hosts, and is rarely found outside the southeastern United States.', 0.9857739210128784]]\nContext 7: [['While C. acutatum infections are frequently observed in strawberry production fields, it has been suggested that quiescently infected transplants from nurseries serve as the primary inoculum source for field infections (Howard et al. 1992; Peres et al. 2005).

This aligns with the detection of C. fragariae, pathogenic to strawberry, on weeds such as chickweed, coffeeweed, sicklepod, fiddleneck, and vetch, growing in containers and around nurseries in Florida. Similarly, strawberry and anemone cultivated in close proximity in Israel were found to be infected by an identical genotype of C. acutatum.', 0.9847692251205444]]\nContext 9: [['Fungal isolates: The 62 isolates of C. acutatum isolated from strawberry were selected from various collections representing a range of isolation dates (1978 to 1998) and geographic regions worldwide.

Among these 81 isolates, 22 exhibiting pink chromogenic coloring in culture are referred to as C. acutatum chromogenic. Additionally, 13 isolates of C. gloeosporioides from strawberries originating from Europe and the United States, as well as one isolate from mango used as an outgroup, were studied. All isolates were single-conidia cultures. Stock cultures were maintained on silica gel at 4\u00b0C as described by Perkins. Cultures were initiated by transferring silica gel particles from the stock cultures to PDA (Potato Dextrose Agar) plates to produce fungal material for molecular analysis and pathogenicity tests.

This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae. Reports from literature and preliminary studies using ITS sequence data indicated that C. boninense represents a species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognized here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii, and 12 previously undescribed species: C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae, and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are known only from New Zealand, possibly reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was established, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and renamed as C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening, which may extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, and conidia featuring a prominent basal scar. Many species in the C. boninense complex form teleomorphs in culture.', 0.9849270582199097]]\nContext 5: [['None of the morphological characters of C. boninense allow for unequivocal identification, and misplacement of strains based solely on morphology is common. For instance, Lu et al. (2004) classified one isolate as C. gloeosporioides based on morphological features but re-identified it as C. boninense using molecular techniques. Colletotrichum dracaenae Petch (here epitypified and renamed as C. petchii) was considered a synonym of C. gloeosporioides by von Arx (1957). Our study indicates that C. petchii does not belong to C. gloeosporioides s. lat. but rather to the C. boninense species complex, although its conidia largely resemble those of C. gloeosporioides with their relatively large length/width ratio.', 0.9837046265602112]]\nContext 6: [['Damm U, Cannon PF, Woudenberg JH, Johnston PR, and Weir BS et al.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9239203333854675]]\nContext 2: [['Howard CM, Albregts EE.

The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).', 0.9976252913475037]]\nContext 1: [['Traditionally, Colletotrichum species are identified based on morphological characteristics, including conidial and appressorial size and shape, the presence of acervuli, setae, or sclerotia, sexual structures, and cultural traits such as growth rate and colony color.

Consequently, all available morphological characteristics are often combined and used for systematic species discrimination.', 0.9965277314186096]]\nContext 2: [['Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998). Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity.

One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9646943807601929]]\nContext 1: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide.

Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8494832515716553]]\nContext 1: [['From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.', 0.7786917090415955]]\nContext 2: [['In November 2021, anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberries (cv. Kingsberry) in Nonsan, Chungnam Province. Early symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) include blackening of specific tissues of the strawberry. These symptoms progress with the enlargement of lesions, which hinder proper fruit development and lead to the formation of orange-colored spores within the lesions. Similar symptoms were noted on the petioles, with sunken and blackened tissues similar to those on the fruit, accompanied by the formation of an orange conidial mass.', 0.7540948390960693]]\nContext 3: [['The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum. Strawberry anthracnose diseases have been reported to be caused by C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (the teleomorph of Cromereilla cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), and C. dematium (Pers.) Grove. The latter species only occasionally causes strawberry fruit rots and will not be discussed here.', 0.7383751273155212]]\nContext 4: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.', 0.7378320693969727]]\nContext 5: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.678008496761322]]\nContext 6: [['Howard CM, Albregts EE. Anthracnose.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.980258584022522]]\nContext 1: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit.

Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The phytopathogenic fungus Colletotrichum truncatum infects and colonizes chili fruit through direct penetration of the cuticle. The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.', 0.9469877481460571]]\nContext 1: [['The ex-type strain was included in the study by Nirenberg et al.

In drop inoculation tests, strains from this clade were observed to cause typical anthracnose symptoms on chili fruits. Other species (or species complexes) causing chili diseases were reported by Than et al. (2008a), identifying isolates as C. gloeosporioides and C. capsici. The latter taxon was subsequently synonymized with C. truncatum by Damm et al. (2009).

Several DNA phylogenetic studies have identified Colletotrichum species that infect chili in various countries. Despite China being the largest producer of chili, with significant multi-gene analysis, little is known about the species affecting local crops. In this study, samples of diseased chili were collected from 29 provinces in China, resulting in the isolation of 1,285 strains. We observed and compared the morphological characteristics of all strains, and performed multi-locus phylogenetic analyses (ITS, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, GAPDH, TUB2, and HIS3) on selected representative strains. Fifteen Colletotrichum species were identified, with C. fioriniae, C. fructicola, C. gloeosporioides, C. scovillei, and C. truncatum being the most prevalent.

Isolate UOM 1137 was pathogenic in both wound and non-wound bioassays and was classified in the most virulent C. siamense pathotype group (PCg1-R) in Mongkolporn et al. (2010). This contrasts with the study by Manamgoda et al. (2013), where C. endophyticum was described as an endophyte of Pennisetum purpureum.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9833609461784363]]\nContext 1: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species.

Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch.

Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).', 0.2609259784221649]]\nContext 7: [['Bailey, J.A., & Jeger, M.J.

The internal cutinase fragment (from 17 bp to 532 bp) was amplified with primers SmaI-CutS-F and XbaI-CutS-R to generate the sense (540 bp) and with primers BamHI-CutAS-F and XhoI-CutAS-R to generate the antisense (541 bp).

Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al.

The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

For example, C. lupini was not formally recognized as separate from C. acutatum by Talhinhas et al. (2002) or by Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005). Some attempts were made to address these concerns through the adoption of formae speciales, such as C. acutatum f. sp. pineum (Dingley & Gilmour 1972), C. acutatum f. sp. hakeae (Lubbe et al. 2004), and C. acutatum f. sp. fioriniae (Marcelino et al. 2008).

This clade comprises closely related species predominantly found on various hosts in Central and South America, distinguished primarily by GAPDH and TUB2 sequences. For instance, C. lupini was originally described as G. sorghicola. Some strains from apple in this study were identified as C. melonis and the new species, C. paranaense.

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al. (1992) reported differences between nitrate and ammonium-N (each at 225 mg\u00b7L\u20131).', 0.9526850581169128]]\nContext 4: [['Heremans (1996) developed a rapid method for screening tomato plant resistance to Fusarium oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici (Med.

Jarvis (1988, 1992) contributed significantly to managing diseases in greenhouse crops (Phytoprotection 69:49\u201364; APS Press, St. Paul, Minn.). Jarvis and Thorpe (1980, 1981) studied the effects of nitrate and ammonia nitrate on Fusarium severity and soil amendment with lettuce residues for disease control (Plant Dis. 64:309\u2013310; Can.

Fusarium oxysporum has a relatively high requirement for micronutrients (Jones et al., 1989). Concentrations of zinc, iron, manganese, and other metals above typical levels found in soil and nutrient solutions stimulate fungal growth and sporulation (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Jones et al., 1989). The profile of secondary metabolites produced by the pathogen, including phytotoxic compounds like fusaric acid, is also altered (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997; Egli, 1969). Nitrates inhibit both sporulation and spore germination, while ammonium has the opposite effect (Jones et al., 1989). Fertilization with nitrate-N decreases tomato sensitivity to fusaric acid, a phytotoxin produced in infected plants by Fusarium oxysporum (Barna et al., 1983). Zinc increases the susceptibility of tomatoes to fungal attack, partly because it raises the sugar level in plant tissues (Jarvis, 1992). Host susceptibility can also be altered by interactions between minerals, especially at elevated concentrations, impacting the availability of other nutrients. For instance, ammonium-N interferes with the uptake of nitrates and potassium, which in turn stimulates chloride uptake, leading to increased susceptibility of tomatoes to F. oxysporum f.sp. lycopersici (Jarvis, 1992). Disease suppression with minerals has also been attributed to the stimulation of indigenous populations of antagonistic microorganisms in the soil and rhizosphere (Elmer, 1995; Engelhard, 1989). While this is generally not relevant to hydroponics, recent work indicates that minerals can be utilized to enhance the beneficial activity of introduced biocontrol agents in soilless culture (Duffy and D\u00e9fago, 1997).', 0.8857102394104004]]\nContext 6: [['The influence of various mineral nutrients on Fusarium crown and root rot was evaluated in a non-circulating hydroponics system.

Another possible factor may be total calcium concentrations, which are increased with liming and with calcium nitrates as used in our study and that of Woltz et al. (1992). They found that all treatments that increased calcium content also reduced disease. While adequate calcium in tomato tissues appears to be important for resistance to cell-wall-degrading enzymes (e.g., polygalacturonase) produced by Fusarium sp., it is generally considered a minor factor in controlling disease (Jones et al., 1989).', 0.7843050956726074]]\nContext 8: [['The influence of nitrogen nutrition on the sensitivity of tomato plants to culture filtrates of Fusarium and to fusaric acid is discussed in \"Physiology and Plant Pathology,\" volume 23, pages 257\u2013263.

(1992) and provide a foundation for developing a control strategy based on plant nutrition.

The effects of mineral nutrients on crown and root rot of tomatoes caused by F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycospersici were similar to those reported for other formae speciales, reflecting the adaptability of control strategies for various Fusarium diseases. This further suggests a biological similarity of these pathogens and/or similar responses of diverse hosts to these fungi. However, fusarium crown and root rot is not the only issue threatening hydroponically grown tomatoes, and nontarget effects of certain mineral nutrients on other diseases must be considered. A prominent example is nitrate-N, which reduces crown and root rot but increases the severity of economically devastating diseases caused by Pythium and phytopathogenic bacteria (Stanghellini and Rasmussen, 1994). Integrating mineral nutrients with newly developed resistant cultivars, biocontrol agents, and/or fungicides used at reduced, non-phytotoxic concentrations may enhance the level and spectrum of disease control.', 0.5346574187278748]]\n"

Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al.

(2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex. In contrast, C. hymenocallidis appressoria are ovate or sometimes clavate.', 0.9208623170852661]]\nContext 1: [['The first simplification in the design of our model concerns the role of sexual spores in the Colletotrichum life cycle. Sexual fruiting bodies (perithecia) can be produced on artificial media by species in the gloeosporioides, destructivum, and graminicola clades (De Silva et al., 2017). However, perithecia rarely occur in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), and the asexual stage is considered the sole or main type of inoculum in disease development. The model, therefore, focuses on the asexual stage of Colletotrichum, with asexual spores (conidia) produced in acervuli being regarded as the only inoculum responsible for the development of anthracnose epidemics. Excluding a possible (even though unlikely) ascosporic inoculum could lead to an underestimation of the total inoculum dose in the first phase of epidemics (the so-called lag phase; Schein, 1963), potentially delaying epidemic growth (Schein, 1963), especially during rainless periods. This is because ascospores can be forcibly discharged from perithecia even in the absence of rain if there is sufficient humidity (Aylor and Anagnostakis, 1991; Manstretta and Rossi, 2016).', 0.9092692732810974]]\nContext 2: [['Conidia of Colletotrichum are produced in masses immersed in a water-soluble mucilage in reproductive structures known as acervulae, which serve to prevent desiccation. The germination of conidia is inhibited by the mucilage, necessitating its dissolution for germination. Consequently, conidial release and dispersal, as well as the occurrence of disease epidemics, are heavily dependent on free water and water splash. Dispersal of C. acutatum is favored by prolonged rainfall, while brief periods of precipitation are effective for short-distance dispersal among plants.', 0.9061999917030334]]\nContext 3: [['Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characteristics. Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008). However, these criteria alone are not always sufficient for reliable differentiation among Colletotrichum species due to variations in morphology and phenotype influenced by environmental factors.', 0.799850344657898]]\nContext 4: [['Although different lifestyles have been described for Colletotrichum spp. (i.e., necrotrophic, biotrophic, hemibiotrophic, quiescent, and endophytic lifestyles), these species share some common attributes in their life cycles (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017), which include both sexual and asexual reproduction. The perithecial stage is rarely observed in the field (Dowling et al., 2020), making asexual conidia the most critical stage for disease development. Therefore, our model focuses on the asexual life cycle. A general asexual life cycle for Colletotrichum spp. is illustrated in Figure 1.', 0.7601150274276733]]\nContext 5: [['In the figure presented, conidia of five Colletotrichum species from strawberry are displayed. Specifically, it shows conidia from: A) Colletotrichum murrayae, B) C. fructicola, C) C. gloeosporioides, D) C. aenigma, and E) C. nymphaeae. Conidial suspensions for each species were prepared in lactic acid from conidial masses on potato dextrose agar.', 0.7440334558486938]]\nContext 6: [['There were three types of conidia observed in the three species of Colletotrichum: cylindrical, fusiform, and falcate. Isolates of C. capsici from group 5 produced falcate conidia, while C. acutatum isolates from groups 3 and 4 predominantly produced fusiform conidia (with an average occurrence of 80%). Isolates of C. gloeosporioides from groups 1 and 2 produced cylindrical conidia. However, there was little distinction among the groups regarding the size of the conidia.', 0.73395836353302]]\nContext 7: [['Available morphological characters of Colletotrichum species include: 1) characters on natural substrates, such as size and shape of conidiomata (acervuli), conidia, conidiophores, and setae; 2) size and shape of conidia, conidiophores, and setae in culture; and 3) size and shape of appressoria. Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966). Morphological characters may vary with environmental factors, and incubation conditions, such as media and temperature, should be standardized (Cannon et al., 2000) for species comparison and identification. Unfortunately, there is no recommended standard for...', 0.7067466974258423]]\nContext 8: [['Conidia are formed directly from the germ tube of a germinating primary conidium, and these are smaller and more irregular in form than those from which they are derived (Buddie et al. 1999). Additionally, older strains, especially if they have been frequently subcultured, may exhibit more variable conidia in appearance than those derived from recent stock. Nirenberg et al. (2002) observed that shapes differed among conidia formed in acervuli and in the aerial mycelium. The variation in conidial shape has led to species within the C. acutatum complex being incorrectly placed into synonymy with other Colletotrichum species, primarily C. gloeosporioides\u2014this is a legacy of the revision of the genus by von Arx (1957). His work marked a new era in the understanding of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al. 2012, this issue), but many of the synonymies proposed were inaccurate.', 0.703898549079895]]\nContext 9: [['Cultural characteristics on agar media have been applied for the diagnosis of some Colletotrichum species (von Arx, 1957). The conidial morphology of C. gloeosporioides and C. lindemuthianum is similar, but their cultural characters are distinctly different. Colletotrichum lindemuthianum produces dark pigmentation in media and grows consistently slower than C. gloeosporioides (Baxter et al., 1983; Sutton, 1992). Likewise, C. musae grows relatively fast, forming effuse colonies and glabrous conidiomata with many conidia, while C. destructivum forms large conidiogenous zones with scattered, relatively short setae and has limited conidial production (Baxter et al., 1983). The shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as cultural characteristics, should be evaluated and used with caution, as these traits are highly dependent on growth conditions. Erroneous diagnosis can largely be avoided if morphology is used in conjunction with other characters such as molecular sequence data, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and host range. Crouch et al. (2009b) demonstrated that falcate-spored, grass-associated Colletotrichum species could be distinguished by a combination of molecular data, appressorial morphology, and host range. However, for most Colletotrichum species, host range has not been determined, and available information should be considered with caution, as it is often based on wrongly identified species (Damm et al., 2009).', 0.6885568499565125]]\n"

The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).', 0.9973015785217285]]\nContext 1: [['Traditional identification systems in Colletotrichum have heavily relied on morphological and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980, 1992; Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 1998).

Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management.

One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9737247824668884]]\nContext 1: [[\"The strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa), a small fruit crop, was introduced to Bangladesh in 1996 from Japan and the USA, gaining notable acceptance among both growers and consumers.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.7703464031219482]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi, with many of the 200 plus species known to cause disease in crop plants worldwide (Alahakoon et al. 1994; Rojas et al. 2010; Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012a, 2012b; Udayanga et al. 2013; Shivas et al. 2016; De Silva et al. 2017a).', 0.2708074152469635]]\nContext 2: [['Bailey, J.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.7226905822753906]]\nContext 1: [['Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop.

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5195391774177551]]\nContext 6: [['Shao, X.

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease.

In a later study using a different set of isolates, only cultivar susceptibility varied. For C. acutatum, a specific interaction between strawberry cultivars and isolates was noted, with a single dominant gene appearing to be responsible for this interaction. This gene results in either an incompatible reaction with cultivars carrying it or an intermediate degree of compatibility.

Colonies of C. acutatum are usually white initially but later become covered with pink to orange conidial masses. Cultures from certain hosts are highly chromogenic and excrete red and pink pigments into the culture media. The primary production of conidia occurs in acervuli; however, C. acutatum can also form secondary conidia on the surfaces of living leaves. Conidia are typically ellipsoid and fusiform at least at one end, differing from C. gloeosporioides, which generally has both ends rounded. Setae are usually sparse or not produced at all. Pigmented appressoria form upon germination of the conidia and vary in shape and size.', 0.9956550598144531]]\nContext 1: [['C. acutatum, as noted by various studies (Peres et al. 2008; Lee et al. 2007; Talhinhas et al. 2011; Polashock et al. 2009; Wharton & Schilder 2008), has a well-known morphological feature: the shape of its conidia, which are characterized by acute ends (Simmonds 1965). However, other conidial shapes are frequently encountered, particularly cylindrical forms with only one acute end. These variations are often observed in strains that have been repeatedly subcultured, as well as in the \u201cterminal crook\u201d disease of pine (Dingley & Gilmour 1972) and in the anthracnose affecting leather leaf fern (Schiller et al. 2006). There are also reports of disseminated infections in sea turtles (Manire et al. 2002) and infections in scale insects (Marcelino et al. 2008). Differentiating between C. acutatum (s. lat.) and C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is challenging due to the existence of many intermediate strains that exhibit a limited number of typical fusiform conidia alongside numerous cylindrical ones (Van der Aa et al. 1990).', 0.993974506855011]]\nContext 2: [['Recently, more focus has been placed on conidium morphology, particularly shape and dimensions. The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

In contrast, C. acutatum isolates produced fusiform conidia that were tapered at both ends, developed colonies in white, pink, orange, rose, or beige, and did not form setae or the ascigerous state in culture.

Several morphological types have been observed within a population of C. gloeosporioides from avocado grown in culture (T. Katan, unpublished): (i) conidial type, with masses of conidia and no aerial mycelium; (ii) flat mycelial type, with very little aerial mycelium or conidia; (iii) mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium; (iv) conidial-mycelial type, with dense aerial mycelium and masses of conidia; (v) protoperithecial type, similar to type iv but also producing dark protoperithecia-like hyphal aggregates; and (vi) perithecial type, with simple or complex perithecia.', 0.9874628186225891]]\nContext 5: [['Generally, conidia of C. acutatum are elliptic-fusiform in shape, whereas conidia of C. gloeosporioides are oblong with obtuse ends.

However, the growth rate of C. gloeosporioides isolates from almond in Israel was slow and did not differ significantly from that of C. acutatum from strawberry.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al.

Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.', 0.986487090587616]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is a significant disease affecting grape crops (Dowling et al., 2020).

The most visible anthracnose symptoms are black or dark brown sunken lesions that contain conidial masses on the surface of infected fruits. Small individual lesions can merge to form larger lesions.

Numerous studies have reported subgroups within the C. acutatum species complex. A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3) involving 331 strains previously identified as C. acutatum and related taxa\u2014spanning various hosts across diverse geographic regions\u2014confirmed the previously recognized molecular groups and identified several novel taxa. Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.', 0.6365334987640381]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum acutatum has been regarded as a pathogen of countless host plant species and is thought to occur everywhere. Sreenivasaprasad & Talhinhas (2005) discovered that C. acutatum group A5, accepted here as C. acutatum s. str., occurs only on certain hosts, primarily in the southern hemisphere. This study confirms that C. acutatum s. str. does indeed have multiple hosts, but the known host spectrum is much smaller than previously accepted.', 0.4981650710105896]]\nContext 2: [['Few investigations into cross-pathogenicity and the host range of C. acutatum isolates in nature have been conducted. If this pathogen truly has a broad host range and can move freely between hosts, it is intriguing that it has formed unique relationships with each plant species. Many researchers face limitations due to narrow crop responsibilities, inadequate facilities for handling temperate or tropical crops, or restrictions imposed by biosecurity regulations, which have hindered studies of host ranges using large numbers of isolates. With innovation and cooperative efforts, it may be possible to conduct some of these studies, ultimately enhancing our understanding of pathogen movement and host interactions.', 0.486349493265152]]\nContext 3: [['The holotype of Glomerella acutata is therefore an interspecific hybrid between C. acutatum and C. fioriniae. This may be construed as strong evidence that these two taxa constitute a single biological species, suggesting that the species concepts used in this paper are too narrow. However, the parent strains of the holotype originate from geographically distant populations, and there are instances in other fungal groups (e.g., Neurospora) where non-sympatric populations lose post-mating reproductive isolation barriers (Turner et al. 2010, 2011). Further research on population structures and mating-type barriers would be instructive.', 0.4365829825401306]]\nContext 4: [['Considering the frequency with which strains from the C. acutatum species complex are encountered and their pathogenicity to a wide range of crop plants, it would be surprising if earlier names for C. acutatum did not exist. Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.', 0.40276995301246643]]\nContext 5: [['Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016). In a few cases, associations have been noted with marine ecosystems (Manire et al., 2002; Namikoshi et al., 2002).

C. acutatum isolates from tulip tree in Argentina were also pathogenic to strawberry fruit.

During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae.

Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

Surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected from affected areas, specifically strawberry nurseries and production fields in six states across the United States. The use of fungicides, particularly quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been widely employed for controlling C. acutatum for the past 20 years. Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group. This situation necessitates immediate changes in anthracnose management strategies to incorporate other chemical and non-chemical approaches, aiming to limit the selection of resistant populations and prevent future outbreaks.', 0.9910125136375427]]\nContext 1: [['Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.', 0.9888896942138672]]\nContext 2: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.', 0.988569438457489]]\nContext 3: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production.

Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group.

Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.6689209342002869]]\nContext 1: [['Smith, B.J. 2007.

As noted previously, while increasing density might lead to more units becoming infected, the rising total number of units could result in a constant or even decreasing proportion of diseased units. There is clear evidence from certain systems that the dispersal of spores or other microscopic particles, such as pollen, diminishes as plant density increases. Interestingly, recent studies showing no correlation between plant density and disease in natural systems have focused on heteroecious rusts, which do not have secondary spread.

In 1982, the first incidence of anthracnose disease in strawberries caused by C. acutatum s.l. was recorded in the UK, attributed to the importation of infected strawberry runners from the USA. DNA sequences in public databases suggest that two UK isolates (CBS198.35 and CBS199.35), collected in 1935 from Phormium spp. (New Zealand flax), belong to C. acutatum s.l. CABI database records from 1978 to 1983 show the incidence of the pathogen on various hosts and in different UK locations. However, it seems improbable that the initial outbreak on strawberries led to widespread dispersal of the pathogen. In 1993, Lovelidge proposed that continued introduction of infected strawberry material from abroad made the disease likely to become endemic in the UK. Subsequent years saw further outbreaks on strawberries linked to the importation of infected propagation material, mainly from mainland Europe, as well as on other important crop hosts.', 0.857723593711853]]\nContext 1: [['Clonal isolates were analyzed to confirm or reject the hypothesis of host specialization of CA-clonal isolates on strawberry. Sreenivasaprasad et al. (26) suggested that European isolates of C. acutatum infecting strawberry are distinct from U.S. C. acutatum isolates found in a variety of hosts. In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable. Furthermore, C. acutatum on strawberry is prevalent in Europe and various parts of the United States, including California. Freeman and Katan (7) also observed identical RAPD patterns in pathogen isolates from both countries, suggesting that C. acutatum was introduced from the United States into Israel.', 0.6571211814880371]]\nContext 2: [['Colletotrichum acutatum s.l. was first described as a strawberry pathogen in California in 1983 and has since spread worldwide, including the UK, through runners and propagating material.

Cultures from certain hosts are highly chromogenic and excrete red and pink pigments into the culture media. The primary production of conidia occurs in acervuli; however, C. acutatum can also form secondary conidia on the surfaces of living leaves. Conidia are typically ellipsoid and fusiform at least at one end, differing from C. gloeosporioides, which generally has both ends rounded. Setae are usually sparse or not produced at all.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8355491757392883]]\nContext 1: [['Hartman, J.

The fungus is cosmopolitan and causes significant crop losses annually. Symptoms of the disease can include fruit rots, as well as shoot, leaf, and flower blights. Common hosts encompass many dicotyledonous plants, including strawberries, apples, citrus, and stone fruits; serious diseases have also been reported on leatherleaf ferns and pines. Notably, there are no known reports of C. acutatum affecting grasses. While well-documented from agricultural hosts, recent findings of C. acutatum in a moribund sea turtle and a native forest suggest it may inhabit other less-studied niches.', 0.9509510397911072]]\nContext 1: [['The role of alternative hosts in the disease cycles caused by C. acutatum is also not well understood. The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.', 0.9485364556312561]]\nContext 2: [['Members of the C. acutatum species complex have been well-documented from agricultural and natural hosts worldwide (Perfect et al., 1999; Peres et al., 2005; Sreenivasaprasad and Talhinhas, 2005). The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016).

However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.', 0.7526315450668335]]\nContext 5: [['Alternative lifestyles? Most reports of the natural recovery of C. acutatum have come from agricultural hosts. However, recent findings suggest that C. acutatum may inhabit a variety of unexplored niches.

Whether these isolates originated from agricultural ecosystems or represent a new source of pathogens remains largely unexamined.', 0.7373754978179932]]\nContext 6: [['In strawberries, C. acutatum is typically introduced into production fields from nurseries. While some plants may exhibit symptoms, often the pathogen is introduced through asymptomatic leaves or petioles, likely as appressoria or quiescent infections. It remains unclear whether quiescent infections develop into lesions or if appressoria germinate to produce conidia. However, conidia of C. acutatum can generate several secondary conidia from each deposited conidium on the leaf surface. This suggests that the fungus is reproducing by utilizing nutrients on the leaf surface rather than relying on reserves from the original conidium.

This aligns with the detection of C. fragariae, pathogenic to strawberry, on weeds such as chickweed, coffeeweed, sicklepod, fiddleneck, and vetch, growing in containers and around nurseries in Florida.

This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis.

These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.', 0.9914880990982056]]\nContext 2: [['Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose. Colletotrichum spp. can affect a wide range of hosts, and these pathogens are characterized by global distribution. Virtually every cultivated botanical family is susceptible to one or more species of Colletotrichum, making it one of the most studied plant pathogenic fungi (Prusky et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Dean et al., 2012). Common hosts include many dicotyledonous plants such as strawberry, apple, citrus, and stone fruits, as well as major cereals such as maize and sorghum. Members of this genus can cause crop losses of up to 100% in many staple foods (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 2000; Talhinhas et al., 2005; Cannon et al., 2012).', 0.9909023642539978]]\nContext 3: [['Various studies highlight the significance of Colletotrichum species in agriculture. Crouch et al. (2009) discussed anthracnose disease caused by the novel species Colletotrichum navitas, while Damm et al. (2013) addressed the Colletotrichum orbiculare species complex, which affects field crops and weeds. Other works by Damm et al. (2012) explored the Colletotrichum acutatum and Colletotrichum boninense species complexes.', 0.9882025122642517]]\nContext 4: [['A significant effort has been dedicated to identifying which species of Colletotrichum are involved in various anthracnose-type diseases of plants and developing tools for their identification and differentiation.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.9849313497543335]]\nContext 6: [['Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions (Cannon et al. 2012). The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight major plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three species or species complexes of Colletotrichum have been reported to cause anthracnose in strawberries: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae have narrower host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a few C. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al. 2016).', 0.9818411469459534]]\nContext 7: [['Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, causing disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum, each with a brief description. In recent years, molecular tools have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Some species have been segregated from the C. gloeosporioides complex based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, such as C. boninense.', 0.9645947813987732]]\nContext 8: [['Freeman, S., Katan, T., Shabi, E., 1998.

The G143A and F129L mutations in cytb were identified, conferring high and moderate resistance levels, respectively. In our study of California isolates, only the G143A mutation was detected, although only 11 resistant isolates were sequenced out of a total of 29 identified. All resistant isolates had EC50 values for azoxystrobin of >40 mg/ml, indicating high resistance; thus, other resistance genotypes may not be present in California at this time. Diseased plants that yielded resistant isolates originated from two of five California nursery sources and were collected in three of eight sampled counties. Resistance may currently be limited in distribution but could spread quickly with frequent movement of plant material. Population genetic analyses of isolates may provide insight into whether resistance developed independently in the two nurseries and in Florida. Resistance can be managed by using treatments with different modes of action. The availability of alternative fungicides is important, as resistance conferred by the G143A mutation typically cannot be mitigated using higher, off-label application rates of QoI compounds in the field (Bartlett et al. 2002; Fern\u00e1ndez-Ortu\u00f1o et al. 2012; Kim et al. 2003; Lesniak et al. 2011). Additionally, this mutation has been shown to be stable in C. acutatum populations and did not result in a fitness penalty in laboratory assays (Forcelini et al. 2018). In our study, QoI-resistant and -sensitive isolates were similarly pathogenic; however, disease severity and mortality after inoculation with resistant isolates were higher than those for QoI-sensitive isolates. Several studies on other fungal pathogens have indicated that resistant isolates harboring the G143A mutation did not exhibit reduced fitness compared to wild-type sensitive isolates (Corio-Costet et al. 2011; Karaoglanidis et al. 2011; Rallos et al. 2014).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014).

Evidence indicates that three different species\u2014C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae\u2014are associated with strawberry production in the UK, corresponding to previously designated genetic groups A2, A4, and A3, respectively.

Fungi of the genus Colletotrichum, which are ancient and co-evolved with flowering plants, rank eighth among the ten most economically important fungal pathogens and have diversified to adapt to various hosts. Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years. A total of 23 Colletotrichum species, clustered into five species complexes and two singleton taxa, have been accepted as strawberry pathogens with a global occurrence illustrated. The relative prevalence of distinct Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries has been systematically analyzed in China. Finally, the host range of the two prevailing species, C. fructicola and C. siamense, which cause significant damage globally, is summarized, with the goal of improving diagnostic accuracy and anthracnose management in agricultural ecosystems.', 0.6588901877403259]]\nContext 4: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.4680938720703125]]\nContext 5: [['Maas, J.

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot.

Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5760337114334106]]\nContext 1: [['Overall, the study highlights the importance of cultural practices and genetic resistance in managing strawberry anthracnose effectively.', 0.41100990772247314]]\nContext 2: [['Although strawberries are considered a minor crop, they provide a significant source of income for many fruit and nursery growers. In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.', 0.3418314754962921]]\nContext 3: [['Shao, X.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population. In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action. Natural products have also been evaluated as alternative fungicides, offering different modes of action, lower toxicity, and increased efficacy (Abril et al., 2008).', 0.7114839553833008]]\nContext 1: [['Additionally, multisite fungicides such as captan, thiram, and chlorothalonil, which have been available for many decades, remain effective in reducing strawberry anthracnose incidence (Mertely et al. 2018). Chlorothalonil is only registered for nonbearing nurseries when flowers and fruit are absent, yet our surveys indicated that its usage is significantly lower compared to newer single-site fungicides. Due to their efficacy and low resistance risk, multisite fungicides should be the mainstay for disease control in strawberry nurseries. Other non-chemical alternatives, such as heat (Wang et al. 2017) and ultraviolet treatments (Onofre et al. 2017), are currently under investigation and could serve as valuable tools for disease management, reducing the reliance on single-site fungicides.', 0.6694579720497131]]\nContext 2: [['Finally, it is important to emphasize that strawberry production in Brazil remains heavily dependent on fungicide applications, which are not completely effective for anthracnose control and raise consumer concerns about food safety. Our study indicates that managing flower blight can be quite effective through a combination of cultural choices, which could potentially reduce dependency on chemical controls.', 0.5787334442138672]]\nContext 3: [['The experimental fungicide pydiflumetofen was not effective against C. acutatum in our in vitro and field studies. However, this fungicide is very active against B. cinerea and has shown high efficacy in reducing powdery mildew in strawberries (J. E. Adaskaveg, unpublished). The pydiflumetofen-fludioxonil premixture was among the most effective of our preplant dip treatments for crown rot in strawberries, likely due to the fludioxonil component. Therefore, this premixture has potential as a broad-spectrum post-plant field fungicide for strawberries.', 0.562638521194458]]\nContext 4: [['Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a significant disease affecting strawberry production. Surveys were conducted, and isolates were collected from affected areas, specifically strawberry nurseries and production fields in six states across the United States. The use of fungicides, particularly quinone outside inhibitors (QoIs), has been widely employed for controlling C. acutatum for the past 20 years. Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group.

It is especially prominent on members of Amaryllidaceae, Orchidaceae, Proteaceae, and Solanaceae.

A multilocus molecular phylogenetic analysis (ITS, ACT, TUB2, CHS-1, GAPDH, HIS3, CAL) of 86 strains previously identified as C. boninense and other related strains revealed 18 clades. These clades are recognized here as separate species, including C. boninense s. str., C. hippeastri, C. karstii, and 12 previously undescribed species: C. annellatum, C. beeveri, C. brassicicola, C. brasiliense, C. colombiense, C. constrictum, C. cymbidiicola, C. dacrycarpi, C. novae-zelandiae, C. oncidii, C. parsonsiae, and C. torulosum. Seven of the new species are known only from New Zealand, possibly reflecting a sampling bias. The new combination C. phyllanthi was established, and C. dracaenae Petch was epitypified and renamed as C. petchii. Typical for species of the C. boninense species complex are conidiogenous cells with prominent periclinal thickening, which may extend to form a new conidiogenous locus or annellations, and conidia featuring a prominent basal scar.

Regarding the combined datasets, even when excluding MAT1-2-1 to balance the sequence lengths, the Apn-MAT dataset exhibited 478 parsimony informative characters from a total of 1,886 (25%), while traditional markers contributed only 232 informative characters from a total of 1,965 (12%).', 0.42346376180648804]]\nContext 1: [['Table II presents key metrics for each dataset, including the length in base pairs (bp), the number and percentage of parsimony informative sites (PI; %PI), estimated nucleotide diversity (p), and the model of sequence evolution.

A combined dataset of the five gene regions was prepared using Clustal X v.1.81 (Thompson et al., 1997). Further alignment of sequences was achieved using default settings in MAFFT v.7 (Katoh & Toh, 2008, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), and manual adjustments were made using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999) where necessary. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed: one for the acutatum species complex and another for the gloeosporioides species complex. Maximum Parsimony analysis (MP) was performed using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) to obtain the most parsimonious trees. Gaps were treated as missing data, and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions. A maximum of 5,000 trees were set up, branches of zero length were collapsed, and all multiple parsimonious trees were saved. Descriptive tree statistics for parsimony\u2014Tree Length (TL), Consistency Index (CI), Retention Index (RI), Rescaled Consistency Index (RC), and Homoplasy Index (HI)\u2014were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. The robustness of the most parsimonious trees was evaluated by 1,000 bootstrap replications resulting from the maximum parsimony analysis (Hillis & Bull, 1993). Kishino-Hasegawa tests (KHT) (Kishino & Hasegawa, 1989) were performed to determine whether the trees were significantly different. Bayesian inference (BI) was also employed to construct the phylogenies using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Ronquist et al., 2003). MrModeltest v.2.3 (Nylander, 2004) was used to select the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution. The HYK+I model was selected for ITS, a HKY+G model for GAPDH and \u03b2-tubulin, a K80+I+G model for CHS-1, and a GTR+G model for ACT were incorporated into the analysis. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100th generation. The 2,000 trees representing the burn-in phase of the analyses were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree. The alignments and trees are deposited in TreeBASE (Sanderson et al., 1994) under accession number S20238.', 0.2238209843635559]]\nContext 3: [['The species we accept are based on a phylogenetic species concept, with all species forming strongly supported, monophyletic clades within our multigene phylogenies. However, not all terminal clades are recognized as named species. In most cases, any well-supported within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the multigene phylogeny is not resolved consistently across all gene trees. This lack of congruence between gene trees indicates that the diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although concatenating gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it can mask discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach (Figs. 3, 4B, 5B), combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesized to represent a single species, allowing for the estimation of the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates. Fig. 3 shows the results of such an analysis for the C. gloeosporioides complex, while Figs. 4B and 5B illustrate relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades, respectively, at an expanded scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae clades. This may be because, while species-tree algorithms account for incomplete lineage sorting (Heled & Drummond 2010, Chung & An\u00e9 2011), most do not compensate for horizontal gene transfer, reassortment, or introgression. Hybridization could also result in discordant gene phylogenies. Hybrids are known in the C. acutatum complex, such as Glomerella acutata, a hybrid formed by crossing C. acutatum and C. fioriniae strains in the laboratory, as well as a putative hybrid strain collected from terminal crook disease on Pinus in New Zealand, where both species coexist in nature (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue). Hybrids also form in the C. gloeosporioides complex, such as the Carya and Aeschynomene populations discussed by Cisar et al.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8709966540336609]]\nContext 1: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.9822708964347839]]\nContext 2: [['The histology of infection by Colletotrichum spp. has been studied thoroughly on several hosts.

It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex.

Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966).

All three Colletotrichum species can incite flower blights and fruit rots (Smith, 1998b). Fully open flowers are much more susceptible than closed buds (Smith, 2007). Infected green fruit are often hard, brown, and mummified rather than ripened.

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.9243087768554688]]\nContext 3: [['The ontogeny of the invasion process by Colletotrichum acutatum and C. fragariae was studied on the petioles and stolons of the strawberry cultivar Chandler using light and electron microscopy. The invasion of host tissue by each fungal species was similar; however, the invasion occurred more rapidly with C. fragariae than with C. acutatum. Following cuticular penetration via an appressorium, subsequent steps of invasion involved hyphal growth within the cuticle and within the cell walls of epidermal, subepidermal, and subtending cells. Both species of fungi are responsible for anthracnose diseases of strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) caused by the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.)

Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown worldwide but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they cause little injury. C. fragariae is most often associated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, humid regions such as the southeastern United States. Its host range is limited to strawberries and a few weeds. C. acutatum, on the other hand, is the primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot and has a broader geographic and host range than C. fragariae.

Strawberries (Fragaria ananassa) are a globally important small fruit crop, and the area dedicated to strawberry cultivation in China has rapidly increased in recent years. Under suitable environmental conditions, anthracnose can lead to significant yield losses (Henz et al. 1992). Infected strawberries may develop lesions on the petiole and crown, potentially resulting in plant collapse and death. In nurseries, lesions can form on stolons, leading to the wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants (Freeman and Katan 1997).

Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In Florida, USA, anthracnose can lead to the death of up to 80% of seedlings in nurseries and yield losses exceeding 50% in fields.

Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010).

After 60 days, the disease index of each plant was rated on a scale of 0 to 4: 0, healthy; 1, < 50% of petioles affected; 2, > 50% of petioles affected; 3, wilted; 4, necrosis formed on the entire plant (Nam et al., 2006). The disease index data from isolates were analyzed for means and standard error using the Costat program (CoHort Software, Berkeley, CA). All isolates caused anthracnose symptoms on the Seolhyang strawberry cultivar. The disease index for the isolates was highest (DI > 3) for CGF071204, CGF100713, and CGF110101. Smith and Black (1990) showed that the pathogenicity of C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, and C. fragariae can be differentiated by factors such as strawberry tissue and cultivars. C. gloeosporioides and C. acutatum were reported to have a wide host range, while C. fragariae was restricted to strawberry plants (Freeman et al., 1998; Hyde et al., 2009b).

The ITS region has a limited ability to discriminate clades within this group; hence, a more appropriate biomarker is required for barcoding. The ideal locus for use in barcoding should have low heterogeneity within species, yet enough variation to allow maximum separation of different species. The first requirement facilitates easy grouping and identification of strains from the same species, while the second minimizes misidentifications.

Since then, the availability of living ex-type strains and sequence data has provided a solid reference for comparison with isolates. However, criteria for species delimitation have been debated over the years, with Colletotrichum serving as a notable example (Cannon et al., 2008). Until recently, single-locus phylogenies dominated the molecular systematics of the C. gloeosporioides complex, despite their limited resolving ability (Sreenivasaprasad et al., 1993, 1996; Johnston and Jones, 1997; Nguyen et al., 2009; Polashock et al., 2009). Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b). Recognizing the limitations of ITS and similar markers has led to an increasing necessity for the development and use of more informative loci.

This approach is environmentally sound because it results in reduced fungicide use. As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases. Changes in cultural practices have resulted in reduced levels of disease. Simultaneously, the development of more effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have significantly reduced losses due to both anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot. Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also decreased economic losses caused by these diseases. Nevertheless, growers may still face severe losses when environmental conditions are highly favorable for anthracnose development.', 0.15244364738464355]]\n"

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5182308554649353]]\nContext 4: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide.

Thirty-one species are accepted, of which 21 have not been previously recognized. Colletotrichum orchidophilum clusters basal to the C. acutatum species complex. This complex exhibits high phenotypic diversity, with some species showing preferences for specific hosts or geographic regions, while others are plurivorous and found in multiple areas. In this study, only C. salicis and C. rhombiforme formed sexual morphs in culture; however, sexual morphs have been documented from other taxa, particularly in laboratory crosses, with evidence of hybridization between different species. A new species, C. pseudoacutatum, was also described, resembling C. acutatum but not belonging to its species complex.', 0.8502962589263916]]\nContext 2: [['Damm, U., Cannon, P.F., Woudenberg, J.K.C., and Crous, P.W. 2012.

Walker et al. (1991) found that C. xanthii (Halsted 1893) was synonymous with C. acutatum based on morphological criteria, but no authentic sequences are available, and it is currently unclear which clade this species fits into. At that time, there was no interest among Colletotrichum researchers to replace the name C. acutatum, and now the name is so widely used that a change would likely not gain recognition. Other older taxa have been recognized as belonging to the C. acutatum complex, but as close relatives rather than formal synonyms. Colletotrichum lupini was found to be an independent taxon within the C. acutatum complex by Nirenberg et al. (2002), rather than belonging to the C. gloeosporioides aggregate, as assumed by Yang & Sweetingham (1998) and Elmer et al. (2001). Farr et al. (2006) found C. phormii (based on Fusarium phormii, Hennings 1898) to be closely related to C. acutatum and noted that older reports of C. gloeosporioides as pathogens of Phormium could actually refer to C. phormii as well.', 0.4647778570652008]]\nContext 8: [['Damm, U., Cannon, P.F., Woudenberg, J.H.C., & Crous, P.W.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9420921206474304]]\nContext 1: [['Overall, the study highlights the importance of cultural practices and genetic resistance in managing strawberry anthracnose effectively.', 0.8529131412506104]]\nContext 2: [['Ballington, J.R., J.L.

Our findings support the hypothesis that combining oat rotation with NH4-N fertilization can reduce root diseases in plants. Both oat cultivars suppressed black root rot under the (NH4)2SO4 regime but differed in their effects on the two main pathogens. Saia oats reduced the number of root lesion nematodes but did not affect root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. In contrast, Garry oats reduced root colonization by Rhizoctonia spp. but did not affect the numbers of lesion nematodes. Furthermore, the Saia oat pre-crop increased early berry yield, whereas Garry oats had no significant effect. The yield increase following rotation with Saia oats may have been due to its unsuitability as a host for the lesion nematode, which, in these soils, may have been a more yield-reducing pathogen. In other experiments, we found that Saia oats were similar to Garry oats in reducing R. fragariae recovery from soil (14; J. A. LaMondia, unpublished research). Therefore, the failure of Garry oats to affect yield may be attributed to its high susceptibility to the lesion nematode. The resistance of Saia oats to the lesion nematode was first recognized by Colbran (3), who noted its utility in suppressing re-plant problems in apple orchards. Townsend (24) later demonstrated that Saia oats were resistant to Pratylenchus neglectus Rensch and P. penetrans. However, the resistance to the lesion nematode does not entirely explain the effects of Saia oats on disease and yield, as sorgho-sudangrass also reduced lesion nematodes but had no significant impact on disease severity or yield. The reduction in nematode densities by sorgho-sudangrass may have been insufficient to affect yield. Additionally, it is possible that oat straw residues have specific effects on the disease. Papavizas (18) reported that oat (presumably A. sativa) straw residues increased the number of antagonistic bacteria to R. solani and other fungal pathogens in soil. Since we did not examine antagonism, it is unclear whether the residues of Avena spp. act differently toward soil microbes compared to those of sorgho-sudangrass.', 0.10330899059772491]]\nContext 9: [['Nicholson, R.L., Moraes, W.C. 1980.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9883072972297668]]\nContext 1: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.20357108116149902]]\n"

With citrus postbloom fruit drop, the infection strategy on leaves is presumably biotrophic. After the end of the bloom period, conidia germinate to form appressoria, establishing quiescent infections that are likely intracellular (6, 92). The tissues where quiescent infections develop are never colonized, and necrotrophy does not occur on leaves; rather, conidia and secondary conidia are produced following the germination of the appressorium on the surface. However, on flower petals, the pathogen behaves as a necrotroph. For key lime and strawberries, the biotrophic phase is very short. The pathogen produces appressoria, penetrates the host, and forms a subcuticular intramural necrotrophic association almost immediately (16). Curry et al. (16) regarded this strategy as a modification of necrotrophy rather than bio- or hemibiotrophy due to the brief biotrophic phase.', 0.14374364912509918]]\nContext 5: [['Pathogenicity tests conducted by MacKenzie et al.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al. (1994).', 0.9339419603347778]]\nContext 1: [['In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).', 0.9128637313842773]]\nContext 2: [['The genus Colletotrichum is considered one of the top ten important genera of fungal pathogens globally (Dean et al., 2012). Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5101475119590759]]\nContext 2: [['Madden, L.V., Wilson, L.L., Ellis, M.A. 1993.

However, some recently described species (Diao et al. 2017; Marin-Felix et al. 2017) could not be placed within the ApMat and gs phylogenetic trees due to the absence of ApMat gene sequence data. Although previous reports indicated that the gs gene alone is not a reliable marker for differentiating C. siamense isolates (Weir et al. 2012), our data showed multiple base pair differences in the gene sequences of the gs loci of C. siamense, similar to those observed in the ApMat locus. Additionally, the lack of noticeable subclading in C. siamense in the 5-gene tree, compared to the ApMat and gs tree, confirmed that the ApMat and gs loci are more informative than the other five gene loci. The ApMat gene has been shown to enhance the systematics of the Gloeosporioides species complex, providing complementary phylogenetic information compared to other loci (Silva et al. 2012). Liu et al.

However, not all terminal clades are recognized as named species. In most cases, any well-supported within-species phylogenetic structure evident in the multigene phylogeny is not resolved consistently across all gene trees. This lack of congruence between gene trees indicates that the diversity being sampled is below the species level, according to the logic of the genealogical concordance phylogenetic species recognition (GCPSR) concept (Taylor et al. 2000). Although concatenating gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it can mask discordance between individual gene phylogenies. An alternative method, using a species-tree approach (Figs. 3, 4B, 5B), combines multi-gene data from multiple isolates hypothesized to represent a single species, allowing for the estimation of the evolutionary history of the species rather than that of individual isolates. Fig. 3 shows the results of such an analysis for the C. gloeosporioides complex, while Figs. 4B and 5B illustrate relationships within the Musae and Kahawae clades, respectively, at an expanded scale. Posterior probabilities for some of the speciation events are low, particularly within the Musae and Kahawae clades. This may be because, while species-tree algorithms account for incomplete lineage sorting (Heled & Drummond 2010, Chung & An\u00e9 2011), most do not compensate for horizontal gene transfer, reassortment, or introgression. Hybridization could also result in discordant gene phylogenies. Hybrids are known in the C. acutatum complex, such as Glomerella acutata, a hybrid formed by crossing C. acutatum and C. fioriniae strains in the laboratory, as well as a putative hybrid strain collected from terminal crook disease on Pinus in New Zealand, where both species coexist in nature (Damm et al. 2012a, this issue).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.6250969171524048]]\nContext 1: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel.

Similarly, strawberry and anemone cultivated in close proximity in Israel were found to be infected by an identical genotype of C. acutatum.', 0.9956938028335571]]\nContext 3: [['The epiphytic behavior of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage may play a critical role in the strawberry anthracnose disease cycle. Recent studies have shown that C. acutatum can produce secondary conidia on strawberry leaves without visible symptom development and can persist on symptomless foliage of strawberries and weeds for several weeks. As a result, symptomless leaves may act as a source of inoculum for strawberry anthracnose. Similarly, symptomless foliage of tomato and citrus has been reported to provide inoculum for diseases caused by C. coccodes and C. acutatum, respectively.', 0.9917028546333313]]\nContext 4: [['Four C. acutatum isolates from fruits and roots were used to inoculate the foliage and roots of strawberry plants to determine whether symptom development could be affected by the source of the isolate. The tested isolates, regardless of their origin, caused typical anthracnose symptoms on petioles, leaves, and stolons of both Chandler and Sharon cultivars 7 to 10 days after inoculation. After 30 days, 100% mortality was observed in all foliar-inoculated plants, compared to 0% mortality in the water control plants, which remained healthy thereafter.', 0.9910605549812317]]\nContext 5: [['Colletotrichum acutatum isolates were obtained from anemone, apple, and peach, infecting detached fruit including two cultivars of apple, avocado, almond, mango, and nectarine. These results demonstrated the cross-infection potential of two species, C. gloeosporioides (including representatives from distinct subpopulations in almond, apple, avocado, and mango) and C. acutatum (from apple and peach), affecting several fruit species. C. acutatum is a known pathogen of the ornamental anemone, causing leaf curl disease. In cross-inoculation experiments involving anemone and strawberry, regardless of the isolate source (anemone or strawberry), all anemone plants died within 14 days of inoculation. Typical anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberry plants artificially inoculated with isolates from both hosts, leading to eventual mortality.', 0.9903731346130371]]\nContext 6: [['Colletotrichum acutatum is particularly significant in Europe, where it is subject to statutory quarantine requirements. Symptoms manifest on various parts of the plant, especially on stolons, flowers, and fruits. Currently, there are no effective chemical control methods available. Cultural techniques, such as drip irrigation and cultivation under plastic tunnels, significantly limit the dispersal of inoculum, thereby reducing fruit losses. Utilizing pathogen-free plants produced through certification schemes can provide a level of disease control; however, latent infections in apparently healthy plants can still lead to anthracnose losses in production fields. Thus, developing strawberry cultivars resistant to C. acutatum is a promising approach for managing anthracnose, offering an economical and environmentally friendly solution. Screening methods evaluating the overall plant reaction have identified accessions resistant to C. acutatum within F. \u00d7 ananassa. Previous studies on the inheritance of anthracnose resistance have described various modes of resistance. Research by Denoyes and Baudry has suggested that resistance to C. acutatum may exhibit different inheritance modes, depending on the pathogenicity group of the isolate and the resistance level.', 0.9894184470176697]]\nContext 7: [['The greatest economic losses due to anthracnose in strawberries are attributed to fruit rot caused by C. acutatum, which also infects many other fruit and vegetable crops, including apples, tomatoes, peppers, peaches, blueberries, blackberries, and grapes (Bernstein et al., 1995; Howard et al., 1992; Smith, 2002). The presence of the pathogen has been reported on strawberries in nearly all areas where they are grown. Crown infections of strawberry plants by C. acutatum often result in stunted plants rather than death. Infected plants typically do not thrive after transplantation and yield few berries at harvest.', 0.9781620502471924]]\nContext 8: [['Although C. acutatum survives in soil, on plant debris, and in fumigated field soil, it is assumed that the main source of inoculum usually originates from infected strawberry plant material from the nursery. However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum. Further investigation is needed to understand the contribution of inoculum from such plants to the development of anthracnose disease in strawberries under field conditions and in the dispersal of the pathogen from season to season.', 0.9724993109703064]]\nContext 9: [['This study provides strong evidence that C. acutatum can become established, persist, and produce inoculum on symptomless strawberry leaves under a range of temperatures and intermittent wetness periods. In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.', 0.971831202507019]]\n"

Early symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) include blackening of specific tissues of the strawberry. These symptoms progress with the enlargement of lesions, which hinder proper fruit development and lead to the formation of orange-colored spores within the lesions. Similar symptoms were noted on the petioles, with sunken and blackened tissues similar to those on the fruit, accompanied by the formation of an orange conidial mass.', 0.9938898086547852]]\nContext 1: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.', 0.9769895076751709]]\nContext 2: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.9696232080459595]]\nContext 3: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.', 0.9668363928794861]]\nContext 4: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9573349356651306]]\nContext 5: [['Smith, B.

During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy.

These variations are often observed in strains that have been repeatedly subcultured, as well as in the \u201cterminal crook\u201d disease of pine (Dingley & Gilmour 1972) and in the anthracnose affecting leather leaf fern (Schiller et al. 2006). There are also reports of disseminated infections in sea turtles (Manire et al. 2002) and infections in scale insects (Marcelino et al. 2008). Differentiating between C. acutatum (s. lat.) and C. gloeosporioides (s. lat.) is challenging due to the existence of many intermediate strains that exhibit a limited number of typical fusiform conidia alongside numerous cylindrical ones (Van der Aa et al. 1990).', 0.957663357257843]]\nContext 2: [['Morphology of C. acutatum. C. acutatum is an Ascomycete classified in the Pyrenomycetes and included in the family Phyllachoraceae. Colonies of C. acutatum are usually white initially but later become covered with pink to orange conidial masses. Cultures from certain hosts are highly chromogenic and excrete red and pink pigments into the culture media. The primary production of conidia occurs in acervuli; however, C. acutatum can also form secondary conidia on the surfaces of living leaves. Conidia are typically ellipsoid and fusiform at least at one end, differing from C. gloeosporioides, which generally has both ends rounded. Setae are usually sparse or not produced at all. Pigmented appressoria form upon germination of the conidia and vary in shape and size.', 0.9156555533409119]]\nContext 3: [['Recently, more focus has been placed on conidium morphology, particularly shape and dimensions. The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

The former was not separated morphologically from C. acutatum, being designated primarily based on its pathogenicity to pines. C. acutatum f. sp. chromogenum was distinguished based on pink and red pigments in the agar medium during culture.

The tissues on which sporulation and reproduction occur differ among various hosts, and the fate of appressoria and quiescent infections varies greatly.

Although concatenating gene sequences is a convenient way to present multigene data, it can mask discordance between individual gene phylogenies.

Outbreaks of anthracnose in strawberry nurseries and fields have caused yield losses of up to 50-80%. This study demonstrated the diversity of pathogenic Colletotrichum species associated with strawberry in Taiwan. The findings provide precise information about pathogen identity, which is valuable for screening resistant varieties and developing effective disease management strategies. Regardless of whether inoculated on wounded or non-wounded leaves, the predominant pathogen C. siamense caused larger lesions at 30\u00b0C than at 25\u00b0C, which is significant in subtropical Taiwan and similar areas. No significant difference was observed between the mycelial growth rates of C. siamense at 25\u00b0C, 28\u00b0C, and 30\u00b0C; hence, the higher disease severity at 30\u00b0C may be due to reduced resistance of strawberry plants to anthracnose at elevated temperatures. In Taiwan, the susceptible cultivar Taoyuan No. 1 has been widely cultivated for over 30 years. Developing temperature-independent resistant cultivars will be crucial for strawberry breeding programs in Taiwan and other tropical and subtropical regions. Future work will focus on monitoring pathogen population changes, investigating fungicide sensitivity levels of different Colletotrichum species, and developing molecular detection methods to assist in producing strawberry seedlings free of latent infection by major Colletotrichum species.', 0.9839682579040527]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.7073221206665039]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.6388095617294312]]\nContext 3: [['From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.', 0.2967980206012726]]\nContext 4: [['Madden, L.V., Wilson, L.L., Ellis, M.A. 1993.

One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9613747596740723]]\nContext 1: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit.

Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.9549893140792847]]\nContext 2: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel.

This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.929736316204071]]\nContext 1: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.', 0.8423389792442322]]\nContext 2: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.758719265460968]]\nContext 3: [['In November 2021, anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberries (cv.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.903980016708374]]\nContext 1: [['Hu, D.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.9814003705978394]]\nContext 2: [['This review focuses on current research into the infection process of Colletotrichum species, with an overall emphasis on how signal transduction influences pre-penetration morphogenesis, including conidiation, conidial attachment, conidial germination, germ tube formation, and appressorial differentiation.

It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex.

Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.989942193031311]]\nContext 1: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide.

Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.', 0.6428065896034241]]\nContext 1: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.6316460967063904]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberries (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally. Notably, over 100 fungal species can invade strawberry plants, with approximately one-third causing serious diseases on different plant parts (Martin and others).', 0.40211260318756104]]\nContext 3: [['Species of the fungal plant pathogen Colletotrichum are responsible for strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa Duch.) anthracnose, one of the major diseases affecting this crop. Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.40136852860450745]]\nContext 4: [['De los Santos, B., de Paredes, G., and Munoz, F.

In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada. The use of transplants from northern nurseries is crucial to avoid anthracnose disease issues and to ensure that plants have undergone sufficient natural chilling to induce floral bud initiation.', 0.3596402704715729]]\nContext 6: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.3565032184123993]]\nContext 7: [['De los Santos, B., de Paredes, G., and Munoz, F.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5623323917388916]]\nContext 1: [['As our knowledge of the anthracnose pathogens and the epidemiology of anthracnose diseases has increased, so has our ability to control these diseases.

In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

To develop a semiselective medium suitable for both controlled environments and field samples, a selective marker was necessary.

Induced resistance to benomyl is believed to arise from a single gene mutation and is easily induced and stable. However, some consider the resistance of C. acutatum to benomyl to be natural rather than the result of selection pressure.

CABI database records from 1978 to 1983 show the incidence of the pathogen on various hosts and in different UK locations. However, it seems improbable that the initial outbreak on strawberries led to widespread dispersal of the pathogen.

We found that strains from this host belong to six different clades within the C. acutatum species complex: C. simmondsii (three strains from Australia), C. nymphaeae (38 strains, mostly from Europe and the USA), C. fioriniae (seven strains from New Zealand, the UK, and the USA), C. godetiae (10 strains, all from Europe), C. acutatum s. str. (one strain from Australia), and C. salicis (four strains from New Zealand). A study by MacKenzie et al. (2009) demonstrated that strains from strawberry were more aggressive to strawberry than strains from Vaccinium. Based on TUB2 sequences generated by those authors, the strains from strawberry were assigned to C. nymphaeae, while the strains from Vaccinium were assigned to C. fioriniae. The apparent differences in pathogenicity may not stem from the different hosts but rather from the fact that the strains studied belong to different species. To our knowledge, C. acutatum s. str. has rarely been found in Europe, and then mostly on ornamental plants. So far, it has only been isolated from strawberry in Australia. In pathogenicity tests by Talhinhas et al. (2005), an isolate of C. acutatum s. str. from olive caused anthracnose symptoms on strawberry fruits; its virulence was comparable to that of group A2 (C. nymphaeae and related species), A3 (C. fioriniae), or A4 (C. godetiae). If further quarantine regulation is to be implemented, beyond the generalized prohibition of contamination by any members of the C. acutatum species complex, more rigorous diagnostic methods will be needed.', 0.9232731461524963]]\nContext 5: [['The results from this study, along with previous research, may explain the increasing significance of C. acutatum in northern regions (15, 20). Once introduced in an area, C. acutatum could possess distinct advantages over other strawberry-infecting species of Colletotrichum at cooler temperatures, which are typical for northern climates. Two of these advantages include a shorter latent period for C. acutatum and a greater production of spores at lower temperatures.', 0.8184517025947571]]\nContext 6: [['Based on four sequence loci (ITS, TUB, GAPDH, and MAT1-2), the Colletotrichum acutatum sensu lato isolates were assigned to three newly designated species: C. nymphaeae, C. godetiae, and C. fioriniae, following a recent taxonomic re-assessment [18]. According to available literature, C. nymphaeae is the most common species, while C. godetiae is also frequently reported in European and American strawberry fields [6]. These two species were the most representative in our dataset of isolates related to strawberries in the UK.

The conidia are formed in acervuli on the host, while in culture, they can also be produced in the aerial mycelium (Johnston & Jones 1997). C. acutatum has been observed to form secondary conidia on living strawberry leaves, stimulated by extracts from the strawberry plant, especially flower extracts (Leandro et al. 2001; Leandro et al. 2003). According to Buddie et al. (1999), secondary conidia may be produced directly from germinating primary conidia, and these are generally smaller and more variable in shape, which can obscure the differences between taxa.

The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.', 0.5733811259269714]]\nContext 9: [['C. acutatum was first described as a separate species by Simmonds. Many isolates now identified as C. acutatum were either classified under C. gloeosporioides or considered species of Gloeo sporium.

For instance, strawberries can be affected by C. acutatum, C. gloeosporioides, and C. fragariae. The latter two typically cause petiole and stolon lesions, as well as crown rot on strawberries.', 0.5561544299125671]]\n"

A yellow isolate, similar to the one produced by G. cingulata, is occasionally obtained, although this is not found in field isolates.

The size and shape of the appressoria formed by the species discussed here were briefly investigated, but the differences did not appear to be sufficient to warrant a more detailed examination. The mean length of the appressoria mostly ranged between 8 and 9 \u00b5m, with a mean breadth between 6.0 and 6.5 \u00b5m. The appressoria of C. atramentarium were somewhat larger, with a mean length of 11.3 \u00b5m, while those of C. musae were shorter, averaging 7.7 \u00b5m.

It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex.

Schrenk), which is considered a cumulative species and forms the sexual stage in some instances, is predominantly found as a postharvest disease affecting fruits such as avocado and mango. Strawberry may be infected by three Colletotrichum species: C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, causing anthracnose of fruit and other plant parts. Similarly, C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds has been reported to infect a large number of fruit crops, including avocado, strawberry, almond, apple, and peach. Citrus can be affected by four different Colletotrichum diseases: postbloom fruit drop and key lime anthracnose, both caused by C. acutatum, as well as shoot dieback and leaf spot, and postharvest fruit decay, both caused by C. gloeosporioides.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.5494120121002197]]\nContext 4: [['Many species belonging to the genus Colletotrichum are associated with plant diseases, commonly referred to as anthracnose.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae.

Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9977514147758484]]\nContext 1: [['The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum.

The Mediterranean countries rank second only to China in fruit production and are the largest fruit exporters after South Africa (FAO 2016). Therefore, understanding all pathogens affecting this crop is imperative. The current study aimed to investigate the major citrus production areas in Europe through large-scale sampling and to identify isolates using a polyphasic approach. This method revealed many cryptic and new Colletotrichum species associated with citrus, classified into four modern taxonomic species complexes. Surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 across commercial nurseries, orchards, gardens, and plant collections aimed to determine the occurrence of Colletotrichum spp. related to citrus and allied genera (Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, Poncirus). The study's specific objectives included conducting extensive sampling of fresh plant materials, cultivating Colletotrichum isolates, subjecting these isolates to DNA sequence analyses alongside morphological characterization, comparing results with other phylogenetic studies, and evaluating the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species on citrus fruit. Major diseases of citrus caused by Colletotrichum species include postbloom fruit drop (PFD), petal necrosis, and key lime anthracnose (KLA), with C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides being significant agents.

Several species are notably problematic for citrus, causing pre- and post-harvest infections such as anthracnose, postbloom fruit drop, tear stain, and stem-end rot, as well as wither-tip on twigs. This study utilized multi-locus sequence typing to investigate the occurrence, diversity, and pathogenicity of Colletotrichum spp. associated with citrus and allied genera in European orchards, nurseries, and gardens. Surveys were conducted in Greece, Italy, Malta, Portugal, and Spain during 2015 and 2016, resulting in the isolation of 174 Colletotrichum strains from symptomatic leaves, fruits, petals, and twigs. A multi-locus phylogeny was constructed based on seven genomic loci (ITS, GAPDH, ACT, CAL, CHS-1, HIS3, and TUB2), and the morphological characteristics of the isolates were assessed. Preliminary pathogenicity tests were performed on orange fruits using representative isolates. The Colletotrichum strains were classified into three major species complexes. Within the C. gloeosporioides species complex, C. gloeosporioides s.str., and two novel species (C. helleniense and C. hystricis) were identified. In the C. boninense species complex, C. karstii, C. novae-zelandiae, and two novel species (C. catinaense and C. limonicola) were noted, while C. acutatum s.str. was identified as a member of the C. acutatum species complex.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

The disease cycles of anthracnose on different hosts exhibit similar components (Peres et al., 2005; De Silva et al., 2017); they are typically polycyclic, with splash-borne asexual spores (conidia) initiating and spreading epidemics. Other Colletotrichum-related diseases include crown rot in strawberries and black dot disease on the roots of tomatoes and potatoes (Dillard and Cobb, 1997; Dillard and Cobb, 1998; Waller et al., 2002). Additionally, Colletotrichum species can cause post-harvest diseases, particularly in avocado, almond, and citrus fruits (Prusky, 1996; Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). In these cases, the pathogens form infection structures (appressoria) on the host but remain dormant within the fruit until after harvest, during which symptoms may emerge (Ismail and Zhang, 2004; Prusky et al., 2013). Several studies have indicated that species within a clade exhibit similar colonization and infection behaviors, with the establishment of quiescence being host- and tissue-specific (Sanders and Korsten, 2003; Damm et al., 2012; Weir et al., 2012; Prusky et al., 2013; Jayawardena et al., 2016; Zakaria, 2021). Furthermore, species within clades have comparable temperature requirements for mycelial growth, conidial germination, infection, and spore production (Salotti et al., 2022). For example, species such as C. gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, C. gossypii, and C. musaebelonging to the gloeosporioides clade show optimum temperatures for mycelial growth, sporulation, conidial germination, and infection between 25 and 32\u00b0C (Salotti et al., 2022).', 0.9926034808158875]]\nContext 2: [['Abstract: In tropical fruit crops, anthracnose is primarily caused by species of the fungal genus Colletotrichum. These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial.

Each collection was assigned a separate name at the forma rank, as listed above. Although no forma orchidearum was officially named, that designation comes into effect upon the description of the other forms (Art. 26). The species account included a description of the overall taxon and compared it with C. macrosporum, another orchid species described by Saccardo (1896) from a Brazilian collection. Saccardo noted that C. macrosporum has substantially larger conidia than those of C. orchidearum (measurements of 28\u201332 \u00d7 8\u201310 \u00b5m were reported), and its relationships remain unknown.

While the dicot clade did not exhibit any clear substructure linked to host specificity, the monocot clade comprised three subclades: one was restricted to Orchidaceae, while the other two contained strains from Crinum (Amaryllidaceae). The dicot clade corresponds to C. karstii, as recognized in this paper, whereas the monocot clade includes C. boninense s. str. Our research does not support this division. Although C. karstii is found on a variety of dicots, it has also been observed on Orchidaceae and other monocots, particularly Musa spp. Among the other segregate species we recognize, C. dracaenae and C. hippeastri appear to be specific at the host genus level, though the number of strains we have examined remains insufficient to confirm this.', 0.22593340277671814]]\nContext 4: [['MycoBank MB563594.

The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods.

However, in nurseries or production fields, the pathogen may be introduced through contaminated soil, on field equipment, or may be splash-dispersed or blown in from surrounding vegetation that may carry the fungus without visible symptoms. This work has shown that C. acutatum from strawberries can survive and colonize many other plant species under controlled greenhouse conditions without causing disease, exhibiting epiphytic, endophytic, and non-pathogenic lifestyles. These findings emphasize that various crop plants, including weeds, may serve as potential inoculum sources of C. acutatum.

In addition to our previous work at 26\u00b0C under continuous wetness (19), we have now shown that secondary conidia and appressoria may be produced under environmental conditions typical of many temperate strawberry-producing areas in the world. The survival of C. acutatum on strawberry leaves has implications for long-distance dissemination on transplants, as well as the proliferation and dissemination of the fungus within production fields. Furthermore, asymptomatic foliage of other plant species, including weeds, has been recently suggested as an additional inoculum source for C. acutatum (12). The environmental biology of C. acutatum on symptomless foliage should therefore be considered when developing management practices for strawberry anthracnose.', 0.9430227279663086]]\nContext 7: [['The role of alternative hosts in the disease cycles caused by C. acutatum is also not well understood. The fungus can infect both anemones and strawberries, suggesting potential spread between these crops. Research has shown that C. acutatum is capable of colonizing surrounding weeds, such as Vicia spp. and Conyza spp., and can survive for three months on the leaves of tomatoes, peppers, and eggplants. This indicates that the pathogen could spread from strawberries to adjacent weeds and then reinfest new strawberry fields in subsequent years. Molecular and vegetative compatibility studies have indicated that isolates from weeds, anemones, and strawberries form a single population in Israel. Further studies demonstrated that while C. acutatum initially fails to penetrate the tissues of peppers, eggplants, and tomatoes, intercellular penetration occurs later, suggesting the fungus may live as an endophyte on these hosts.', 0.7940136194229126]]\nContext 8: [['The ability of flower extracts to stimulate C. acutatum conidiation decreased with increasing durations of dry periods, possibly due to rising fungal mortality over time.

The fact that C. acutatum could be stimulated to multiply on coverslips and leaves even after two weeks of exposure to dry conditions clearly indicates the durability of C. acutatum propagules and demonstrates that survival does not depend on the presence of a host.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9914091229438782]]\nContext 1: [['Introduction: The spread of strawberry anthracnose can be exacerbated by the use of infected runner plantlets (Hirayama et al. 2010).

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.7361765503883362]]\nContext 3: [['Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%.

Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose.

Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants.

Fungicides are used to control anthracnose diseases; however, several have become ineffective due to the development of fungicide-resistant strains of the pathogens. Field observations in Florida indicated that growing strawberry plants in soils with low N levels reduced the severity of anthracnose, although this also severely limited fruit production. Both the form of nitrogen and calcium levels influence disease severity. For instance, calcium has been employed to manage soil-borne diseases caused by Pythium spp. on various crops, while nitrate forms of N have been shown to suppress Fusarium wilt in tomatoes, whereas ammonium forms increase disease severity.', 0.9477487802505493]]\nContext 1: [['Strawberry anthracnose, caused mainly by the Colletotrichum acutatum species complex, is a significant disease affecting strawberry production.

Resistance to QoIs was first reported in Florida in 2013, and subsequent anthracnose outbreaks occurred in strawberry nurseries and production fields throughout the U.S. in 2015. Fungicide use surveys indicated that, in certain locations, the number of QoI applications exceeded the recommended levels for this fungicide group.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.8426498770713806]]\nContext 2: [['The genus Colletotrichum is considered one of the top ten important genera of fungal pathogens globally (Dean et al., 2012).

Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020). Currently, a total of 257 Colletotrichum species grouped into 15 complexes and 13 additional singletons have been accepted in this genus.', 0.7638399600982666]]\nContext 3: [['Bernstein B, Zehr EI, Dean RA, et al. 1995.

These phytopathogens can infect various parts of the fruit crops; however, infections occurring during postharvest or ripening stages lead to significant economic losses. The disease manifests as black to dark brown sunken lesions on the fruit surface, which diminishes fruit quality and marketability. Common tropical fruit crops susceptible to anthracnose include mango, papaya, banana, avocado, guava, and dragon fruit, all of which are economically important in many developing countries. It is essential to note that newly identified Colletotrichum species associated with fruit anthracnose can infect multiple hosts, though some species may exhibit host specificity. Utilizing multiple markers, many phylogenetic species of Colletotrichum have been recognized as anthracnose-causing pathogens. Given that effective disease management strategies depend on a comprehensive understanding of the causative agents, up-to-date information regarding Colletotrichum species and the risks posed by newly identified species in tropical fruit plantations and harvested fruits is crucial. Furthermore, these newly recorded species may be significant for biosecurity and should be classified as quarantine pathogens, particularly as tropical fruits are traded globally.', 0.11473361402750015]]\nContext 8: [['Bieysse, D., Bella Manga, D., Mouen Bedimo, J.

Conidia were recovered from all plants over a 2- to 3-month period, regardless of whether overhead or drip irrigation was used (see Fig. 2). The number of conidia recovered from strawberry was comparable to that from the other plants at all time points and, in most cases, the differences were not significant (P < 0.05) across the different plant species, although disease symptoms were observed only on the strawberry plants. Significant numbers of conidia were still recovered from the plants at the end of the experiment, indicating that the survival potential of the fungus on all plant species exceeded 3 months.', 0.9918012022972107]]\nContext 1: [['In Israel, inoculation of isolates of C. acutatum from anemone and strawberry into each host resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms on both plant species. Molecular studies indicated that the isolates from the two hosts were similar and formed a single genetic subgroup. Isolates of C. acutatum were recovered from pepper, eggplant, tomato, bean, as well as from weeds of the genera Vicia and Conyza; however, disease symptoms occurred only on strawberry. C. acutatum isolates from tulip tree in Argentina were also pathogenic to strawberry fruit. Thus, strawberry isolates of C. acutatum can parasitize and cause disease on other hosts or, alternatively, survive on other crops and weeds without producing symptoms.', 0.9847676157951355]]\nContext 2: [['In strawberries, C. acutatum is typically introduced into production fields from nurseries. While some plants may exhibit symptoms, often the pathogen is introduced through asymptomatic leaves or petioles, likely as appressoria or quiescent infections. It remains unclear whether quiescent infections develop into lesions or if appressoria germinate to produce conidia. However, conidia of C. acutatum can generate several secondary conidia from each deposited conidium on the leaf surface. This suggests that the fungus is reproducing by utilizing nutrients on the leaf surface rather than relying on reserves from the original conidium. In these instances, it appears that the fungus is growing as an epiphyte rather than producing quiescent infections.', 0.9522066116333008]]\nContext 3: [['In inoculations conducted under controlled greenhouse conditions, C. acutatum from strawberry was isolated from inoculated plants that did not exhibit disease symptoms but maintained virulence on strawberry. The fungus was detected by a plating method both on and inside inoculated leaves at various time points after plant inoculation. The authenticity of the isolates as C. acutatum was validated by PCR using C. acutatum-specific primers. The PCR technique proved accurate and sensitive enough to detect the pathogen in inoculated tissues within 24 hours post-inoculation. This method is valuable for detecting C. acutatum in the tissues of various plant species, indicating that the fungus can exhibit both epiphytic and endophytic lifestyles without causing visible disease symptoms. PCR and fungal isolation data indicate that the pathogen can remain viable for extended periods within the tissues of various plant species without inducing disease symptoms. Although the experiments were concluded after three months for technical reasons, the final levels of inoculum in the examined tissues and the decay curves suggest that the pathogen had the potential to inhabit the infected plants for much longer periods.

Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms.

Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973).

Ideally, one of the seven protein-coding genes used in this study could be proposed as a secondary barcode for accurately identifying species within the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex. A preliminary analysis of the performance of these genes as barcodes was conducted as part of Cai et al. (2009), where GAPDH, CAL, and ACT performed well, while CHS-1, ITS, and TEF (EF1\u03b1) performed poorly. However, the analysis by Cai et al.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.3247561752796173]]\nContext 1: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014). The delineation of Colletotrichum species and the description of new species continue to progress with the advent of novel technologies such as whole genome sequencing (Jayawardena et al., 2020, 2021; Bhunjun et al., 2021; Talhinhas and Baroncelli, 2021).', 0.3010255992412567]]\nContext 2: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.2379348874092102]]\nContext 3: [['Strawberries (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit.

More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.', 0.9794124364852905]]\nContext 1: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel. Following transplantation to production fields during September and October, entire beds of strawberry plants collapsed. Typical anthracnose symptoms observed from November 1995 to June 1996 included crown rot, flower blight, and green and ripe fruit rot. This marked the first record of strawberry anthracnose in Israel. Furthermore, in at least four production fields in the same region, hundreds of plants developed symptoms of stunting and chlorosis, which are atypical of strawberry anthracnose. When these plants were uprooted, most of their roots were dark brown and decayed. Colletotrichum was readily isolated from these samples.', 0.9708296656608582]]\nContext 2: [['In November 2021, anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberries (cv. Kingsberry) in Nonsan, Chungnam Province. Early symptoms of anthracnose fruit rot (AFR) include blackening of specific tissues of the strawberry. These symptoms progress with the enlargement of lesions, which hinder proper fruit development and lead to the formation of orange-colored spores within the lesions. Similar symptoms were noted on the petioles, with sunken and blackened tissues similar to those on the fruit, accompanied by the formation of an orange conidial mass.', 0.9541082978248596]]\nContext 3: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.', 0.9209602475166321]]\nContext 4: [['Strawberry anthracnose can affect plants at any lifecycle stage, but plants are particularly susceptible at the seedling stage and immediately after planting (Wang et al. 2008). The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010).

Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the primary inoculum that initiates epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appressoria, and then penetrate the epidermal cells. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, resulting in black or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrotic lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, as well as wilting of the entire plant due to crown rot. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues.

Major species that cause strawberry anthracnose include C. acutatum J.H. Simmons, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. Symptoms of the disease manifest in various phases. Infection of mother plants with anthracnose may result in the collapse of the entire plant due to crown rot. In the nursery, lesions form on stolons that eventually girdle the runners, leading to wilting and death of unrooted daughter plants distal to the lesion. Death of daughter plants in the nursery and in field transplants can also be caused by crown rot. Infected transplants are capable of spreading the disease from the nursery to the field, and entire crops can be destroyed by anthracnose in strawberry fruit production fields under conducive environmental conditions.', 0.6578093767166138]]\nContext 8: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Further alignment of sequences was achieved using default settings in MAFFT v.7 (Katoh & Toh, 2008, http://mafft.cbrc.jp/alignment/server/), and manual adjustments were made using BioEdit v.7.0.9.0 (Hall, 1999) where necessary. Two separate phylogenetic trees were constructed: one for the acutatum species complex and another for the gloeosporioides species complex. Maximum Parsimony analysis (MP) was performed using PAUP v. 4.0b10 (Swofford, 2002) to obtain the most parsimonious trees. Gaps were treated as missing data, and ambiguously aligned regions were excluded. Trees were inferred using the heuristic search option with Tree Bisection Reconnection (TBR) branch swapping and 1,000 random sequence additions.

Descriptive tree statistics for parsimony\u2014Tree Length (TL), Consistency Index (CI), Retention Index (RI), Rescaled Consistency Index (RC), and Homoplasy Index (HI)\u2014were calculated for trees generated under different optimality criteria. The robustness of the most parsimonious trees was evaluated by 1,000 bootstrap replications resulting from the maximum parsimony analysis (Hillis & Bull, 1993). Kishino-Hasegawa tests (KHT) (Kishino & Hasegawa, 1989) were performed to determine whether the trees were significantly different. Bayesian inference (BI) was also employed to construct the phylogenies using MrBayes v.3.1.2 (Ronquist et al., 2003). MrModeltest v.2.3 (Nylander, 2004) was used to select the best-fit model of nucleotide substitution. The HYK+I model was selected for ITS, a HKY+G model for GAPDH and \u03b2-tubulin, a K80+I+G model for CHS-1, and a GTR+G model for ACT were incorporated into the analysis. Six simultaneous Markov chains were run for 1,000,000 generations, and trees were sampled every 100th generation. The 2,000 trees representing the burn-in phase of the analyses were discarded, and the remaining 8,000 trees were used to calculate posterior probabilities (PP) in the majority rule consensus tree.

Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Strawberry (Fragaria \u00d7 ananassa) is a major crop cultivated in China (Xie et al. 2010). The production of strawberries has rapidly expanded in recent years, positioning China as one of the world\u2019s largest producers and exporters. As of 2013, strawberry cultivation covered 100.5 \u00d7 10^3 hectares, yielding 2.8 million tonnes (The Ministry of Agriculture of the People\u2019s Republic of China 2014). However, with increased production, many fungal diseases have emerged as significant challenges, negatively impacting fruit yield and quality (Mass 1998, Smith 2008). Among these, anthracnose, caused by species of Colletotrichum, is one of the most critical diseases affecting strawberries.', 0.9213045835494995]]\nContext 1: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.5342645049095154]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberries (Fragaria\u00d7ananassa Duch.) are a widely cultivated hybrid species within the Rosaceae family, renowned for their fruit. They are increasingly significant for the agricultural economic development of countries like Iran, particularly in the Kurdistan province, which leads in strawberry production, predominantly under open-field conditions (Tehranifar and Sarsaefi, 2002). Various biotic and abiotic factors contribute to the decline in strawberry production globally.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9956489205360413]]\nContext 1: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit.

Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['The combined effects of rotation crops and nitrogen fertilizers were examined on the strawberry black root rot disease complex. In July 1995, microplots were filled with soil that had a history of strawberry black root rot and seeded with two types of oats (Avena strigosa \u2018Saia oats\u2019 or A. sativa \u2018Garry oats\u2019) or with sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor \u00d7 S. sudanense \u2018Triple S\u2019). Microplots planted with 1-year-old \u2018Honeoye\u2019 strawberry crowns served as controls. In May 1996, the crops were chopped and incorporated into the soil. The soil was then replanted with 1-year-old \u2018Honeoye\u2019 strawberry crowns and fertilized with (NH4)2SO4 or Ca(NO3)2 at equivalent nitrogen rates. Two months later, (NH4)2SO4-treated plants exhibited 36% more leaf area and 41% more runners than strawberries treated with Ca(NO3)2. Strawberries that had been precropped with \u2018Saia\u2019 oats produced 135% more runners and 38% more early fruit yield compared to those grown in control microplots. Total fruit yield was not affected by the treatments.', 0.905580461025238]]\nContext 1: [['These results indicate that strawberry growers can adjust their fertilizer practices by opting for Ca(NO3)2 as their N source. This adjustment can help reduce the severity of anthracnose crown rot while ensuring adequate foliar N levels necessary for optimal growth and production. As anticipated, foliar N levels increased with higher treatment N levels, while P and K levels did not influence foliar N.', 0.660485029220581]]\nContext 2: [['The goal of these recommendations is to avoid abiotic stresses, such as drought, winter injury, and heavy wet soils, while employing a two-year rotation with grains. In New England, straw is commonly used as a winter mulch for strawberries, leading many growers to adopt grain rotations to produce straw. However, the effectiveness of rotation crops can vary regarding their susceptibility as hosts to R. fragariae and P. penetrans. Past research has shown that \u2018Saia\u2019 oats (Avena strigosa Schreb.) and \u2018Triple S\u2019 sorgho-sudangrass (Sorghum bicolor \u00d7 S. sudanense) are poor hosts for these pathogens, whereas \u2018Garry\u2019 oats (Avena sativa L), rye (Secale cereale L), buckwheat (Fagopyrum esculentum Moench), canola (Brassica napus L), and strawberries may either increase or have no effect on the population densities of the pathogens. Additionally, studies by Hildebrand and West indicated that strawberry black root rot increased following specific rotation crops, which were associated with elevated levels of both fluorescing and non-fluorescing gram-negative rod bacteria in the strawberry rhizosphere.', 0.6440715193748474]]\nContext 3: [['Compared to Ca(NO3)2, the (NH4)2SO4 treatment reduced the percentage of blackened roots. The influence of the cover crops on growth and disease was more pronounced with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization than with Ca(NO3)2. Combining \u2018Saia\u2019 oats or sorgho-sudangrass rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization led to a reduction in lesion nematode (Pratylenchus penetrans) numbers in subsequent strawberry roots compared to controls. Furthermore, the combination of \u2018Saia\u2019 or \u2018Garry\u2019 oats as a precrop with applications of (NH4)2SO4 reduced black root rot severity relative to controls. Only the \u2018Garry\u2019 oat rotation reduced strawberry root colonization by Rhizoctonia fragariae when compared to controls. Additional effects associated with (NH4)2SO4 treatment included a decrease in rhizosphere soil pH by 0.2 units, a reduction in fluorescent pseudomonads in the rhizosphere by 10- to 15-fold, and leaves with higher concentrations of nitrogen, potassium, sulfur, manganese, and zinc compared to plants treated with Ca(NO3)2. Therefore, rotation with \u2018Saia\u2019 oats combined with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization may suppress strawberry black root rot and enhance yields through multiple effects on the host, pathogens, and associated microflora.', 0.6379991173744202]]\nContext 4: [['Combining Saia oats as a single-season rotation with (NH4)2SO4 fertilization produced larger strawberry plants, more early yield, and less damage from black root rot than if Saia oats were combined with Ca(NO3)2 or if another rotation crop was paired with the (NH4)2SO4 treatment. Rotating strawberries with sorgho-sudangrass and fertilizing with (NH4)2SO4 reduced lesion nematodes but did not affect disease severity or yield.

The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016).

Some fruit diseases caused by the C. acutatum complex have been shown to arise from distinct phylogenetic lineages (Peres et al. 2008), with strawberry fruit rot, in particular, rarely attributed to isolates from heterogeneous hosts (Mackenzie et al. 2009). Cross-infection potential was tested in various studies, including those by Bernstein et al. (1995), Freeman and Shabi (1996), Freeman et al. (2001b), and Mackenzie et al. (2007). Cross-infection may occur both in the field and in laboratory settings (Afanador-Kafuri et al. 2003). Freeman et al. (2001a) found that C. acutatum from strawberry could cause lesions on various fruits, whether they were wounded or intact. In vitro infection studies by Whitelaw-Weckert et al.

The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

This often results in excessive or insufficient watering. Hydroponic technology that considers drainage rates can minimize drainage amounts, thereby reducing environmental pollution and fertilizer consumption. This study compared drainage rates and timed watering methods in a strawberry hydroponic system to determine the optimal drainage rate. As the drainage rate increased, the amount of water supplied also increased. A significantly negative correlation was found between the amount of water supplied and the total nitrogen content. The drainage electrical conductivity (EC) level was highest in the 10% drainage rate group. In the 20% drainage rate treatment, leaf length and width increased compared to the four applications of the timer-supplying method. The yield of fruits weighing more than 27 g was highest in the 20% drainage rate treatment, indicating it was the most appropriate.

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose. Biocontrol agents, such as antagonistic microbes including yeast, bacteria, and filamentous fungi (particularly Trichoderma spp.), have shown promising results and are gaining popularity for their direct application to fruit surfaces post-harvest [143].', 0.9851470589637756]]\nContext 1: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose.

The antifungal antibiotic natamycin, widely used as a natural mold inhibitor in food products, has shown promise in controlling anthracnose root and crown infections caused by C. acutatum on strawberry transplants (Cordova et al. 2017; Haack et al. 2018). Similarly, fluazinam, a single-site respiration inhibitor fungicide from FRAC group 29, has demonstrated significant control of anthracnose fruit rot (Mertely et al. 2018).

Running water effectively removes soil from root and crown tissues, potentially eliminating inoculum, but it does not control any infections already present (Koike et al., 2008). Pre-plant fungicide dips have been shown to decrease anthracnose crown rot; however, only two products are currently registered for this use in the United States. The single-site mode of action quinone outside inhibitor (QoI), azoxystrobin, has been widely used as a preplant dip and as a foliar treatment for managing anthracnose and other fungal diseases (Bartlett et al., 2002; Koike et al., 2008; Turechek et al., 2006). Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9841166138648987]]\nContext 1: [['In the early 1980s, anthracnose became a significant disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9704422950744629]]\nContext 1: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.6715630292892456]]\nContext 2: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.', 0.6072443127632141]]\nContext 3: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide.

The cutinase gene of C. truncatum (CtCut1), a cutin-degrading enzyme, was identified, cloned, and shown to be essential for breaching the cuticle of chili fruit. The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B. The F8-3B-pAA1 transformants exhibited reduced patterns of infection, with one isolate showing a 45.8% reduction in cutinase activity (reduction in CtCut1 transcript) compared to the wild type. Importantly, CtCut1-deficient strains were unable to infect detached chili and soybean hosts as efficiently as the wild type, showing a delay in the infection period. However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin. This research contributes to the understanding of plant-fungal interactions through the development of a fungal transformation system for C. truncatum and the implementation of RNAi technology, which provides an alternative genetic tool for studies of gene function, particularly for essential pathogenicity genes.', 0.9968384504318237]]\nContext 2: [['The infection and colonization by F8-3B-pAA1 transformants on detached chili and soybean hosts were less efficient compared to the wild-type F8-3B, further suggesting the involvement of the gene during pathogenesis.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Colletotrichum spp. often cause anthracnose disease in herbaceous or woody plants in tropical and subtropical regions (Cannon et al. 2012). The genus Colletotrichum is one of the eight major plant pathogens worldwide (Dean et al. 2012). Three species or species complexes of Colletotrichum have been reported to cause anthracnose in strawberries: the Colletotrichum gloeosporioides complex, Colletotrichum fragariae, and the Colletotrichum acutatum complex (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003). The C. gloeosporioides complex is found worldwide and has a wide range of hosts, whereas C. acutatum and C. fragariae have narrower host ranges (MacKenzie et al. 2008). Although a few C. acutatum infections in Chinese strawberries have been reported, the primary species affecting strawberries in China are believed to be C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (Buddie et al. 1999; Han et al. 2016).', 0.9977307915687561]]\nContext 1: [['Colletotrichum is one of the most important genera of plant pathogenic fungi worldwide, causing disease symptoms commonly known as anthracnose on a wide range of important crops, fruits, and ornamental plants (Bailey et al., 1992). Notable species include Colletotrichum lindemuthianum, C. gloeosporioides, C. acutatum, C. falcatum, C. nupharicola, and C. nymphaeae. Some plant pathogenic species are significant for quarantine because they could be introduced into regions where the disease is not present (Farr et al., 2006). The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp). Based on a morphological study, von Arx (1957) included more than 600 synonyms under C. gloeosporioides and 84 synonyms under C. dematium. Sutton (1992) listed 39 accepted species in Colletotrichum, each with a brief description. In recent years, molecular tools have been used to infer the evolutionary relationships of Colletotrichum species. Some species have been segregated from the C. gloeosporioides complex based on nu-rDNA ITS sequence data and morphological characteristics, such as C. boninense.', 0.9973680377006531]]\nContext 2: [[\"Three species have been documented as causal agents of strawberry anthracnose: Colletotrichum gloeosporioides, C. fragariae, and C. acutatum (Denoyes-Rothan et al. 2003).

The genus has recently been recognized as the world's eighth most important group of plant-pathogenic fungi due to its scientific and economic significance (Dean et al. 2012). However, the identification of Colletotrichum spp. has historically been challenging. Single-gene phylogenetic analyses have often failed to accurately delineate species (Hyde et al. 2009). Ko Ko et al. (2011) emphasized the need to resurvey plant pathogens like Colletotrichum spp. using molecular methods, as previous morphological and internal transcribed spacer data are likely to be incorrect.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al.

This pathogen can reproduce on various tissue types across different hosts and can exist as a necrotroph, biotroph, endophyte, or epiphyte, depending on the plant species and tissue involved. The tissues affected are very specific for each host combination, and the pathogen develops a highly specialized relationship at the cellular level that is evident in the disease cycle for each host. Further investigation is needed into the biotrophic and epiphytic phases of the pathogen and the means by which C. acutatum reproduces in the absence of pathogenesis.

In this study, no correlation was found between the genetic grouping and geographical origin of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry. This may be attributed to the large number of C. acutatum isolates from strawberry analyzed in our work. The absence of correlation between genetic grouping and geographical origin suggests that the pathogen may have recently spread worldwide from one or a few sources of origin. Since significant numbers of everbearing strawberry plants were imported from the southwestern United States in the early 1980s (5), the introduction of C. acutatum into Europe may have occurred through contamination of traded plant material. This hypothesis is further supported by the occurrence of North American and European isolates from strawberry that exhibit identical RAPD patterns and ITS sequence data within both subgroups, CA-clonal and CA-variable.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9742398858070374]]\nContext 1: [['De los Santos, B., de Paredes, G., and Munoz, F.

Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised.

Resistance has been reported against this fungicide group in Colletotrichum acutatum populations from strawberries in Florida (Forcelini et al., 2016). During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished).

However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993).

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose.

Later, when anthracnose-infected flowers and fruit may be present, it is recommended to increase the rate of the protectant fungicide to the highest label rate. Warm, rainy weather in early spring often leads to epidemics, during which additional fungicides may be necessary. Growers are encouraged to scout their fields regularly for anthracnose symptoms, such as blighted flowers or black spots on green fruit. If symptoms are detected, the application of a strobilurin fungicide (such as Abound or Cabrio) in conjunction with the protectant fungicide is recommended. During the main bloom period, in late January and early February, fungicides containing two active ingredients (one for anthracnose control and one for Botrytis fruit rot control), such as CaptEvate, Pristine, or Switch, are advised.

This has led to an increased selection rate for QoI-resistant populations as early as the nursery phase.

Colletotrichum spp. often serve as models in studies ranging from pathogenic development and differentiation to plant-microbe interactions. During establishment and colonization of host plants, members of this genus uniquely acquire nutrients via both biotrophy and necrotrophy. Thus, in a single interaction, these fungal pathogens exhibit two modes of nutrient acquisition: initially, nutrients are acquired from living cells, after which a necrotrophic phase is initiated, allowing the same fungus to obtain nutrients from dead cells killed by the fungus. A given species of this genus can exhibit both strategies separately or concurrently. Additionally, these fungi develop a series of specialized infection-related structures, including germ tubes, appressoria, primary intracellular hyphae, and secondary necrotrophic hyphae. Therefore, Colletotrichum species are experimentally attractive organisms for studying the molecular, biochemical, and cellular basis of fungal pathogenicity, development, and signal transduction (see Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Prusky et al., 1999).', 0.3442451059818268]]\nContext 3: [['Before the molecular era, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum species was primarily based on morphological and cultural characteristics, including conidia size and shape, presence or absence of setae, colony color, and growth rate (von Arx 1957; Sutton 1980, 1992).

Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021). The emergence of agricultural cultivation and the intensive disturbance of natural environments have further driven the diversification of Colletotrichum species. These fungi have adapted to thousands of hosts and can be found as endophytes, pathogens, and saprobes (Freeman et al., 1998; Dean et al., 2012; Hirayama et al., 2018; da Silva et al., 2020; Jayawardena et al., 2020).

(3) found that adding phosphite (1.5 to 10 mM) to phosphate-limited Brassica nigra seedlings reduced plant growth. In phosphate-sufficient plants, only the 10 mM phosphite levels caused a reduction. Additionally, while the root-to-shoot ratios of phosphate-stressed plants were typically high (3, 11, 13), phosphite supplementation decreased the root-to-shoot ratio to about 40% of control values. Carswell et al. (3) explained these effects as a disruption of the phosphate-starvation response by phosphonates, causing phosphate-limited plants to behave as though they are phosphorus-sufficient. In our study, root-to-shoot ratios of tomato plants were also significantly lower for phosphorous acid-fertilized plants compared to no-phosphorus plants, indicating similar effects on phosphate metabolism. However, a combined treatment of 1 mM phosphate and 0.3 mM phosphorous acid increased leaf area significantly in two experiments, with a trend for greater leaf dry weight compared to phosphate treatment alone in three experiments. This finding might explain the labeling of commercial phosphite formulations as supplemental fertilizers for improved plant growth and increased crop yield. Additional studies are needed to evaluate possible interactions between phosphite and phosphate fertilizers. Phosphorous acid is readily absorbed by plants and is both xylem- and phloem-mobile (10). Using ion chromatography for quantifying phosphorous acid, Ouimette and Coffey (10) demonstrated that phosphonates are quite stable in avocado plants, persisting in this form for at least several months. Similarly, Robertson and Boyer (12) reported a biological inertness of organic and inorganic phosphites. In our experiments, phosphate concentrations in tomato plants treated with technical phosphite did not differ statistically from those of the no-phosphorus control plants. Phosphate levels in the solutions were not significantly different (P > 0.05) when freshly made or after one week in the recirculating hydroponic system, supporting previous work that molecular oxygen does not readily oxidize phosphonates in aqueous solutions (12). A general trend for higher phosphate levels was observed in the 1.0 mM phosphite solutions compared to the no-phosphorus treatment. In both fresh and aged solutions, measurable phosphate levels in the no-phosphorus and 1 mM phosphite treatments ranged from 0.2 to 0.6 \u00b5g/ml, respectively. Contamination may have occurred from the salts used in the basic nutrient solution. In plants treated with a commercial formulation of phosphite, phosphate concentrations were significantly above those of the no-phosphorus treated plants. This increase could be explained by the slightly elevated phosphate levels in the nutrient solution. Decreased phosphate concentrations in the plant tissue of the 1 mM phosphate/0.3 mM phosphite treated plants compared to the 1 mM phosphate treated plants aligns with previous studies that showed growth of phosphate-sufficient plants in the presence of phosphite resulted in reduced root and leaf phosphate levels (3).

The disease primarily affects strawberry roots, petioles, and stolons, but can also infect flowers and fruit, leading to severe outbreaks (Mertely and Legard 2004). Symptoms include irregular ulcer-like lesions, reddish-brown stolons during initial stolon development, black spindle-shaped lesions on leaves and petioles, wilting, and dead roots (Debode et al. 2009; Freeman and Katan 1997). In Zhejiang, nearly 50% of seedling deaths and over 40% of production losses in nurseries are attributed to this disease (Xie et al. 2010). If environmental conditions are favorable, anthracnose can reduce strawberry yield by up to 80%. Transplants are considered the main source of primary inoculum, but the complete epidemiology of Colletotrichum spp. on strawberries in China remains unclear.', 0.9695910811424255]]\nContext 1: [['From 2010 to 2016, we conducted surveys of anthracnose in strawberries in Miaoli County. More than 50% of diseased plants exhibited symptoms characteristic of anthracnose crown rot (ACR), as described by McInnes et al. (1992). ACR resulted in plant losses of up to 30-40% during the seedling stage and around 20% after transplanting. Initial symptoms in crown tissue included a marbled red and white appearance, which progressed to brown rot and eventual rapid wilting of the plant. Anthracnose symptoms also appeared on other parts of the plant, including leaves, petioles, runners, fruits, and roots. These symptoms manifested as circular black spots on leaves, withering and girdling on runners.', 0.9233709573745728]]\nContext 2: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.721050500869751]]\nContext 3: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.5953360795974731]]\nContext 4: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit.

One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides.

The scientific community has long studied the biomolecular processes regulating this lifestyle, especially those related to the switch from biotrophy to necrotrophy. The species complex has a very wide host range. Meta-analyses have revealed that C. acutatum s.l. strains are associated with infections in hundreds of species from over 90 genera of plants (Magnoliophyta: monocotyledons and dicotyledons, Pinophyta, and Pteridophyta), along with at least two insect species (Dufresne et al., 2000; Thon et al., 2002; Wharton and Di\u00e9guez-Uribeondo, 2004; O\u2019Connell et al., 2012; Marcelino et al., 2008; Mascarin et al., 2016).

The acute conidial ends that contribute to the typical fusiform shape are considered critical morphological features of C. acutatum (Simmonds 1965). However, the name C. acutatum has been applied to various species exhibiting fusiform conidia, many of which are closely related to C. acutatum s. str. Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

Colletotrichum is an ancient fungus that has co-evolved with flowering plants. Plant microfossils of Protocolletotrichum preserved on angiosperm leaf cuticles suggest that the diverse pathogenic strategies of Colletotrichum spp. have been established since the Late Cretaceous period (Kar et al., 2004). Different complexes within the genus may have diverged between 4.8 and 32.2 million years ago (MYA) (Bhunjun et al., 2021).

Sutton (1992) noted that morphology alone does not provide sufficient information for precise identification, especially for species within the C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium complexes. Crouch et al. (2009b) argued that conidial size and shape, along with conidial appressoria, were taxonomically uninformative and of limited use for species diagnosis in graminicolous Colletotrichum species. Species with similar morphological characteristics may exhibit considerable variation at the physiological and pathogenic levels, making this recognition crucial for biosecurity, plant breeding, and integrated disease management. Taxonomy based solely on morphology is likely to result in ambiguity. Recent studies have shown that morphological characters should be used in conjunction with other characters to establish species relationships within Colletotrichum (Crouch et al., 2009b; Prihastuti et al., 2009).', 0.995448887348175]]\nContext 1: [['In a drastic move, von Arx (1957) reduced the number of recognized Colletotrichum species from several hundred to 11 based on morphological characteristics, with many taxa treated as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides and C. dematium. Several additional species have since been accepted based on morphological criteria (Sutton, 1980; 1992). The difficulties in recognizing Colletotrichum species can be attributed to: 1) the limited and variable morphological characters; 2) an extensive host range and variability in pathogenicity (Bailey and Jeger, 1992; Freeman et al., 2000; Latunde-Dada, 2001; Du et al., 2005; Thaung, 2008); 3) type specimens that are often missing or in poor condition, making them unsuitable for molecular studies; and 4) numerous rDNA ITS sequences of Colletotrichum strains in NCBI that are often misidentified (Crouch et al., 2009d; Damm et al., 2009).', 0.9947932362556458]]\nContext 2: [['Despite significant developments over the last ten years, the taxonomy of Colletotrichum is in a state of flux. Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al.

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.756933331489563]]\nContext 1: [['In the early 1980s, anthracnose became a significant disease affecting strawberries in the southeastern United States.

Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.33194583654403687]]\nContext 3: [['Howard CM, Albregts EE. Anthracnose.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al.

In the United States, strawberries were cultivated on nearly 20,000 hectares in 1989, yielding a total production of 555,000 tons valued at $520 million. Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada.

Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.139682799577713]]\nContext 9: [['Howard CM, Albregts EE.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W. Kronstad, ed., Fungal Pathology, 127-148. \u00a9 2000 Kluwer Academic Publishers). For a more complete discussion of this topic, see Sherriff et al.

However, morphological differences alone are insufficient to distinguish between Colletotrichum species due to inherent variations.', 0.9926345944404602]]\nContext 2: [['Available morphological characters of Colletotrichum species include: 1) characters on natural substrates, such as size and shape of conidiomata (acervuli), conidia, conidiophores, and setae; 2) size and shape of conidia, conidiophores, and setae in culture; and 3) size and shape of appressoria. Acervuli, setae, and conidial characters (shape and dimensions) on natural substrates can vary due to environmental factors, and conidia may be absent from infected host tissues. Some Colletotrichum species, such as C. musae and C. gossypii, consistently fail to produce setae in conidiomata (Sutton and Waterston, 1970), and their presence on natural hosts is often inconsistent for species diagnosis (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1966). Morphological characters may vary with environmental factors, and incubation conditions, such as media and temperature, should be standardized (Cannon et al., 2000) for species comparison and identification.

The conidial morphology of C. gloeosporioides and C. lindemuthianum is similar, but their cultural characters are distinctly different. Colletotrichum lindemuthianum produces dark pigmentation in media and grows consistently slower than C. gloeosporioides (Baxter et al., 1983; Sutton, 1992). Likewise, C. musae grows relatively fast, forming effuse colonies and glabrous conidiomata with many conidia, while C. destructivum forms large conidiogenous zones with scattered, relatively short setae and has limited conidial production (Baxter et al., 1983). The shape and size of conidia and appressoria, as well as cultural characteristics, should be evaluated and used with caution, as these traits are highly dependent on growth conditions. Erroneous diagnosis can largely be avoided if morphology is used in conjunction with other characters such as molecular sequence data, biochemical and physiological characteristics, and host range. Crouch et al. (2009b) demonstrated that falcate-spored, grass-associated Colletotrichum species could be distinguished by a combination of molecular data, appressorial morphology, and host range. However, for most Colletotrichum species, host range has not been determined, and available information should be considered with caution, as it is often based on wrongly identified species (Damm et al., 2009).', 0.9867551922798157]]\nContext 4: [['Observations and measurements of conidial size and shape have usually been made using conidial masses mounted in water, cotton blue, or lactic acid (Cannon et al., 2008). It should be noted that many species of Colletotrichum produce secondary conidia in culture directly from germinated primary conidia; these may vary morphologically when compared to those produced in conidiomata (Cannon et al., 2000). Conidial and mycelial appressoria (also referred to as hyphopodia) are often described in Colletotrichum species. Sutton (1980) characterized the mycelial appressoria formed in potato-carrot agar (PCA) using a slide culture technique, while others have used potato dextrose agar (PDA) with incubation in the dark (Johnston and Jones, 1997; Malloch, 1981) or have observed mycelial appressoria formed on the undersurface of SNA cultures (Damm et al., 2009). Conidial appressoria have been recorded when conidia are germinated in drops of deionized water on plastic cover slips in a moist chamber (Johnson et al., 1997; Chaky et al., 2001). Conidial appressoria are taxonomically uninformative and of little use for species diagnosis (Sutton, 1980, 1992). However, Du et al. (2005) noted that the shape of appressoria can differentiate C. acutatum (with rather smooth appressoria) from C. gloeosporioides (with more lobed appressoria). Crouch et al. (2009b) found that appressoria shape and size are useful for delimiting grass-associated Colletotrichum species but should be used in combination with host range. Yang et al. (2009) found that conidial appressoria can distinguish two species of Colletotrichum from Amaryllidaceae. The conidial appressoria of C. hippeastri are larger than those of C. hymenocallidis and are irregular, crenate, or lobed, occasionally becoming complex. In contrast, C. hymenocallidis appressoria are ovate or sometimes clavate.', 0.9866356253623962]]\nContext 5: [['Traditionally, Colletotrichum species have been identified based on morphological characteristics. Taxonomists have utilized several features, including the size and shape of conidia and appressoria, the presence or absence of setae, sclerotia, acervuli, and teleomorph states, as well as cultural characters such as colony color, growth rate, and texture (Simmonds, 1965; Smith and Black, 1990; Sutton, 1992; TeBeest et al., 1997; Photita et al., 2005; Than et al., 2008a-c; Thaung, 2008).

These morphological characteristics have been used in previous studies to delimit species (Damm et al. 2012a, b, 2014; Liu et al. 2013a, 2015; Hou et al. 2016; Guarnaccia et al. 2017).

Crouch et al.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Florida ranks second only to California in the production of fresh-market strawberries. For U.S. winter production (December through March), strawberries are grown on approximately 2,400 hectares. The major cultural problems faced by the Florida strawberry industry include: 1) anthracnose diseases, 2) yearly infestations of the two-spotted spider mite (Tetranychus urticae Koch), and 3) variability in the quality of nursery transplants. Commercial fields are established annually, similar to California practices. Freshly dug transplants are sourced from nurseries in Florida or from northern states and Canada.

The best separability of the species was observed using both GPDH and histone 3 genes, which were superior to ITS, ACT, CHS, and beta-tubulin. The most appropriate gene for barcoding Colletotrichum must be selected during the species delimitation process since we can only choose one or more barcoding genes when we know which taxa need to be distinguished.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.8416844606399536]]\nContext 1: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit.

In the early 1970s, benomyl effectively reduced anthracnose crown rot incidence (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was widely used by strawberry growers for years. However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

Along with commercial products containing only azoxystrobin or pyraclostrobin, premixes with QoI fungicides were also utilized. This has led to an increased selection rate for QoI-resistant populations as early as the nursery phase. Since transplants produced in large nurseries are sold to smaller ones, plants may be exposed to multiple QoI applications throughout each propagation phase.

Many uncertainties exist in the systematics of fungal pathogens from this genus; depending on the taxonomic \"guides,\" the number of species can range from 29 to over 700 (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1992). One of the most confusing species is C. gloeosporioides. For example, 594 species of Colletotrichum were reclassified by von Arx as synonyms of C. gloeosporioides. Identification has primarily relied on morphological characteristics of conidia, vegetative and sexual structures, as well as host specificity and cultural characteristics (von Arx, 1957). Unfortunately, conidial morphology and colony characteristics vary even within isolates. Consequently, classical methods have been supplemented with biochemical and molecular technologies to differentiate Colletotrichum species (J. W.

All mango cultivars are susceptible, but Nam Dok Mai See Thong (NDMST) is the most vulnerable. Through a single spore isolation method, a total of 37 isolates of Colletotrichum spp. were obtained from NDMST showing anthracnose symptoms. Identification was performed using a combination of morphological characteristics, Koch\u2019s postulates, and phylogenetic analysis. The pathogenicity assay and Koch\u2019s postulates on leaves and fruit confirmed that all Colletotrichum spp. tested were causal agents of mango anthracnose. Multilocus analysis using DNA sequences of internal transcribed spacer (ITS) regions, \u03b2-tubulin (TUB2), actin (ACT), and chitin synthase (CHS-1) was performed for molecular identification. Two concatenated phylogenetic trees were constructed using either two loci (ITS and TUB2) or four loci (ITS, TUB2, ACT, and CHS-1).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

The taxonomy and phylogeny of the genus Colletotrichum remain confusing (Hyde et al., 2009; Cai et al., 2009). Historically, if anthracnose was found on a host for which there were no prior records of that fungus-host relationship, the species was interpreted as new and formally described (Cannon et al., 2000). This practice was later rejected (von Arx, 1957; Sutton, 1980; Baxter et al., 1983), yet new species are still occasionally described in Colletotrichum (Sivanesan et al., 1993; Nakanura et al., 2006; Liu et al., 2007). Currently, more than 688 epithets are listed in Index Fungorum (www.indexfungorum.org/names/names.asp).

Benzimidazoles are commonly applied as dips or sprays to inhibit the anthracnose-causing fungus, Colletotrichum spp. [141], but the large-scale and continuous use of fungicides has led to the development of fungal resistance. For instance, benzimidazole-resistant Colletotrichum has been detected in mangoes and bananas [140]. Additionally, the excessive use of fungicides negatively impacts human health and the environment, as chemical residues often contaminate soil and water [142]. Biocontrol offers an alternative, non-toxic method for managing fruit crop anthracnose.

During the 2015-16 California nursery crown rot outbreak, growers reported reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin dips, suggesting that resistance may also be present in California (K. Ivors, unpublished). A premixed product of the anilinopyrimidine cyprodinil and the phenylpyrrole fludioxonil is also registered, but phytotoxicity and stunting of plants have been reported under certain environmental conditions or following off-label exposure (G. Holmes, unpublished).', 0.9549835324287415]]\nContext 4: [['Until highly resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. The failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be attributed to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum species population. For example, benomyl was shown to effectively reduce the incidence of anthracnose crown rot (Horn et al., 1972; Howard, 1971) and was used intensively by strawberry growers for years to control anthracnose and other diseases. However, the anthracnose pathogens, C. acutatum and C. fragariae, developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides (LaMondia, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a; Smith and Black, 1992, 1993), leading to the ineffectiveness of benomyl for anthracnose control in strawberry fields.', 0.9372610449790955]]\nContext 5: [['Past failures of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may have stemmed from the development of resistance in the Colletotrichum population.

However, anthracnose pathogens developed resistance to it and other benzimidazole fungicides, rendering benomyl ineffective. In vitro and greenhouse trials have been conducted to identify fungicides to which Colletotrichum pathogens have developed resistance (LaMondia, 1993, 1995; McInnes et al., 1992a, 1992b; Smith and Black, 1991, 1992, 1993). Current fungicide labels address pathogen resistance by restricting the number of consecutive and total applications of a product per season. For instance, the fungicides Abound (azoxystrobin, Syngenta, Greensboro, NC), Cabrio (pyraclostrobin, BASF, Research Triangle Park, NC), and Pristine (pyraclostrobin and boscalid, BASF) are limited to four or five applications per season, with no more than two consecutive applications before alternating with a fungicide that has a different mode of action.

Following reports of reduced efficacy of azoxystrobin in the field, high levels of quinone outside inhibitor (QoI) resistance were detected in California isolates of the pathogen. Resistance was associated with the G143A mutation in the cytochrome b gene, similar to a previous report from Florida, and there were no detected fitness penalties in pathogenicity or virulence. Therefore, several alternative fungicides were investigated in laboratory and field studies. Subsequently, the new biofungicide natamycin was identified.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.7366616725921631]]\nContext 2: [['From May to September 1995, a severe outbreak of strawberry anthracnose was observed in several strawberry-growing nurseries in Israel.

Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9359126091003418]]\nContext 5: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms.

Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch.

The expression of the CtCut1 gene was studied through RNA-mediated gene silencing, and its impact on fungal pathogenicity was demonstrated. A vector, pAA1, encoding a hairpin RNA of GFP and CtCut1 was constructed and transformed into the virulent strain of C. truncatum, pathotype F8-3B.

However, artificial wounding of the cuticle allowed these F8-3B-pAA1 transformants to infect and colonize host tissues, resulting in typical anthracnose disease lesions. Coupled with microscopy, these data suggested that the defect in pathogenicity was likely due to a failure in penetrating the host cutin.

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9632675647735596]]\nContext 1: [['Ballington, J.R., J.L.

Species-specific primers have been designed based on the dissimilarities in the sequences of the ITS regions from various Colletotrichum species.

As shown in Figure 5A, a single PCR-amplified fragment of 490 bp was evident in isolates of C. acutatum from a broad host range but was absent in C. gloeosporioides isolates. Similarly, primers specific for C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae amplified a specific 450-bp fragment, allowing these two species to be distinguished from C. acutatum. This method also facilitated the differentiation between C. acutatum from almond, apple, peach, and strawberry, and C. gloeosporioides from papaya and citrus.

C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex are currently the most prevalent. The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift in the prevailing Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in various regions may be linked to global warming, changes in cultivation patterns\u2014from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation\u2014and the substitution of strawberry varieties.', 0.9851868748664856]]\nContext 1: [['Smith BJ, Black LL.

Subsequently, the prevalence of Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries in China was analyzed using available data. Finally, we categorized the host range of the two predominant species responsible for strawberry crown rot.

Due to restrictions associated with fungicide applications, their adverse environmental effects, and the potential development of resistance among fungal strains, the use of resistant cultivars is considered the most effective method for managing this disease. This study evaluated the reactions of 25 commercial strawberry cultivars against the fungus Colletotrichum nymphaeae, which causes AFR, using fruit, leaf, and crown-based assays. Results indicated that the cultivars exhibited varying reactions to the disease, depending on the inoculation of their leaves, fruits, and crowns with C. nymphaeae PET1 under in vivo and greenhouse conditions. The fruit-based assay was determined to be a better indicator of susceptibility to AFR due to the nature of the disease. Overall, 'Blakemore' and 'Kurdistan' cultivars showed significantly higher resistance compared to others, except for 'Aliso', 'Mrak', 'Diamant', 'Yallova', 'New Kurdistan', 'Mac Donance', and 'Ten Beauty'. Conversely, the 'Gaviota' cultivar was found to be significantly the most susceptible, aside from 'Camarosa'. The commonly grown commercial cultivars in Iran, including 'Camarosa', 'Paros', 'Pajaro', and 'Queen Eliza', were categorized as susceptible to highly susceptible in this study.

One study identified a significant cultivar by isolate interaction. Host resistance studies using homothallic G. cingulata isolates were less conclusive due to the limited number of isolates tested. Significant variation in cultivar susceptibility and isolate aggressiveness was observed, along with a significant cultivar by isolate interaction in one study. In a later study using a different set of isolates, only cultivar susceptibility varied. For C. acutatum, a specific interaction between strawberry cultivars and isolates was noted, with a single dominant gene appearing to be responsible for this interaction. This gene results in either an incompatible reaction with cultivars carrying it or an intermediate degree of compatibility. Assays used to evaluate resistance to C. fragariae and C. acutatum were based on symptom development on petioles or foliage and did not specifically assess the plants' ability to resist necrosis of crown tissue.

The current study aimed to investigate the major citrus production areas in Europe through large-scale sampling and to identify isolates using a polyphasic approach. This method revealed many cryptic and new Colletotrichum species associated with citrus, classified into four modern taxonomic species complexes. Surveys conducted in 2015 and 2016 across commercial nurseries, orchards, gardens, and plant collections aimed to determine the occurrence of Colletotrichum spp. related to citrus and allied genera (Atlantia, Fortunella, Microcitrus, Murraya, Poncirus). The study's specific objectives included conducting extensive sampling of fresh plant materials, cultivating Colletotrichum isolates, subjecting these isolates to DNA sequence analyses alongside morphological characterization, comparing results with other phylogenetic studies, and evaluating the pathogenicity of Colletotrichum species on citrus fruit. Major diseases of citrus caused by Colletotrichum species include postbloom fruit drop (PFD), petal necrosis, and key lime anthracnose (KLA), with C. abscissum and C. gloeosporioides being significant agents. Extensive investigations across several citrus-producing regions revealed varying associations of these pathogens with different citrus species.\", 0.9804056882858276]]\nContext 1: [['Timmer, L.W., & Brown, G.E.

Specifically, the internal transcribed spacers (ITS) flanking the 5.8S ribosomal RNA represent the most widely sequenced region in Colletotrichum phylogenetic studies. Consequently, ITS-based C. gloeosporioides specific primers (Mills et al., 1992) have been extensively utilized for identifying Colletotrichum fungi over the past 10 to 15 years. However, there are significant concerns regarding the resolving power of ITS for closely related species (Cai et al., 2009; Crouch et al., 2009b).

Moreover, conidial shape can show significant variation both within the species and among strains (Damm et al. 2012). Studies have shown that the fusiform conidial shape is not a consistent feature in the C. acutatum species complex. For instance, Talhinhas et al. (2002) noted that Colletotrichum isolates from Lupinus spp. (equivalent to C. lupini) displayed varying proportions of conidia with round ends or one round and one acute end, resulting in cylindrical or clavate shapes. In a recent investigation, many strains previously classified as C. gloeosporioides, based on typical cylindrical conidia (Cannon et al. 2008), were found to belong to different species within the C. acutatum complex (Damm et al. 2012). Additionally, there are species with acute-ended conidia that are phylogenetically distinct from the C. acutatum complex, such as C. pseudoacutatum and C. proteae (Cannon et al. 2012; Damm et al. 2012; Liu et al. 2013). The revision of the C. acutatum complex has recognized 31 species through a multilocus molecular approach, significantly advancing our understanding of these plant pathogens (Damm et al. 2012).', 0.1704297810792923]]\nContext 5: [['The general disease cycles of C. acutatum from different hosts often share common attributes. All produce acervuli with abundant conidia on one or more host tissues, and conidia are splash-dispersed, serving as the primary inoculum source for most infections.

The tissues on which sporulation and reproduction occur differ among various hosts, and the fate of appressoria and quiescent infections varies greatly. As far as is known, the sexual stage plays only a minor role in the life cycle of C. acutatum.

The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012).

Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.6732079386711121]]\nContext 1: [['In November 2021, anthracnose symptoms were observed on strawberries (cv.

Tomato seedlings (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill., cv. Bonnie Best) were grown in a pathogen-infested, soilless rockwool system in a greenhouse, using a nutrient solution with varied macro- and microelement concentrations. Disease severity was assessed after two weeks with an index ranging from 0 to 4, and plant fresh weight was measured. Regression analysis showed that disease severity significantly increased with ammonium-nitrogen sources, including NH4Cl, (NH4)6Mo7O24, and (NH4)2SO4, along with NaH2PO4\u00b7H2O, Fe-EDDHA, and MnSO4. Conversely, nitrate-nitrogen (Ca(NO3)2\u00b74H2O) and CuSO4\u00b75H2O reduced disease severity. Low rates of NH4NO3 (39 to 79 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N) were beneficial, but levels above 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N exacerbated the issue. MgSO4\u00b77H2O had no impact on disease. Notably, plant growth was inversely related to disease severity, and mineral fertilizers did not alter the pH of the nutrient solution. This information provides insights into the environmental factors influencing plant-pathogen interactions and can guide management strategies for Fusarium crown and root rot through host nutrition.', 0.9835102558135986]]\nContext 2: [['The form of nitrogen significantly influenced both the severity of Fusarium crown and root rot and the growth of tomato seedlings in a soilless rockwool system (Fig. 1). Increasing concentrations of nitrate-N reduced disease severity and improved plant growth compared to ammonium forms. Both ammonium sulfate and ammonium chloride produced similar responses, indicating that NH4+ was the harmful component (Fig. 1). Ammonium nitrate has been reported to either have no effect on Fusarium diseases or to increase disease severity, similar to ammonium-N (Jones et al., 1989; Schneider, 1985). While this was generally true for Fusarium crown and root rot, testing a range of concentrations revealed that at low concentrations (10 to 100 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N), ammonium nitrate reduced disease similarly to nitrate-N (Figs. 1D, 2D). However, the negative influence of the NH4+ ion became apparent at concentrations above 125 mg\u00b7L\u20131 N (Figs. 1D, 2D). At higher concentrations, seedlings might have lacked sufficient available carbohydrates to convert the excess ammonium, which is toxic for tomato seedlings (Woltz et al., 1992), into nontoxic amino acids (Pate, 1973). Nitrates have long been recognized for their role in reducing seedling diseases caused by Rhizoctonia solani (Huber and Watson, 1974); however, contradictory results have been reported for Fusarium crown and root rot. Mihuta-Grimm et al. (1990) noted that nitrogen supplied as a 20N\u201320P\u201320K fertilizer had no effect on the growth of F. oxysporum f.sp. radicis-lycopersici in rockwool compared to non-fertilized treatments. Jarvis and Thorpe (1980) found no effect of nitrogen form (with total N applied unspecified) on disease or yield when adequate lime was provided to counteract potential pH effects. In fact, the differential effect of nitrogen form on pH is a significant mechanism for suppressing many soilborne pathogens (Huber and Watson, 1974). In contrast, Woltz et al.

Infection of epidermal and mesophyll cells occurs after a symptomless biotrophic phase, leading to a necrotic phase in which host cells are killed and secondary hyphae grow both intra- and inter-cellularly (O'Connell et al., 2012). In some cases, the pathogen has a quiescent phase (Peres et al., 2005; Prusky et al., 2013), with the switch to the necrotrophic phase occurring only when host tissue and environmental conditions favor the continuation of the infection cycle.

Since its first report in the United States in 1931, strawberry anthracnose has spread globally, resulting in devastating economic, social, and ecological consequences. In many ways, producing organic strawberries is largely impractical because of this disease. Colletotrichum species pathogenic to strawberries have been extensively characterized. This review aims to provide an accurate inventory of these species by revisiting their discovery history over the past 90 years.

C. siamense and C. fructicola from the C. gloeosporioides sensu lato complex are currently the most prevalent. The prevalence of certain Colletotrichum species in strawberry fields in specific regions is influenced by the entire agricultural ecosystem, particularly through interconnections with neighboring plants and climate changes. The relative prevalence of different Colletotrichum species varies with geographic region and changes dynamically in certain areas. For example, in Shanghai, C. acutatum was identified before 2005 (Dai et al. 2006) but has not been detected since 2016 (Zhang et al. 2020). Similarly, an early report indicated that strawberry anthracnose caused by C. gloeosporioides was incidental, while C. acutatum was frequently detected (Kikuchi et al. 2010). However, a later study identified C. fructicola as the dominant virulent species on strawberries in Japan (Gan et al. 2017). Such shifts have also occurred in Korea (Nam et al. 2008, 2013). This shift in the prevailing Colletotrichum species associated with strawberries in various regions may be linked to global warming, changes in cultivation patterns\u2014from open fields to protected cultivation or soilless elevated cultivation\u2014and the substitution of strawberry varieties.', 0.9946059584617615]]\nContext 8: [['The difficulty in controlling anthracnose crown rot arises from the fact that Colletotrichum spp. can kill strawberry plants after aggressively invading crown tissue, with a long latent period during which no symptoms are visible. Additionally, there are no long-term effective fungicides available, and the diverse origins of the causal agents are unpredictable (Peres et al., 2017; Forcelini and Peres, 2018; Hirayama et al., 2018). Furthermore, Colletotrichum spp. can be dispersed from asymptomatic plants over long distances, while relevant quarantine measures for strawberry trade are lacking in China. Recognizing the causal agents is a prerequisite for disease control. Initially, identification largely depended on morphological observation and virulence tests. Repeated in vitro subculturing of microbes can alter both their morphology and virulence. The fact that morphological characteristics can vary based on host choice or environmental conditions poses a significant concern for fungal identification. Strawberry anthracnose was first reported nearly a century ago (Brooks, 1931). Through PCR and DNA sequencing techniques, researchers have clarified the genetic distinctions among Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, categorizing pathogens of worldwide origin into C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides (Mart\u00ednez-Culebras et al., 2000, 2003). However, ambiguously annotated data for Colletotrichum species frequently appear in GenBank, leading to confusion (Nilsson et al., 2006; Hyde et al., 2009). The emergence of multi-locus phylogeny has significantly aided in the identification of fungal species. Many pathologists and biologists have greatly expanded knowledge of Colletotrichum systematics (Cannon et al., 2012; Damm et al., 2012a, b; Weir et al., 2012), providing a solid foundation for future research. A landmark study corrected many synonymous names and offered a valuable reference for understanding Colletotrichum pathogens (Hyde et al., 2014).

Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019).

        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9575278162956238]]\nContext 1: [['From a historical perspective, identifying the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose has faced considerable confusion at the species level for a long time. This process has gradually evolved from coarse estimates to precise identifications, as noted by Ji et al. in Phytopathology Research (2022). The first report of strawberry infection by C. fragariae occurred over 90 years ago in the southeastern USA (Brooks 1931). Morphological observations make it difficult to distinguish C. fragariae from C. gloeosporioides, the latter of which was described in the nineteenth century for a pathogen isolated from citrus in Italy (Penzig 1882). Consequently, early-stage strawberry anthracnose was often attributed to either C. fragariae or C. gloeosporioides.', 0.9322248101234436]]\nContext 2: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide. Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.', 0.8332588076591492]]\nContext 3: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.8296349048614502]]\nContext 4: [['The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum.

These effects are observed under common irrigation practices in Brazil. The most likely explanation for this reduction is the decreased dispersal of Colletotrichum acutatum conidia, which relies heavily on water splash.

        "query": "Which fungal pathogens are primarily associated with anthracnose in strawberries?",
        "retrieved_context": "Context 0: [['Anthracnose is an important disease of strawberry caused by Colletotrichum spp., which affects foliage, runners, crowns, and fruits (Howard et al., 1992). Three primary fungal pathogens\u2014C. acutatum sensu lato, C. gloeosporioides sensu lato, and C. fragariae\u2014are known to cause anthracnose disease in strawberries (Freeman and Katan, 1997). The crown rot syndrome is characteristic of infections from C. gloeosporioides sensu lato and C. fragariae, while fruit rot is mainly attributed to C. acutatum sensu lato, leading to significant yield losses (Howard et al., 1992). Currently, numerous species are classified under what is now known as the C. acutatum complex, with six species\u2014C. acutatum sensu stricto, C. fioriniae, C. godetiae, C. nymphaeae, C. salicis, and C. simmondsii\u2014identified as associated with strawberry anthracnose worldwide (Damm et al., 2012). Among these, C. nymphaeae is the most prevalent pathogen causing strawberry anthracnose globally, including in Iran (Baroncelli et al., 2015; Karimi et al., 2017; Wang et al., 2019). Currently, no effective chemical control methods exist for managing strawberry anthracnose; available options are limited to preventive treatments applied before fruit production (Denoyes-Rothan et al., 1999). Additionally, concerns about the toxic effects of chemical fungicides on the environment and the development of resistance in fungal strains highlight the need for alternative control strategies. Consequently, utilizing resistant cultivars appears to be the most efficient and practical approach for suppressing anthracnose development. In light of recent anthracnose outbreaks in strawberry fields in the Kurdistan province of Iran (Karimi et al., 2017), and the necessity for appropriate strategies to address this issue, the aim of this study was to evaluate the resistance of several commercial strawberry cultivars to the anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. nymphaeae under in vivo and greenhouse conditions.', 0.9979627132415771]]\nContext 1: [['Strawberry anthracnose was first reported in China in 1990 (Hu, 1990). Shao (1992) documented the first instance of strawberry anthracnose in Shanghai, identifying the pathogen as Colletotrichum acutatum (Dai et al., 2006). Zhang et al. (2007) expanded on these findings by identifying C. gloeosporioides and C. fragariae (syn. C. theobromicola) as causal agents based on morphological characteristics. Ren et al. (2008, 2011) concluded that these three species are the main pathogens causing anthracnose in strawberries in China. Crown rot represents the most severe disease issue in many strawberry-producing regions of China (Ren et al., 2008). In the Zhejiang region, nearly 50% of seedling deaths in nurseries and over 40% yield losses in strawberry fields have been recorded (Xie et al., 2010). In 2009, the yield of greenhouse-cultivated strawberries in Donggang City, Liaoning Province, was reduced by over 10% due to crown rot (Wang, 2013). The average incidence of crown rot in greenhouses in Hubei Province was 41.7% in 2011 (Xiang et al., 2012). However, most studies conducted in China regarding this disease have primarily relied on morphological and single-gene (mainly ITS) analysis (Dai et al., 2006; Ren et al., 2008, 2011). Due to overlapping characteristics, species delimitation based solely on morphology is challenging in this genus. Employing multi-gene analysis alongside morphology can provide better resolution (Cai et al., 2009; Hyde et al., 2014). Therefore, the objective of this study was to identify the pathogens responsible for strawberry anthracnose in China using a morphological and multi-gene approach.', 0.9967225193977356]]\nContext 2: [['So far, anthracnose epidemics have affected strawberry nurseries and production fields worldwide. Reports on Colletotrichum spp. associated with strawberries, curated from literature in PubMed and Clarivate combined with fungal database searches (Farr and Rossman, 2022), were compiled to understand the global diversity and occurrence of the causal agents of strawberry anthracnose. From our findings, since 1931 until July 9, 2022, there have been over 220 citations and 310 records related to the identification of causal agents of strawberry anthracnose at the genus level of Colletotrichum in 36 countries across six continents, with 282 records providing pathogen identification at the species or species complex level.', 0.989168643951416]]\nContext 3: [['Baroncelli, R., Zapparata, A., Sarrocco, S., Sukno, S.A., Lane, C.R., Thon, M.R., Vannacci, G., Holub, E., and Sreenivasaprasad, S. 2015.

PLOS ONE, 10(6): e0129140.', 0.9769357442855835]]\nContext 4: [['Numerous reports indicate that strawberry anthracnose pathogens may originate from weed species. For instance, C. fragariae was found attacking the weed Cassia obtusifolia L. (sicklepod, coffeweed) in Florida, causing typical disease symptoms. Inoculation of strawberry with the Cassia isolates resulted in typical anthracnose symptoms, while isolates from strawberry were equally virulent on Cassia. Similarly, inoculation of Duchesnea indica (Andr.) Focke (wild strawberry), F. virginiana Duch. (Virginia wild strawberry), and Potentilla canadensis L. with C. fragariae induced anthracnose disease on these hosts, suggesting that strawberry anthracnose pathogens have a broad host range.', 0.9715908169746399]]\nContext 5: [[\"Anthracnose fungi can attack various parts of the strawberry plant, including crowns, petioles, leaves, fruit trusses, flowers, buds, and fruit. The fungi's ability to attack multiple plant parts, coupled with the involvement of several pathogen species, contributes to the complex nature of strawberry anthracnose. Brooks reported in 1931 that C. fragariae caused spotting and girdling of runners, and later indicated that it also caused spotting of petioles and crown rot in a summer nursery, leading to wilting and death of the plants. Researchers in Louisiana observed all these symptoms and noted that crown rot also occurred in the fruit production field.\", 0.961229681968689]]\nContext 6: [['The term \"anthracnose\" was first used to describe a new disease of strawberries caused by Colletotrichum fragariae Brooks. \"Strawberry anthracnose\" continues to be used as a general term to identify all diseases of strawberries caused by species of Colletotrichum. Strawberry anthracnose diseases have been reported to be caused by C. acutatum J.H. Simmonds, C. gloeosporioides (Penz.) Penz. & Sacc. in Penz. (the teleomorph of Cromereilla cingulata (Stoneman) Spauld. & H. Schrenk), and C. dematium (Pers.) Grove.
