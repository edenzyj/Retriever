Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm 
and humid  climates2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidem-
ics of strawberry anthracnose  disease3. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appres-
soria, then penetrate the epidermal  cells4. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, causing 
black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, 
and wilting of the whole plant due to crown  rot2. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange 
conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of 
up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the  field2. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings 
are propagated from March to September, and the high temperature, high humidity and heavy rainfall during

Duch.) are caused by the fungal pathogens Colletotrichum 
acutatum Simmonds, C. fragariae Brooks, and C. gloeosporioides 
(Penz.) Penz. and Sacc. (teleomorph Glomerella cingulata 
(Stonem.) Spauld. & Schrenk) (8,21–23,26). All three species in-
cite diseases, which cannot be distinguished in the field by symp-
toms alone. Petiole and stolon lesions occur on plants grown 
worldwide, but may go undetected in cool, dry areas where they 
cause little injury to the plants. C. fragariae is most often associ-
ated with anthracnose crown rot of strawberries grown in hot, 
humid areas such as the southeastern United States. Its host range 
is limited to strawberries and a few weeds (22). C. acutatum is the 
primary causal agent of anthracnose fruit rot, has a broader 
geographic and host range than C. fragariae (8,10,22), and is 
increasing in importance as a cause of petiole, stolon, crown, and 
root infections (7).

Colletotrichum species cause serious dis-
eases of many fruit and vegetable crops
worldwide, and three species, C. fragariae,
C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides, cause
anthracnose diseases of strawberry (Smith
and Black, 1990). Since the 1930s, anthrac-
nose crown rot caused by C. fragariae and
C. gloeosporioides has been a destructive
disease in strawberry nurseries and fruit-
production fields in the southeastern United
States (Brooks, 1931). In 1986, the presence
of the anthracnose fruit rot pathogen,
C. acutatum, was first reported on strawberry
in the United States (Smith and Black, 1986).
Increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and
crown rots in the United States since the
1980s may be related to the shift from
matted-row culture to the annual plasticulture
production system, as well as to changes in
cultivars. Anthracnose diseases are increas-
ing in importance and resulting in major
economic losses to strawberry growers
worldwide. The objective of this report is to
summarize anthracnose related research from
the United States (excluding research from
California and Florida) so that we can better
understand these diseases and their control.

1992; Smith, 1998a, 1988b, 1988c) cause
anthracnose diseases of strawberries. C. fra-
gariae was assumed to be the causal agent of
strawberry anthracnose in the United States
until 1986 when Smith and Black (1986)
reported the presence of C. acutatum on
strawberry in the United States. This fungus
had previously been reported to cause
anthracnose fruit rot of strawberry in Queens-
land, Australia (Simmonds, 1965); however,
it had probably been present in the United
States for some time under the name of
Gloeosporium spp. (Maas, 1984). Colletotri-
chum gloeosporioides causes anthracnose
crown rot, petiole lesions, and leaf spots
indistinguishable from those caused by
C. fragariae.
