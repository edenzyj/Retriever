Anthracnose caused by Colletotrichum spp. is a serious threat to strawberry production, especially in warm 
and humid  climates2. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidem-
ics of strawberry anthracnose  disease3. After landing on the plant surface, the conidia germinate, form appres-
soria, then penetrate the epidermal  cells4. Colletotrichum spp. can infect various strawberry tissues, causing 
black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, 
and wilting of the whole plant due to crown  rot2. Under high humidity, concentric rings of acervuli with orange 
conidial masses can be observed on necrotic tissues. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of 
up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the  field2. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings 
are propagated from March to September, and the high temperature, high humidity and heavy rainfall during
