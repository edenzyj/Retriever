This text appears to be a scientific article discussing the threat of anthracnose disease caused by Colletotrichum spp. to strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates. The article highlights the following points:

1. Rain-splashed conidia of Colletotrichum spp. serve as the major inoculum causing epidemics of strawberry anthracnose disease.
2. The conidia germinate, form appressoria, and penetrate epidermal cells, causing black spots or irregular spots on leaves, sunken black spots or necrosis lesions on petioles, stolons, and fruits, and wilting of the whole plant due to crown rot.
3. In the US state of Florida, anthracnose causes the death of up to 80% of seedlings in the nursery and yield losses of over 50% in the field.
4. In Taiwan, strawberry seedlings are propagated from March to September, and the high temperature, high humidity, and heavy rainfall during this period provide a suitable environment for epidemics.
5. From 2010 to 2016, anthracnose crown rot caused the loss of 30-40% of seedlings and ~20% of plants after transplanting.

The article seems to be discussing the significance of Colletotrichum spp. as a major pathogen affecting strawberry production, particularly in warm and humid climates, and highlighting the importance of understanding the disease mechanism and its impact on strawberry production.

Answer 1 :
This text appears to be a scientific article discussing the effectiveness of fungicides in controlling anthracnose and other diseases in strawberry plants. The article highlights the development of resistance to certain fungicides, such as benomyl, and the need for alternative treatments.

The text mentions several studies and researchers, including Horn et al. (1972), Howard (1971), LaMondia (1993, 1995), McInnes et al. (1992a, 1992b), Smith and Black (1991, 1992, 1993). These studies were conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of different fungicides, including benomyl, carbendazim, propiconazole, and captafol.

The article reports that benomyl was initially effective in controlling anthracnose, but the pathogens developed resistance to it and other bendimiazole fungicides. In-vitro trials were used to screen fungicides for their ability to control anthracnose, and Smith and Black (1993) found that all isolates of C. acutatum, C. fragariae, and C. gloeosporioides were resistant to benomyl.

The article also discusses the results of a greenhouse study, which found that plants treated with propiconazole had lower disease severity ratings than those treated with captafol or benomyl. However, the propiconazole-treated plants were shorter with thicker leaves than the untreated plants.

Overall, the article highlights the importance of monitoring the effectiveness of fungicides and developing alternative treatments to control diseases in strawberry plants.

Answer 2 :
This text is discussing the importance of in-vitro fungicide studies for controlling anthracnose, a fungal disease that affects crops. The text states that until resistant cultivars are available, growers must rely on chemical applications and cultural practices to reduce losses due to anthracnose. However, the text also notes that failure of fungicides to control anthracnose epidemics may be due to the development of fungicide resistance in the Colletotrichum spp. population.

In other words, the text is highlighting the need for effective fungicide management strategies to control anthracnose, as the fungus that causes the disease (Colletotrichum spp.) can develop resistance to fungicides over time. This emphasizes the importance of in-vitro fungicide studies to identify effective fungicides and develop strategies to prevent or delay the development of resistance.

2. **Living mulches**: The text recommends using living mulches, such as wheat, rye, or rye grass, in row middles to reduce disease spread within a field. This is because living mulches can help absorb water and reduce splashing.
3. **Sublethal doses of herbicides**: The text suggests using sublethal doses of grass-specific herbicides, such as sethoxydim, to prevent excessive growth of ryegrass.
4. **Organic mulches**: The text recommends using organic mulches, such as wheat straw or pine needles, to reduce splash and lower the incidence of anthracnose.
5. **Drip irrigation**: The text states that anthracnose is less severe when water is supplied to plants using drip irrigation rather than overhead irrigation.

Overall, the text provides several strategies for preventing the spread of anthracnose within a field, including using living mulches, organic mulches, and drip irrigation, and reducing water splashing and excessive plant growth.

Answer 5 :
This text is discussing the pathogens that cause anthracnose diseases in strawberries. Specifically, it mentions three species of Colletotrichum: C. fragariae, C. acutatum, and C. gloeosporioides.

According to the text, C. fragariae was previously considered the primary cause of strawberry anthracnose in the United States. However, in 1986, Smith and Black reported the presence of C. acutatum on strawberry in the United States. This fungus had previously been reported to cause anthracnose fruit rot of strawberry in Queensland, Australia, but it was likely present in the United States under the name Gloeosporium spp. for some time.

The text also mentions that C. gloeosporioides causes anthracnose crown rot, petiole lesions, and leaf spots that are indistinguishable from those caused by C. fragariae.

Overall, the text highlights the complexity of the relationships between Colletotrichum species and their hosts, and suggests that multiple species may be involved in causing anthracnose diseases in strawberries.

Answer 8 :
The text is providing advice on how to reduce the buildup of anthracnose fruit rot in a field. The primary means of reducing the buildup is to:

1. Harvest fruit frequently: Regularly picking fruit can help reduce the spread of the disease.
2. Remove all rotten fruit from the field: Any fruit that has already been infected should be removed to prevent the disease from spreading further.
3. Strip infected fruit from plants and remove from the field: If the infection occurs early in the fruiting season, all infected fruit should be removed from the plants to prevent the disease from spreading.
4. Harvest infected areas last: When harvesting, it's best to start with the un-infected areas and work towards the infected areas to minimize the risk of spreading the disease.
5. Wash and change clothes when entering un-infected areas: After harvesting in areas where fruit rot is present, workers should wash their hands and change their clothes before entering un-infected areas to prevent the spread of the disease.

By following these steps, farmers can help reduce the buildup of anthracnose fruit rot in their field and prevent the disease from spreading further.

	+ Captan + fenhexamid
	+ Captan

Answer 10 :
This is a scientific article published in the journal Frontiers in Plant Science, titled "Development of a model for Colletotrichum diseases with calibration for phylogenetic clades on different host plants". Here's a summary of the article:

**Background**: Fungi in the genus Colletotrichum cause significant losses to various agricultural crops worldwide. The authors aim to develop a mechanistic model to predict anthracnose progress on aerial organs of different crops, taking into account the pathogen's life cycle and weather effects.

**Methodology**: The authors conducted a systematic literature review to gather published information on Colletotrichum anthracnose diseases on different host plants. They developed a model incorporating the main stages of the pathogen's life cycle and weather effects. The model was parameterized for seven Colletotrichum clades (acutatum, dematium, destructivum, gloeosporioides, graminicola, and orbiculare) and the singleton species, C. coccodes.

**Results**: The model was evaluated for anthracnose diseases caused by fungi belonging to five clades on six hosts using data from 17 epidemics in Italy, the USA, Canada, and Japan. The comparison of observed versus predicted data showed a concordance correlation coefficient of 0.928 and an average distance between real data and the fitted line of 0.044.

**Conclusion**: The developed model can predict anthracnose progress on aerial organs of different crops, taking into account the pathogen's life cycle and weather effects. The model was calibrated for seven Colletotrichum clades and can be used to inform disease management strategies and predict disease outbreaks.

The article is written in a formal and technical tone, using specialized vocabulary and abbreviations (e.g., DOI, DOI 10.3389/fpls.2023.1069092). The authors assume a high level of background knowledge in plant pathology and epidemiology.

Answer 11 :
This is a scientific text that discusses the relationship between nutrient levels and anthracnose in strawberries. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

1. Increasing nitrogen and potassium in nutrient solutions can lead to higher dry matter percentages of these elements in strawberries.
2. However, this increased nutrient level can also increase the severity of anthracnose, a fungal disease that affects strawberries.
3. To mitigate the effects of anthracnose, it is recommended to use a fertilizer that contains a minimum amount of nitrogen and potassium, but not exceeding 15 and 10 units, respectively.

The text suggests that a balanced fertilizer with moderate levels of nitrogen and potassium is necessary to promote healthy strawberry growth while minimizing the risk of anthracnose.

Answer 12 :
This text appears to be a passage from a scientific paper or article about controlling anthracnose, a fungal disease that affects strawberries. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

* The primary source of infection in most strawberry fields is infected transplants.
* To prevent the spread of anthracnose, strawberry growers in the southeastern United States were advised to obtain their transplants from nurseries in the northern United States, Canada, or California, which are outside the range of the fungus Colletotrichum fragariae.
* However, more recently, the fungus C. acutatum has been found in some nurseries in these areas, which means that even these supposedly "safe" sources may not be reliable.

The reference [37] likely refers to a specific study or publication by McInnes et al. that supports the information presented in this passage.

Answer 13 :
The conclusion is that:

* As knowledge of anthracnose pathogens and epidemiology has increased, so has the ability to control the disease.
* Changes in cultural practices have reduced the levels of disease.
* Development of more effective fungicides and their registration for use on strawberries have greatly reduced losses due to anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot.
* Anthracnose-resistant cultivars have also reduced economic losses due to these diseases.
* However, growers may still sustain severe losses when environmental factors are highly favorable for anthracnose development.

Answer 14 :
Here is a rewritten version of the text in a clear and concise manner:

"Despite limited research on the impact of plant nutrition on strawberry anthracnose, this study aimed to explore the effects of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium concentrations on the development of the disease. The ultimate goal is to develop practical strategies for managing strawberry anthracnose."

Answer 16 :
This text discusses the control of anthracnose disease in sorghum fields. The main points are:

1. Crop debris removal can reduce anthracnose severity by about 30%.
2. Using resistant cultivars could be an environmentally friendly and cost-effective way to control the disease, but currently available cultivars may not provide enough resistance.
3. Biological control agents (BCAs) such as Trichoderma spp. and Bacillus subtilus have been considered, but their efficacy is variable under field conditions.
4. Many farmers still prefer combining cultural practices and chemical control methods, which may lead to intensive fungicide sprays.
5. Calendar-based application of chemicals remains the main tool for controlling anthracnose diseases, which may involve needless applications that are not economically or ecologically sustainable.

Overall, the text highlights the need for more effective and sustainable methods of controlling anthracnose disease, and suggests that a combination of cultural practices and biological control agents may be a more environmentally friendly and cost-effective approach.

Answer 24 :
This passage discusses the effects of nitrogen and calcium levels in soil on the severity of anthracnose crown rot and fruit rot in strawberries.

The main points of the passage are:

1. In commercial fields, anthracnose crown rot is less severe when strawberries are grown on soils with low nitrogen fertility (Howard et al., 1992).
2. In greenhouse studies, strawberries grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen, especially from ammonium sources, are more susceptible to anthracnose than plants grown in soils with lower nitrogen levels or those with high levels of calcium nitrate (Smith, 1987, 1989).
3. Anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. acutatum is less severe on fruit from greenhouse-grown plants receiving drench or foliar applications of calcium sulfate than on fruit from plants receiving water, calcium chloride, or calcium nitrate treatments.
4. Fruit from plants receiving foliar applications of CaCl2 developed less fruit rot than that from plants receiving soil applications of CaCl2 (Smith and Gupton, 1993).

Overall, the passage suggests that strawberries are more susceptible to anthracnose when grown in soils with high levels of nitrogen and that calcium sulfate and CaCl2 may help reduce the severity of anthracnose fruit rot.

This passage describes the development of a mathematical model to simulate the spread of anthracnose diseases caused by Colletotrichum species. The model is designed to be general, meaning it can be applied to different species, clades, and host plants, and is driven by weather conditions.

The model development process involved several steps:

1. Conducting a systematic literature search to gather information on Colletotrichum anthracnose diseases.
2. Developing a conceptual model of the diseases using systems analysis.
3. Creating mathematical equations to describe the system dynamically and quantitatively.
4. Calibrating the model for seven major clades and the singleton species C. coccodes (also referred to as the coccodes clade).
5. Evaluating the model's ability to represent the real system.

The model is designed to incorporate key epidemiological components and account for the effects of external variables, such as environmental and host-related factors. The model can be used to simulate the spread of anthracnose diseases and inform management strategies to control the diseases.

Answer 32 :
This text appears to be a scientific article discussing the relationship between nutrient concentrations and the development of anthracnose disease in strawberry plants.

The article reviews previous studies that have shown correlations between nitrogen concentration and severity of anthracnose, as well as the effects of calcium and manganese on disease development. It notes that while calcium has been shown to inhibit anthracnose in some studies, no effect was found in the current study.

The article then presents the results of the current study, which investigated the effects of different concentrations of nitrogen, phosphorus, potassium, and calcium on strawberry plant growth and anthracnose development. The results are summarized in tables and figures.

The tables present the regression equations and coefficients for each nutrient, showing the relationship between concentration and plant dry weight. The figures show the development of anthracnose and nutrient concentration in strawberry plants treated with different concentrations of each nutrient.

The article concludes that while manganese content may be related to anthracnose development, further research is needed to determine this. It also notes that phosphorus supplied as phosphite was effective at reducing phytophthora root and crown rot in tomato and pepper plants, but suppressed plant growth.

Answer 33 :
The passage suggests that:

* The shift from matted-row culture to annual plasticulture production system in the United States may be contributing to increased losses due to anthracnose fruit and crown rots.
* Breeding for genetic resistance to anthracnose and developing resistant cultivars are primary means to reduce economic losses due to this disease.
* This approach is environmentally sound because it reduces the use of fungicides, which is a chemical-based solution to the problem.

Answer 46 :
This text describes the process of breeding strawberries for resistance to anthracnose, a fungal disease caused by Colletotrichum fragariae. Here's a breakdown of the main points:

1. **Breeding process**: Strawberry seeds from crosses made at Beltsville were germinated at Poplarville, and the resulting seedlings were inoculated with a fungal suspension of C. fragariae. The seedlings were then evaluated for anthracnose severity 30 days after inoculation.
2. **Selection criteria**: Resistant seedlings were selected based on yield, fruit quality, plant habit, and resistance to other diseases such as leaf scorch, leaf spot, powdery mildew, and two-spotted spider mites.
3. **Field testing**: The resistant seedlings were field-tested in several states, including Florida, Louisiana, Mississippi, Maryland, and North Carolina.
4. **Release of resistant clones**: Four anthracnose-resistant strawberry clones were released as breeding lines and have been used as a source of resistance in several breeding programs.
5. **Release of the cultivar Pelican**: The cultivar Pelican was released, which is highly resistant to both anthracnose crown rot and anthracnose fruit rot caused by C. fragariae, as well as five races of red stele caused by Phytophthora fragariae.
6. **Ongoing evaluation**: The USDA anthracnose-resistance screening procedure is an ongoing project, and over 32,000 resistant strawberry seedlings were identified between 1998 and 1999 from the North Carolina State University breeding program.

Answer 47 :
The text discusses the inheritance of resistance to anthracnose in runners. The main points are:

1. **Dominance genetic variance is higher**: Gupton and Smith (1991) found that the estimates of dominance genetic variance were 6-10 times higher than those for additive genetic variance.
2. **Bimodal frequency distribution**: The frequency distribution of disease severity ratings was bimodal, suggesting major gene action.
3. **Heritability estimates**: Narrow-sense heritability estimates were 0.37 and 0.26, which are sufficient to produce gains from recurrent selection. Broad-sense heritability estimates were 0.87 and 0.85, indicating that selection of clonal value is possible.
4. **Non-additive effects**: Giménez and Ballington (2002) found that non-additive effects were more important than additive effects in the inheritance of resistance.
5. **Epistatic nature**: The epistatic nature of anthracnose resistance on runners is supported by the results of crosses between susceptible parents, which can produce up to 20% resistant seedlings.
6. **Quantitative inheritance**: The frequency distribution of lesion lengths within progenies suggests that resistance to C. acutatum on runners is quantitative. Results from Garcés et al. (2002) also support the theory that inheritance of resistance to anthracnose is quantitative in nature.

Answer 49 :
This text is discussing the results of a model that was developed to predict anthracnose epidemics. The model was validated using independent data, meaning data that was not used to train the model. The results show that the model was able to make accurate and robust predictions, with a high concordance between the model's predictions and reality (CCC = 0.928). This means that the model was able to correctly predict the outcome of the anthracnose epidemics most of the time.

The text also mentions that the model had few errors (RMSE = 0.044), which means that the predictions were very close to the actual outcomes. The only issue was that the model tended to overestimate the outcome, but this was not a significant problem.

Overall, the text is saying that the model was very effective at predicting anthracnose epidemics, and that the assumptions and simplifications made in developing the model did not greatly reduce its ability to make correct predictions.
